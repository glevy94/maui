East Maui and West Maui throughout the last decade or so. We have in-stream flow standards in West Kauaʻi, north and south shores, and we are currently working to develop them in Southeast Kauaʻi. Last year, we established in-stream flow standards on Molokai. And in 2020 and 2021, we established in-stream flow standards in Kaukonahua, and then the Waiāhole Ditch case established them in the Waiāhole area.

The Waikoloa Stream on the Big Island -- can you see my cursor? Anyway, this blue segment on the Big Island is our -- and Wailua on Kauaʻi are two areas of focus right now where we have developed an in-stream flow standard assessment report, which is the compilation of best-available information, and we are working with the water users and the community to develop an in-stream flow standard or an interim in-stream flow standard that protects public trust uses.

Here is the draft in-stream flow standard assessment report that we published online in June, and we have sent out notices via email to stakeholders throughout the Waikoloa and Hawaiʻi Island region. We have a landing page for the in-stream flow standard report online. The report utilizes a seepage run conducted by the US Geological Survey in 2021 which measured seepage gains and losses through the main stem of Waikoloa Stream from its headwaters down to the mouth, and so the headwaters is this stream branch -- sorry, you can't see my pointer.
