Briefing on the Outcomes of the 2023-2024 Legislative Biennium Related to the Commission on Water Resource Management
PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Deputy Dean Uyeno & Katie Roth, Planning Branch Chief
Staff presented the outcome of bills related to the Commission during the 2023-2024 Legislative Biennium which included HB1800, HB1900, SB3327, and HB2690.
I suspect there’s a greater will now, in light of Lahaina, that people may be motivated, government entities may be motivated if there’s a comprehensive plan, so good.
If I can just make a comment to that, Chair Linda Ichiyama who’s head of Water and Land for the House side, she did have Kaleo at the beginning of the year do a, what was she calling it, like a lunch hour, but he did a presentation on the Hawaiʻi mesonet. I really do think having those kinds of opportunities to meet with the legislators about some of the initiatives that we’re working on makes a difference. We are encouraging all of our divisions to, where we can, whether they’re site visits or whether they’re training opportunities or providing them more information, but that really does seem to help with the legislators. I appreciate that effort and I think it resulted in the funding and Chair Ichiyama’s champion of, she’s been extremely helpful for DLNR.
I seem to recall we had advanced consideration of the budget matters, that you brought them here under some briefing and that this is what was going to be in the budget and we see what we worked out. I don’t remember a Commission discussion of this matter and is it our role to consider these things when they’re in process, not like this after the fact and to help inform that position, Department takes?
You’re talking about the SB3327?
Yeah.
Well, this one, the SB or did you want to do the Red Hill WAI?
Well, both and it’s a general, it’s a broad question. There’s a specific case here a couple a couple bills here, but it’s the responsibility of the Commission to consider testimony on kind of the unplanned items that get introduced along the way. Do we weigh in at all on shaping the Commission’s position?
I should defer to Chair for that.
I think once when we brought that to the Commission, those were administrative bills.
The budget matters.
Yeah, the budget as well as proposed legislation. These two were legislative initiatives so House-Senate Bill 3327 came from both Water Land, but Senator Inouye. I think this was in response to numerous things that happened over in the Maui wildfires, but it kind of morphed and we did bring this back to the Commission.
Back in February.
We presented a more informational and that’s when I did ask, we did a legislative update. I had Dean prepare all the bills that were going through and this one Senate Bill 3327 and we did ask all the Commission. I think Neil, you were not here that day.
There was a discussion about Commissioners can as individuals testify.
By himself but was the only one who had lodged, Larry’s on here, he can speak for himself, but had an objection to Senate Bill 3327 which more shaped my testimony as a chairperson because I was both support, comments and oppose and after having the opportunity to have the Commission weigh in on that, then I took a different...well we still provided comments, support, opposition but it was more in opposition to taking CWRM out of DLNR. House Bill 2690 and the Red Hill WAI did not come to the Water Commission because it was more of an initiative that was being driven, quite frankly it was a legislative initiative by the House and the Senate leadership. In light of Red Hill, DLNR was part of some discussions with various State agencies as well as the city to have a unified statement regarding Red Hill both the defueling and the remediation. The Red Hill WAI, the implementation was, this bill was designed to have capacity, three people out of the chairperson’s office that would help coordinate, establish a fund in anticipation that federal funds would be appropriated for the Red Hill remediation that they could be housed in this fund. It was also to implement some of the Red Hill initiatives and to help do the community outreach. That bill unfortunately it did die as a result of coming in and adding the Senate Bill 3327. We did come back and brief the Commission, but you’re correct, that is the meeting you were not here.
I have a few questions, it’s mostly about the process. If I remember correctly, the Commission never had a position on these bills that were being introduced and that when we had that discussion, it was basically said while we can see on the website where these bills are going to go and that we could testify for, against, or comment on the bills as individual Commissioners. I’m okay with that, but I think that it’s an obligation of the Department that if there are bills coming up like that not to say, oh you guys can go to Legislature or look at their website and find out what’s going on. I think it’s an obligation to let us know what’s going on during the legislative process and that wasn’t there. The other thing I wanted to ask was clearly the bill that did all those changes, proposed changes for the Commission, was a result of people’s dissatisfaction with what happened in Lahaina, but who exactly introduced those bills? Do you have any idea? I’m sure you guys know where it came from.
It was Senator Inyoue who introduced the Senate bill.
But who was the force behind that? I know some of the people that have been involved in Water Commission issues for years have voiced their dissatisfaction with how the Commission has operated. I think also with the advice we have been getting from the Attorney General’s office, in my experience over 25 years, you all know that I’m not really happy with the advice that we have gotten from the Attorney General’s office. I guess then what happened was that people went to various legislators and had them sponsor bills that were reflecting their positions, correct?
That may be true, I don’t know. Senator Inouye was the champion of this bill. I don’t know who may have approached her or whether there were any special interests, but she was very...
All legislation is special interest.
I was going to say that’s standard practice for some.
I don’t know, Larry, who may have.
All I’m asking is that when we begin the legislative session again, don’t just give us a one-time update about what’s going on. I think that during the legislative session, every time we have a meeting, we should have a brief update about what’s going on and not leaving it to us as individual Commissioners to decide where we want to get involved or not.
I as a follow up, our names as Commissioners are on the corner of everything that gets signed by staff, but I don’t feel that we always...that public meeting was more informational and it wasn’t necessarily an invitation. I’ll just say the complexity of the issue, it’s not always a comfortable space when we have the AG and Chair and if there is our dissenting views, to be honest about- the merits of these kinds of- to have a really honest and open discussion about that. I guess in the spirit of civic engagement, maybe we should.
We should.
I think if I could make a request for next session it be that. Maybe it’s hard right? The legislation gets introduced in what, January? I mean the timing of it is hard.
The best thing we can do is once...Michael Yoshinaga, he used to be with our office and was kind of the departmental legislative coordinator or was the departmental coordinator, retired at the end of last year. Because of that, all the divisions have been tasked to basically review all the bills themselves and identify which ones are relevant to their divisions. Thankfully we have Alexa who with her attorney background or law background, she’s very excited about the bills, but she did a great job in reviewing everything. After that, once we’ve reviewed it, we create a spreadsheet and then within our staff will identify who the lead branch is, basically, and then we’ll have a spreadsheet. I think the best thing we can do is provide that spreadsheet to you folks at the beginning of the session and get your feedback, recognizing that it is a very quick turnaround. Once Leg(islature) gets going, we only have sometimes 48 hours, 72 hours to turn around our testimony and even then the bill is changing, at times. I think the only opportunity we can really outreach to you folks is at the beginning, after that it’s very difficult to.
Sorry, I interrupted you. Is that it? Thinking about the format of meetings and Sunshine, perhaps staff could solicit us individually for comments and take that in as you develop your Commission position, otherwise we would have to have it in full Sunshine. That could be really long and complicated, but just general comments. Is that a potential?
The difficulty I have with that is if the Commission is going to take a position, in my mind it should be in an open discussion and we should all vote on it. Rather than putting the bill on the staff to try to decipher, okay some Commissioner saidv this. That’s a challenge. I think what we can try to do, I like Larry’s comment, included in all the agenda items, included information updates on legislation. Normally, probably starting August, the departments are beginning to come in with developing their administrative bills. As we develop our administrative bills, what we can do is have a meeting included in one of our Water Commission meetings proposed legislation. I think what we saw was the penalty bill was an important one, the other important one was emergency powers. If we’re going to do that because what I want to probably start June and I have initiated, is to have regular meetings with Dean and all of the County water directors and so that when we’re proposing a legislation, to give them an advanced warning. I don’t want us to come into the Leg(islature) where we’ve got the water departments at odds with us and that’s what we did for those two bills. They came in during the veto period and opposed us, so I think we want to start and we should be much more collaborative with the counties, as well. When we’re coming we can have a meeting maybe in July or August with the Commission to talk about proposed legislation, get the Commissioner’s input, staff can develop some draft administrative bills and then I think we can actually take a formal position on those as a Commission. Do we as a Commission support this so that when we testify because normally when we draft testimony, it’s really the chairperson of the Commission. But if we know that it’s the Commission that supports this, it can be taken at a publicly noticed meeting, the Commission supports this administrative bill. We won’t know what the non- administrative bills are until they’re actually introduced probably come January or February and then we can provide you an update. If the Commission feels that they can take a position on proposed legislation, we can do that, but I think procedurally we will try to include Commission, get some guidance from you on proposed legislation, get a Commission decision if one can be made, and then two, move forward with the legislative session in January as new bills get introduced that may affect the Commission or CWRM. We’ll include that as regular updates on our monthly meetings. Because Larry, what I have found at the Legislature, you got to show up, you got to be present and there are people who do show up. But it is helpful to have testimony written or oral testimony for various bills that we are trying to initiate. It’s very hard when the only person sitting, defending a bill is just the Department. I know that on the other hand, unless we keep the Commission informed or our stakeholders informed, not everybody may have the same sense of urgency as we do, so we’ll try to do a better job of keeping the Commissioners and our stakeholders informed of various proposed legislation.
I think for the matters that we can as a Commission, as a body, really comment on, I think I would like to be able to collectively support those and publicly support those to ensure their success, especially if they’re really important for functioning. This sounds like a good plan to pregame a little bit and have those updates. Thank you.
The reason I bring this up is that we have all these proposed significant changes going on and as far as us as individual Commissioners, we’re sort of like passive watchers and that’s kind of frustrating to be in that position. The other thing I wanted to ask was that we all know that bills get introduced, but it might take several years before certain ones get passed. It would be interesting to see what the Department’s assessment is of the ones in this legislative session that made it fairly far along but then never made it through. When do you expect them to be reintroduced again and just to give us a heads up again. The other thing is that maybe we should also have a discussion during Commission meetings well before the legislative session about whether there are certain issues that we as individual or collectively as Commissioners would like to see legislation introduced. I for one think there’s a lot of issues around designation of Water Management Areas that we really need to strengthen. Anyway, that’s my three cents [inaudible].
I’d like to respond to that.
I’ll build on Larry’s point that we know these issues will be back, right? These are issues, like you say, these things, bills, concepts tend to have a multi-year gestation period so there should be no surprise when we see these again next year. The issue of fines, the issues of emergency powers, the issue of independence and so forth. Fostering some kind of healthy discussion not when you’re in the middle of the session and things are flying and bills are being moved around, but just a healthy discussion of this, I think at some advanced point would be a really good idea because it’s not going away.
I agree. I see the role as a Commission, the Commission makes policy. Legislation is also part of policy. The role of CWRM is actually to implement the Commission’s policy, so I do think it is worthwhile for us as a Commission to have some of those conversations and to talk about what kinds of policy changes. Whether, as Larry talks about Water Management Areas or the administration of CWRM, to me those are policy discussions that we should have. In the absence of them, yes, the chairperson then represents the Commission, but it may not necessarily represent all of the Commission’s wishes. It would be helpful to have a discussion when we’re not at a point where we have to make a decision, but as you say sort of safe space to have open discussions about that.
I’ll add this. This young lady came on board, she approached me at a conference and said if I had any advice for her. I said if you think of things as hard or challenging, they tend to self-fulfill, it becomes hard. To me, it’s not so much that these are hard discussions as they’re deep discussions, they’re philosophically important discussions. The whole issue of independence for instance is not so much about, we have a problem with you or this administration and so forth, it’s the idea that the protection of a public trust asset, people need to represent the unborn and not the current electorate. If this administration is going to stand up for the people who put them in office, which they should, we get that, but sometimes an asset like this can’t be managed to just the needs of this generation. That’s the philosophical discussion. It’s not a condemnation of anybody’s behaviors or motives and so forth, it’s just I think we would welcome that kind of deep philosophical discussion. What’s the right path, what’s the thing that takes care of the needs of today, but also adequately protects our future generations who aren’t voting today? They’re not putting this Governor or this legislator in office. I think that’s an important part of our duty, but that’s just me. Others may feel different.
I appreciate the discussion.
I do want to applaud and recognize the efforts of Katie and Kaleo last year worked with our Congressional delegates in getting some additional funds for monitoring. I think that’s a source that we have not really fully tapped into, federal funding. I am encouraging all of our divisions to start looking at available federal funds to supplement monies that we get from the leg(islature). Any other questions? Anything else?
Just a comment, I strongly support the greater collaboration with the Counties and the various public Departments of Water Supply and in particular, taking the time to be more involved in the formative process of legislation, as Larry recommended. I, for one, would be happy to devote the time to that and I think that’s a critical component of the mission and functioning as has been echoed by Neil, as well, that we do that going forward. It requires a personal commitment, perhaps even an executive session as opposed to more formal meetings with the complications involved, but I think that’s a very important function of this Commission and we should proceed to activate that, Chair.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Meyer. I hear a uniform voice of our water Commissioners supporting being more involved in legislation in a proactive way and being regularly updated. I have found that collaboration and keeping people informed is really critical to the success of all the work that we do. The water directors, they are a key component to some of the work that we do, so I am finding opportunities, having monthly meetings with all the water departments so we can update them on what we’re doing. They can update us with what they’re doing, but also talking about collaboration when we move into legislation rather than being at odds, being together, so addressing proactively their issues.
I do have one question since we do need to work with counties, but because our mission is public trust, are we investing the same effort in communicating with a variety of stakeholders? I guess I just want to be cognizant of sometimes the utilities and public trust purposes are at odds, so just ensuring that we’re proceeding in ways that are going to not apparently say “fast track” permits, but really show that we’re doing our consideration of the multiple values. I’ll always just sort of prod at that, but I agree, we do need to be in coordination if we want to see our infrastructural improvements go forward.
It’s also getting good information from them. They’re doing a lot of water development wells. What I’m finding is that there’s a gap between, we’re not finding opportunities to share information. For example, when we’re talking to Hawaiʻi Island about doing this regional monitoring system, we don’t know what they’re monitoring, they don’t know what we’re monitoring, so just trying to have government entities work more collaboratively so that we can, rather than either duplicating or find where are we missing gaps, to do better, to service the people better. Far from fast tracking anybody’s permit, it’s looking at how can we be more efficient with our limited resources by working together. We’re looking at the placement of new wells, is there a gap that they’re finding, so I think there is value in those kinds of conversations with the regulators who provide. But your comment is well taken that we shouldn’t only be having conversations in our Commission meetings, but I also see staff doing a lot of work in going out to the communities and the different plans that they’re coming up with.
Not just because of optics, but when people are not in certain conversations, there can be constructions of explanations of what’s happening that are not reflective of what the dialogues are focused on. But I do know that the utilities know their systems and know their wells and that’s something we haven’t always been able to share on. I appreciate this dialogue about the broader needs.
