DEPUTY MANUEL: Yeah, he's excused.  
CHAIR CHANG: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Wayne Meyer is excused, so we -- actually, Paul Meyer. I am going to get it together. I'm just so excited because I've got [my bud] Mike Buck sitting next to me, but I apologize. So our commissioner, Mr. Meyer, is not here today, so all of the commissioners are here in the boardroom.  

And we actually have a reason why we're all here today. It's because today is Commissioner Mike Buck's last meeting. Let's give him a round of applause.  
(Applause.)  
CHAIR CHANG: We are extremely grateful for the time that Mike has been here. I mean, Mike has been here both -- he sat on the other side of the table as -- as a member of DLNR staff for many years, retired, thought he was going off into the sunset and do farming, but we pulled him back to sit on the Water Commission. We've been extremely grateful for his -- eight years?
