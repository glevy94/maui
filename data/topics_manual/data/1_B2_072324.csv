Declaratory Ruling No. DEC-MA24-G7, No Water Use Permit Requirement, Pursuant to Hawai‘i Revised Statutes Section 174C-48(a), For Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. to Deliver Water to Its Customer TY Management Corporation for Kapalua Village Temporary Housing Project, TMK (2) 4-2- 004:036, Honolua Ground Water Management Area, Maui
Deputy Dean Uyeno; Robert Strand, Onaona Thoene – Carlsmith Ball on behalf of TY Management Corporation
Staff stated the summary of request for a declaratory ruling to clarify that the Commission will not require a water use permit to be issued for Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc.’s delivery of water to its customer TY Management Corporation for 50 temporary modular housing units until the year 2031.
Thank you very much, Dean. I'd just like to add to that, if you recall several months ago staff did a briefing to the Water Commission on the Maui temp housing to support the displaced residents of Maui, the fire displaced residents. We did share with you that if the water was coming from the County of Maui, under the Code, we would permit that to be an existing use if Maui County Water Department was servicing the Maui temp housing. However, this is a different circumstance and this circumstance we have a private water purveyor but also providing support to Maui temp housing, specifically for their employees. Rather than seek a suspension from Executive Emergency Proclamation suspending 174C to account for these unique situations, under the Code we have the authority to request a declaratory ruling by the Commission that a permit is not required given these unique circumstances. Given this situation, we chose to come to the Water Commission to seek a declaratory ruling that it's not that we wouldn't enforce, but we would not require a permit for this Maui temp housing, given that there is sufficient water in this aquifer and it is for Maui temp housing. Anything beyond that would require a water use permit and they've completed all the processes. We are continuing to move forward on the water designation process, but given the timing, of the necessity to build that these are clearly temporary housing units and that they are being put on the Kapalua Golf Course, I think CWRM felt that this unique circumstances that the appropriate mechanism was to bring this back as a dec(laratory) action to the Water Commission. That provides some additional background. We did receive written testimony, normally we take questions by the Commissioners before we take public testimony. Commissioner Aurora Kagawa-Viviani is not here, but she did have some questions. I'm going to read them into the record and permit staff an opportunity to address them. There’s no objections? The first comment relates to system source - assuming my interpretation is correct and I'm trying to read this verbatim from her email – “please clarify what the potable Kapalua public water system managed by Hawaii Water Service formally by MLP’s Kapalua Water Company is served solely by two wells, Kapalua 1 and 2, while Kapalua area non-potable needs are supported by Honokōhau Stream and Honolua Ditch. They are different systems. Note...”
Yes, that is correct. The potable system is served by the two wells. Kapalua 1 and 2, and the region's non-potable needs are serviced by the Honokōhau Stream and actually the Honokōhau Ditch. Yes, there are two - the groundwater and surface water systems are two separate systems.
“Two, expiration sunset. Can we be more precise about the sunset of this ruling? Does it sunset 7/23/2031 or 12/31/2031? Suggest revised recommendations to provide clarity.”
As we were drafting the submittal, that did come to mind. I think I would want to put that to the Commission and that may be revised depending on comments from TY Management and Hawaiʻi Water Service and others.
She didn't give me follow-up questions, so I'm just going to read her question. “Third, actions upon expirations seem internally inconsistent. Existing language suggests water use permit will be required to extend use past 2031; however, ambiguity is introduced in recommendation two with the indication that the ruling may be extended or modified in addition to a permit application for new use. Given the permit process will be ongoing, is it possible to provide more clarity about the steps HWS should pursue?”
That's probably my fault for not catching that in recommendation one. We did say that we will not require Hawaiʻi Water Service to obtain a water use permit until the year 2031 but wanting to provide some flexibility for the Commission at that time. I added in recommendation two that would give you folks options to, again, either extend this declaratory ruling, modify the ruling, or require Hawaiʻi Water Service or TY Management to file for a water use permit for new use or some other action you deem appropriate, either now or at that time.
When we get to the point of any amendments to the modification, she did have some additional language.
I just have a legal question for our attorney. HAR 13-167-81, which is the basis to it, seems to apply to absolutely everything we do.
I got to pull that up.
I'm sorry, what? 
I have to pull it up.
Okay but I was looking at the submittal where it quotes it. It applies to everything. If it applies, is there any limitation on our authority to bypass all these things? I mean if I look at that Hawaii Administrative Rule, you say we can issue a declaratory ruling on anything we do, so that seems crazy to me. Unless it's some limitation that we impose on ourselves, but I'm not comfortable with a law that lets us do that.
Well, as long as - and I've only sat on the Water Commission 18 months - this is the first time that we've used a dec(laratory) action. I think that we try to judiciously exercise that, that we don't use it unless sort of exhausting all other legal remedies. I suspect that that is part of the reason why the dec(laratory) action is provided. You got to exhaust everything else, but I think it does provide us great flexibility should we have no other vehicle.
It is very broad.
We can bypass the entire Code. Not only that, we can bypass findings of law and I mean all of that stuff.
Well I think you guys as the Commission wouldn't do that because...
I know we wouldn't do that, but it gives us the authority. DEPUTY AG CHINA: But it’s there, yeah.
What if we have a different Commission and they want to do anything?
That's why Julie is here.
I think we’d get sued, but there is some additional language to this. I don't know if anybody has that because I know we've only quoted...
Just looking at it, I was surprised that there isn't any checks and balances or limitation on it, but anyway that was just a legal question.
I think that is a fair question other than...
I don't have any problem.
Okay, very good.
Dean, can you just help me with this? You're saying that if all the existing reservations were exercised, we’d still have 5.3 million gallons of sustainable yield and you're saying that if we approve pending requests, we'll have 3.8? What is those pending 1.5 million gallons?
What is it for?
Yes, there are some permits in process, isn't there?
Sorry, what was that again?
Is there permits in process?
Yes, we're reviewing the existing use permits now and we're going to start working on the letters for Honolua.
Sort of as a background, what's the intent of these portable homes? Is it the intent to be removed after seven years?
Correct, that's my understanding, but Hawaiʻi Water Service and TY Management are here for additional questions or they can provide additional insight.
Okay, I'll wait for that. Thank you.
Just a quick question, you mentioned that the Kapalua water system is in effect a dual system for public purpose – one, for potable from the wells 1 and 2 and then it uses surface water as well and all homes served by the public utility have in effect two meters. Will these units have that second availability of non- potable water, surface water to them? Secondly, if not, does it make much sense to perhaps expand the permit from 400 to the usual 600 gallons per day because these are one, two, three, and four bedroom units. They might reach a situation in some of the larger units where they could use and should need more than 400 gallons per day. Just a question.
No, good enough and I think, Paul, the applicants are here who could probably answer more specifically your question.
Good morning, Chair and Commissioners, Commissioner Meyer, that are participating by Zoom. My name is Robert Strand, I'm an attorney representing TY Management Corporation and with me this morning is Onaona Thoene who's also representing TY Management Corporation in connection with the water in the Kapalua Village Project with the 50 homes for the displaced residents. There was one question, if I may address the first question, it is the intention of TY Management to remove the modular units after seven years. Again, if it turns out that the rebuilding of Lahaina takes longer, we would have to come back before the Commission and a lot of other both governmental and private entities and seek permission to extend that, but right now the intention is to remove them after seven years. As far as Mr. Meyer's question, there is not going to be a second meter for non-potable water. We don't anticipate there will be any need for substantial irrigation at the site and what the project is trying to do is to use as little water as is reasonably required. Commissioner Meyer is correct, there are two bedroom, three bedroom, and four bedroom homes, but we think with the check meters and the low flow appliances or I'm sorry, I should say...
Showers and toilets.
Showers and toilets and that we will be able to manage the water and conserve it in a way that would keep it within the 20,000 gallons per day. I certainly wouldn't object to an expansion to 600 gallons which is the County standard, but that is not the pending request before the Commission. I think those were the questions that were raised, but I'm open to any other questions that the Commissioners may have.
What’s the impact to your, is the golf course going to continue to be used? What impact does this use have on your golf course?
This land used to be part of what they call the Kapalua Village Course which has been out of operation for quite some time. They have the Plantation Course mauka and the Bay Course makai and in both of those courses they've implemented conservation measures for the irrigation water. At one time they used this property to grow sod and they were irrigating the sod and they would use it on the other golf courses, but obviously now that they're using it for housing there won't be any need for that irrigation water per se. They won't be growing sod on the, I think it's the first hole of the Kapalua Village Course, so there won't be any impact on the surface water that's being used for the golf courses.
And the 50 units are all for displaced employees?
Yes and the first priority would be for golf course employees. I understand and we have a bunch of folks available on Zoom if I misquote something, but at the last meeting we had, I think 25 of the units have been applied for by golf course employees. The next priority would be given to employees within the resort, could be the hotels or the other commercial properties there, and if there's still units remaining, they would be open to any displaced residents of Lahaina who needed temporary housing. They're going to fill these units with folks that need the housing.
I provided written testimony, would you like me to read it?
No, thank you. We've received it, you can summarize if you want.
I'm just one of the employees in need. I'm the golf course superintendent and my wife and I lost our home and we're just anxiously waiting to move in.
Thank you, I appreciate you joining us today. Sorry about your situation.
We're in the same situation as Brian. We lost our dog, my car, everything. We can't wait to move in here, we're very fortunate.
I appreciate you both joining us today, thank you.
Aloha, for the record my name is Elena Bryant testifying on behalf of Earthjustice. We want to emphasize that we absolutely support the immediate construction of temporary emergency housing for displaced Maui Komohana community members and commend TY Management Corporation for self-funding these housing units and supporting its community members in this way. Here, it appears based on the submittal and presentation that the requested use of 20,000 gpd (gallons per day) for 50 temporary modular housing units can be accommodated under the sustainable yield in light of other requested existing and new uses with little to no impact on the aquifer. But, we have concerns about setting a precedent of exempting uses from water use permitting requirements in designated water management areas without express and explicit terms governing that exempted use and we have questions and concerns similar to what Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani has raised. We urge the Commission to add language to the ruling, making it abundantly clear that this use is being exempted from water use permitting requirements under the unique and extenuating circumstances involved here. We would urge the Commission to also include language in its ruling, making it clear that the requested use shall only be used for temporary housing of displaced Maui Komohana community members, that approval of this use will cease if and when the temporary housing units are no longer being used to support community members, and that the 20,000 gpd cannot be used for or converted to any other purpose without going through the water use permitting process and of course any other sunsetting provision clarifications that would aid future Commissioners and the public in understanding the terms of this use. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'd just like to speak to this, we're having a crisis in trying to create some units for people to go because they have to move out of hotels. I greatly respect the process that the Commission follows to make sure all the t's are crossed and i’s are dotted, but in this case this is an area that is one of the few aquifers that is not being over pumped, where the wells have had very, very stable chlorides. I wrote a history of Maui’s water back in 2004 and suggested in that that the County should take over these wells because they appear to be unpolluted and have low chlorides. That being said, I think it's a good idea to look for opportunities where water can be provided to affordable units that are going to be kept affordable either temporary time to cover the need or longer term. There is another project I noticed in the presentation that was made to the department in June or made by CWRM in June that there was a map showing projects that were considered ready to go. One of these is Pūlelehua which I also and many others have tracked for years. This is a promised development that's supposed to deliver affordable housing, the housing is going to be affordable for 30 years which most housing in our County is not. Many people have been counting on this project for years and years but they too have no source of water except from Maui Land and Pine who pledged that they could use water either from Honokōhau, which now seems less probable because that water is really overcommitted or from some other Maui Land and Pine source which would be the Kapalua wells. Their need is 75,000 gallons, so I think that it is good to look at the big picture, but in Honolua aquifer if there are a few exceptions that could help get people in housing. This would help 50 people. Pūlelehua, first phase, would help I think 140 people. These are rentals so people don't have to wait in line to buy houses, they can just have a place, a roof over their head at an affordable rate. I just urge you to also be practical as well as upholding your public trust responsibilities and I am preparing a letter on behalf of Maui Tomorrow to go into more detail on this and it'll be submitted in the next few days. This is a difficult decision, but I think that we have people hurting out there in West Maui who are being forced out of the hotels and who really want a roof over their heads and they do need some water. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Lucienne. Anyone else? I will share with you that as Chair of the Water Commission, working with CWRM staff and the Attorney General's office, we have struggled with how do we address Maui temp housing, how do we address the Maui housing crisis, and trying to very narrowly tailor where it does not fall on the Emergency Proclamation because we did not want to seek a suspension of 174C, but utilizing the existing code. We felt comfortable under 174C-48 that the County can redistribute and not be a new use, but as we're going through the water use management process, having to be very cautious about being transparent, fair, and objective, but also recognizing the unique circumstances of the displaced Maui residence. I think based upon those circumstances, we felt that the declaratory action was an appropriate action in this case as it permitted the Commission to take action in the context of a public meeting and so that we could do this in open. Again, we are trying to very narrowly tailor it - be on a case-by-case basis. As I think both Commissioner Miike and I have said, this is the first time I've seen us use a declaratory ruling and although as broad as it is, we are trying to be very cautious about how we implement the Water Code in light of these circumstances.
Just dealing with the comments from the Earthjustice attorney, it seems like the submittal has everything in there except a more formal statement about the housing to be used only for displaced people from the fire. I think that it already said that, maybe we can incorporate that into the recommendation. You wouldn't have any problem with that?
No, that's certainly the intent and in the priorities we mentioned, we're going to fill them all with displaced West Maui residents.
I know Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani did provide - I don't know how different - she just says she would modify the recommendations: 1) “The Commission on Water Resource Management will not require Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. to obtain a water use permit under 174C-48a for the delivery of up to 20,000 gallons a day of groundwater to its customer TY Management Corporation, TMK for 50 temporary modular housing units of the Kapalua Village Temporary Housing Project for Kapalua employees who have been displaced by the Lahaina fire until the year 2031.” That's what it says. Okay, I don't...
Her point is that just a little bit of inconsistency between, we're saying that if you read Recommendation 1, it appears that they would need to obtain a water use permit after 2031. Recommendation 2 gives you folks options to either extend the ruling, modify it, or require filing of water use permit application for new use.
She's recommending, “may include an extension of the ruling, modification...required filing of a water use permit application for new use or other action as determined by the Commission." She was just bringing out the inconsistency? Do you have a recommendation?
I agree with her recommendation of first setting an expiration or sunset date, defining that whether you want to go with seven years from today or end of 2031. That may be the first step.
Is there a preference?
Well, I suppose we'd like December 31, 2031. 
What’s a few months?
There’s just so much uncertainty as to how quickly Lahaina is going to rebuild and I did see in the newspaper last week that there’s at least one house that had a permit. That fella is rebuilding, but it's going to be a very slow process.
Are we adding or keeping that about we still have the option of extending it?
I think that's on recommendation number two, right?
Are you making any changes?
I support this water use, but I guess the question in Recommendation 2, the last sentence is that is there a potential of this morphing into permanent housing? I would expect that we would have the ability if the need for temporary housing extends beyond the estimated seven years, that it'll be okay. The issue would be really is that if this morphs into permanent housing. It's like having temporary buildings on the university campus. There's nothing more permanent than a temporary building.
If we need to clarify that...we should probably be having a motion then discussion. The representation has been only for temp housing.
Are you ready for a motion?
Yeah, I think we should procedurally have a motion and then have discussion and then we can do the amendments. Go ahead.
I make a motion to take the staff’s recommendation 1 with the amendment that the temporary modular housing for the Kapalua Village Temporary Housing Project not be limited to the golf course employees, but to the displaced residents of Lahaina as a result of the Lahaina fires and this temporary modular housing will cease on December 31, 2031.
And then Condition 2, are you making any changes?
Chair, can we be more specific on the last sentence on the options for continued use of water where it says that “for new uses”.
Okay, how would you like to?
I'm not sure on what pathways forward that if the applicant applies for a new water permit, would that now become permanent zoning or permanent housing? My understanding is any permanent use is going to require new water use permit.
I mean this is only because it's temporary and that the intention is that they will get offline.
Should that action be independent of this approval? In other words, do we need to narrow this extended use only for emergency use for temporary housing? That could go on for years beyond the seven years.
I think that goes to Elena’s comment about making it a little more clear that...
I agree with that. I would support that, Elena's comment.
Can I have a comment on Kathy's motion? It sort of leaves it open that anybody could apply for displaced and their priority is their employees. Then if there's extra...
I guess we should prioritize it with golf course employees, then hotel employees...
Other resort employees, it could be commercial properties and then if there's still units left over, they will provide them to other displaced residents in West Maui. That would be the three levels of priority.
I would incorporate those three priorities.
If I may, I can put up a Word document and we can edit that?
“Options for continued use are limited only for Maui temp housing, but may include an extension.” Is that the language that we're looking at for number 2? So, there are three priorities in number 1 – 1) displaced golf course employees, 2) displaced hotel resort employees, and 3) fire displaced Maui residents.
I think that language is, I don't know, the only thing I prioritized for 1) Kapalua employees, 2) other Kapalua employee residents, and 3) West Maui residents who have been displaced.
I think that's the intention and I think the language that Dean came up with works with those changes, works.
“And for fire displaced West Maui residents,” because we don't have fire...
It says, “who have been displaced by the Lahaina fire.” 
Sorry, you guys are one sentence ahead of me.
Move the last, the date?
And we're going to move it to December 31, 2031. Then number 2, if we could where it says, “Options for continued use of water shall be limited to temporary housing and may include an extension of this ruling,” so that we do include that limitation, “it should only be used,” “but shall be limited to temporary housing for displaced Maui residents and may include...” Is that satisfactory? Applicant seems to be okay. Commissioners? Paul and Wayne?
I’m okay, thank you.
Can I clarify? Sorry, it says “shall notify,” so we're okay with them just writing us a letter notifying us of the change?
I think we would have to notify you and then get another approval.
I would think that's the case, but I want to be clear that that's what we're intending.
And we have other approvals we need get from the County and from the Kapalua Resort Association and other entities and hopefully, we’ll know well in advance if we'll be able to.
It says, “may include an extension of this ruling...modification of this ruling,” so it...
Where do you see “shall notify”?
It says right there, “shall notify.” They'll notify us and then further down it says, “may include an extension modification of this ruling, required filing...”
One requires them to notify us and then it requires a ruling by the Commission.
We have one more from Earthjustice.
They already testified?
Just commenting on what you guys said just now.
You guys have already received their testimony.
I think we've tried to incorporate her comment. Sorry, Elena, we tried to incorporate your comment as best we could.
The Commission on Water Resource Management will not require Hawaii Water
Service Company, Inc. to obtain a water use permit under Hawaii Revised Statutes section 174C-48(a) for the delivery of up to 20,000 gallons a day of ground water to its customer TY Management Corporation on TMK parcel (2) 4-2-004:036 for 50 temporary modular housing units of the Kapalua Village Temporary Housing Project, until December 31, 2031, prioritized for: 1) Kapalua Golf employees; 2) other Kapalua Resort employees; and 3) Other West Maui residents, who have been displaced by the Lahaina fire.
Should the use of water to the Kapalua Village Temporary Housing Project extend beyond the expiration date of this declaratory ruling or if there are changes to its water use requirements, Hawaii Water Service and/or its customer TY Management Corporation shall notify the Commission on Water Resource Management. Options for continued use of water shall be limited to temporary housing for displaced Maui residents and may include an extension of this ruling, modification of this ruling, required filing of a water use permit application for new use, or other action as determined by the Commission.
