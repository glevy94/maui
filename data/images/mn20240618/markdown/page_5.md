**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** Not quite how I read it, but I'm not a lawyer. The second question I had was around recommendation one. Ota Well was just on our radar, so I was going back and recalling that there were eight alternative actions for Keauhou non-designation and the first of those was, “the Commission will refer all well permit applications to ‘Aha Moku.” There's a clearly delineated process and so how would this proposed recommendation - I mean it doesn't seem to address that there are specific, close-to-designation areas that may be important for us to consider or for there to be a public process on. One, because it's already established that for Keauhou, there is a need to address the well construction or it says, “all permits.” How are we folding that in? I was going to suggest an amendment there, but how are you considering the regional specifics?

**RYAN IMATA:** That's a good question. Here is the thing about Keauhou, and I can't tell you the answer to this, but I think there have been some statements, specific to Ota Well, that there was nothing in the eight requirements that required us to bring it to the Commission. But in my recommendation, I think where the Chair feels that there are things that the Chair wants to make sure that there's public disclosure on and the opportunity for public input on, we can take it to the Commission. Basically, what I'm proposing is not saying that everything blanket, gets delegated to the Chair. There are opportunities and I think Keauhou is one of them where the Chair can take the approval of the well permit and/or the pump permit to the Commission. Again, it's just very specific to the area, but like I said, I think most of the concerns related to the quantity of water and the potential for threats are first covered by the fact that most of those areas are designated Water Management Areas, so all of those are going to come to the Commission anyway.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** Sorry, what I was referring to was places that are maybe near to designation or not designated. Just for the record I'll refer to February 14, 2017 - eight criteria were proposed as following actions as alternatives to designation. “The Commission will refer all permit applications to the ‘Aha Moku system for review and recommendations to protect traditional and customary practices that are exercised and may be affected by the proposed application. If traditional and customary practices are found in the proposed permit area that may be affected by the proposed action, special conditions will be suggested to mitigate the impact of proposal. If the well operator and land owner do not agree, then the staff will present applications to the Commission for decision making pursuant to HRS 174C-84(f) and HAR §13-168-12(h).” I guess I just want to understand if we decide this, how do these two sort of decisions - just like some address that there are certain areas that we will need to have more discretion on and not leave it up to the Chair who comes and goes and may or may not know about certain hotspots.

**RYAN IMATA:** I do see what you're saying in terms of, does this delegation supersede that. We can maybe add in some language in there to say that this doesn't supersede areas.
