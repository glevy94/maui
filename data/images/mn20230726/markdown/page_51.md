In the drinking water for their children -- can interact and ask questions and get information about the water. So those are just some of the efforts that we're doing to continue to show the water is safe and to also basically hold to our commitment that we were going to continue to sample the water.

In addition to all of the efforts we're doing here, we continue to pursue sampling at the Navy Aiea HƒÅlawa Shaft. It is our current shaft that is offline; it's been offline since December 3rd of 2021; however, we felt it was important to build data history for that location. And so starting in September of 2022, we began doing every two to three weeks a flushing to over land for about 15 to 20 minutes for the purpose of collecting samples from that location to build data history so that we could see what the water quality is like in that location for future discussions with our regulators about reuse of that location.

So that's just some of the things we're doing in regards to our drinking water, and Captain Sullivan will share more about our remediation efforts and other environmental --

CAPTAIN SULLIVAN: And if I could also, on this same topic that we do have -- as Sarah mentioned, all of the testing going on, we also have a rapid response team that is available. If any resident has a concern about their water quality, if they're seeing anything unusual, they can call.
