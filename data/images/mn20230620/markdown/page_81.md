don't think that that -- I mean, it could be -- the data that we're collecting from this deep monitor well could certainly be used by whoever is preparing the model in estimating groundwater flow, but in and of itself, I don't know that -- that we -- that that provides us enough data to really make a defining statement on groundwater flow patterns. Because, again, you'll see the proximity of this well to the fuels tank facility, and you see the location of Halawa Shaft, it's far enough away that it -- it really is just a theory right now that would be validated once the model gets created and -- and if it's -- if our data can be used as an input parameter to the model, that's a good thing. Right? But I -- I'm not a modeler, I don't understand that component of it, so, again, I -- I think that perhaps our theory may be validated by whatever the model tells us, but I'm not sure that we can really make any definitive statement about it. I hope that made sense.

COMMISSIONER [SETO] KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Yeah, quick question. Oh, I'm sorry.

COMMISSIONER BUCK: No, go ahead.

COMMISSIONER [SETO] KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Question, Ryan. So we -- you're groundwater, and you focus on --

MR. IMATA: Yep.

COMMISSIONER [SETO] KAGAWA-VIVIANI: -- sort of what you can measure
