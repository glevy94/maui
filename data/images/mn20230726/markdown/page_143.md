will -- focusing the implementation of it within these priority watersheds that feed into the bay, and this -- this catalyst project, we've identified various different actions to achieve and carry out the catalyst project. Many of these actions have actually been previously identified by the Moanalua Watershed Hui, which is essentially a collective of community groups that are working to improve the quality of the bay.

So I wanted to highlight, as you can see from that last map, these actions are both located in both mauka and makai areas. For example, in the Wailupe Watershed, we've identified the Wailupe Watershed stream restoration as one of the key actions. In the Niu Watershed in the upper watershed, we've identified watershed fencing, mid -- the middle watershed invasive species removal and native out-planting, and then in the lower watershed, the invasive algae removal, which is being carried out by Malama Maunalua.

Kuli‘ou‘ou, we identified ongoing fishpond restoration as well as watershed retention and infiltration in the upper watershed. In Haha‘ione, we've identified wetland and heiau restoration, which is currently being carried out. And lastly, in the Kamilo Nui and Kamilo Iki, identified a range of actions, including reforestation.
