So that concludes my presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions that you guys have or -- I think I see Commissioner Seto smiling, so I'll deflect some questions to her too, but -- okay, thank you.

CHAIR CHANG: So, Mike.

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Yeah, Ryan, thanks a lot. I know the monitoring wells are critical, especially the ones in the west, to get a much better idea of what's in the aquifer and the plume flow. And I know we've got some issues with liability and trying to put the appropriate monitoring wells in, but let's say we put them in there -- and again, the -- the commission's kuleana is really gonna be long-term aquifer remediation and recovery. What kind of time frame -- assuming we get the wells in -- did you project before we could start making some determinations kind of the plume? And I know theoretical, we don't know, but this is an issue that is gonna be with the commission for quite a while. Do you have any -- any projections of time frames once the monitoring wells are in for us to begin to draw some -- some kind of rational, you know, observations?

MR. IMATA: Yeah, and I don't want to misspeak, and Joanna's certainly here to correct me if I say anything wrong or -- or even expand on what I might say. But I know that initially -- was it at an FTAC, a Fuel Tank Advisory Committee meeting, Joanna, that I think either EPA or DOH presented
