It'sD.: And today i'm going to just give you a brief overview of how we got to this point with the PDK what we're doing now currently and where we're headed and before I really get into the guts of the.,719.76,731.76
"(733.02, 752.84)"," Dr. David Art, M.D.: project, I want to kind of frame this in a jamming in this this idea of the data lifecycle and the data lifecycle is kind of a comprehensive idea of how we understand and look at data and all the many parts of it.",733.02,752.84
"(752.84, 757.04)"," So we have data monitoring, which is basically measuring data in the field.",752.84,757.04
"(757.24, 760.04)"," We're talking temperature, rainfall, all of these different elements.",757.24,760.04
"(760.44, 769.0)"," Folks, I think, are familiar with the Hawaii Mesonet, which is being installed right now with over up to 100 climate stations across Hawaii, led by the Water Resource Research Center and Tom Giambalucca.",760.44,769.0
"(769.0, 777.0)"," Then there's data processing. We get the data. What do we do with it? We have to make sure it's homogenous, that it's we're able to get rid of outliers.",769.0,777.0
"(777.0, 789.52)"," Combined data sets is a huge step to that. Then there's data storage, so where do you keep data so it's safe that you can access it, and then there's data access, meaning how does the general public or people that need it actually",777.0,789.52
"(789.52, 794.16)"," access it. So you need to put a lot of investment into that. Then there's data analysis, so you have",789.52,794.16
"(794.16, 797.28)"," the data now, what do you do with it, how do you detect those trends, how do you do,",794.16,797.28
"(798.8, 801.84)"," you know, find the information that you're looking for in a cohesive manner.",798.8,801.84
"(803.12, 805.74)"," Then there's data products, so once you get to those conclusions,",803.12,805.74
"(805.74, 806.94)", how do you create the products,805.74,806.94
"(806.94, 811.22)", that can show these findings in a way that's digestible,806.94,811.22
"(811.22, 814.74)", by the general public or by anyone for that matter?,811.22,814.74
"(814.74, 817.32)"," And then finally, a big part of this data life cycle",814.74,817.32
"(817.32, 819.56)", and something that my research has moved into considerably,817.32,819.56
"(819.56, 822.28)", over the last couple of years is data dissemination.,819.56,822.28
"(822.28, 824.86)"," So once you have these data products, excuse me,",822.28,824.86
"(826.82, 830.8)"," how do you get them out to the people that need them the most, right? So this is the data",826.82,830.8
"(830.8, 835.18)", life cycle and the project I'm talking about today is kind of encompassing a lot of these,830.8,835.18
"(835.18, 842.8)"," elements. Next slide, please. So how did we get here? Well, some anecdotal evidence over",835.18,842.8
"(842.8, 846.62)", the last couple years has shown us that drought is increasing in Hawaii.,842.8,846.62
"(846.62, 852.34)"," This recent study by Dr. Abby Fraser has showed us that drought frequency is increasing, drought",846.62,852.34
"(852.34, 858.0)"," duration, how long droughts are lasting, and the drought magnitude, how severe the droughts",852.34,858.0
"(858.0, 859.0)", are.,858.0,859.0
"(859.0, 862.14)"," So, this is on a decadal time scale, and we did this analysis a few years ago, and then",859.0,862.14
"(862.14, 865.6)", we updated it recently and just published this paper in the Journal of Sustainability.,862.14,865.6
"(865.92, 869.04)", And it shows us that we are seeing these trends towards a drier,865.92,869.04
"(870.08, 873.72)", climate and more frequent and longer lasting and more powerful droughts.,870.08,873.72
"(875.12, 878.16)", We also had some earlier work before the project launched,875.12,878.16
"(878.64, 883.24)", where the Forest Service put out this technical report on managing the effects of drought in Hawaii,878.64,883.24
"(883.52, 885.34)", and the US-aff US affiliate Pacific Islands.,883.52,885.34
"(885.34, 886.8)", It was a great project.,885.34,886.8
"(886.8, 887.84)"," They looked at drought,",886.8,887.84
"(887.84, 890.26)"," how resource managers were looking,",887.84,890.26
"(890.26, 892.3)"," managing drought in different sectors,",890.26,892.3
"(892.3, 894.0)", but there were some gaps in it.,892.3,894.0
"(894.0, 897.44)", There was also this kind of need for resource managers,894.0,897.44
"(897.44, 899.58)", to be more involved in the process.,897.44,899.58
"(899.58, 903.02)"," Data was identified as hard to get, not easily,",899.58,903.02
"(904.52, 906.8)"," not just get access, but how to analyze it",904.52,906.8
"(906.8, 910.72)", there really was no kind of central clearinghouse of data and there really were no formal,906.8,910.72
"(910.72, 914.64)", communication mechanisms between the research community and the managers on the ground,910.72,914.64
"(915.28, 921.04)", so this uh prompted this idea of a drought knowledge exchange so funding from the pacific,915.28,921.04
"(921.04, 927.96)", islands climate adaptation science center we started started this project to create a knowledge exchange here in Hawaii.,921.04,927.96
"(928.24, 930.72)", And it's based on these four principles.,928.24,930.72
"(930.96, 934.52)", The first one is to kind of provide resource managers with sector specific,930.96,934.52
"(934.72, 939.64)"," or sorry, sector and site specific information about their individual land areas.",934.72,939.64
"(939.64, 942.72)"," So instead of like looking at one map and finding your place on the map,",939.64,942.72
"(943.08, 949.2)", pulling that information out for those individual geographies improved technical assistance so helping resource managers,943.08,949.2
"(949.2, 955.52)", access data that they may not either have the capability to or the time to to access it the,949.2,955.52
"(955.52, 960.0)", third one is to better more comprehensive information so leveraging our knowledge on data,955.52,960.0
"(960.0, 965.28)", and providing more data that may not have been managers may not have been aware of and then a,960.0,965.28
"(965.28, 970.0)", more collaborative transfer information environment we call this co-production and this is a key,965.28,970.0
"(970.0, 974.4)", element of the PDKE and really all of the work that I do now and I'm going to have a slide here,970.0,974.4
"(974.4, 980.72)", just to show you the what this means so a typical information transfer model we have the what I,974.4,980.72
"(980.72, 986.72)", call the ivory tower approach this is when a bunch of scientists get together and they create some type of product,980.72,986.72
"(986.72, 988.4)", and they launch it off the tower,986.72,988.4
"(988.4, 991.26)", and they hope that it lands in some decision-makers hands,988.4,991.26
"(991.26, 993.04)"," and they hope that it's used,",991.26,993.04
"(993.04, 995.02)", but we don't know that's really gonna happen.,993.04,995.02
"(995.02, 996.78)"," You know, it's just kind of brushing your fingers",995.02,996.78
"(996.78, 998.9)", and hoping they move on to the next things.,996.78,998.9
"(998.9, 1001.12)", The other type of model is the loading dock approach,998.9,1001.12
"(1001.12, 1004.5)", where maybe the research manager or the scientist is tasked,1001.12,1004.5
"(1004.5, 1010.48)"," with a particular idea of, okay, do this create this product they create it they back it up and",1004.5,1010.48
"(1010.48, 1016.24)", they um they drop it off to the to the stakeholder and they pull away and they hope that it's useful,1010.48,1016.24
"(1016.24, 1020.56)", right so these are the kind of typically what what gets done in this academic environment,1016.24,1020.56
"(1020.56, 1028.0)", um but we call this a one-way transfer of. What we're doing here is a coproduction model.,1020.56,1028.0
"(1028.0, 1033.0)", This is when the researcher and the decision maker are in conversations from the very beginning.,1028.0,1033.0
"(1033.0, 1039.0)"," And for the PDK project, we kind of actually had some of the decision makers write the proposal with us.",1033.0,1039.0
"(1039.0, 1046.44)", So we work together and then there's a back and forth exchange and the products that are created are then relevant,1039.0,1046.44
"(1046.44, 1048.32)", to the actual decision maker,1046.44,1048.32
"(1048.32, 1050.8)", because they had their input from the very beginning.,1048.32,1050.8
"(1050.8, 1053.14)", And we call this a two-way information transfer,1050.8,1053.14
"(1053.14, 1054.76)", and a co-production model.,1053.14,1054.76
"(1054.76, 1058.08)", And this means that really the scientists,1054.76,1058.08
"(1058.08, 1061.74)", are actively getting feedback as the process continues.,1058.08,1061.74
"(1061.74, 1063.32)"," Next slide, please.",1061.74,1063.32
"(1063.32, 1065.76)"," So we piloted this with three partners in Hawaii,",1063.32,1065.76
"(1066.72, 1072.72)"," Monica Kahalawai on Maui, Pua Vava and the Hawaii Volcanoes on the Big Island.",1066.72,1072.72
"(1072.72, 1079.84)"," And again, the project was funded by the podcast. And we basically met with these",1072.72,1079.84
"(1081.68, 1086.4)", folks early on in the project. We had some stakeholder consultations with them.,1081.68,1086.4
"(1086.4, 1089.9)"," November 19, we went to the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.",1086.4,1089.9
"(1089.9, 1092.48)"," We went to Pu'u Wa'awa in February,",1089.9,1092.48
"(1092.48, 1095.8)", and then everybody knows what happened in March of 2020.,1092.48,1095.8
"(1095.8, 1099.36)"," We moved to this virtual environment with Mauna Kahala Wai,",1095.8,1099.36
"(1099.36, 1102.68)"," and we had less success with them in the project,",1099.36,1102.68
"(1102.68, 1103.9)", I think maybe because we didn't get,1102.68,1103.9
"(1103.9, 1106.56)"," the initial stakeholder consultation off the ground,",1103.9,1106.56
"(1106.56, 1109.24)", but overall the project was a huge success.,1106.56,1109.24
"(1109.24, 1111.16)", We had a couple of products come out of it.,1109.24,1111.16
"(1111.16, 1114.6)", One of our crown jewels is our CCBD portfolio.,1111.16,1114.6
"(1114.6, 1116.72)", This is a site-specific climate portfolio,1114.6,1116.72
"(1116.72, 1118.56)", for an individual geography.,1116.72,1118.56
"(1118.56, 1121.1)", It contains information about climate.,1118.56,1121.1
"(1122.42, 1124.04)", It's about 35 pages.,1122.42,1124.04
"(1124.04, 1126.66)", It's an automated thing where we go in and we get all of the,1124.04,1126.66
"(1126.66, 1133.64)"," gridded products available, rainfall, temperature, climate, relative humidity, land cover, anything",1126.66,1133.64
"(1133.64, 1138.34)"," that's gridded for the state. And then we put in a shapefile or basically a geographic domain,",1133.64,1138.34
"(1138.72, 1142.86)"," and we pull out all of that information for that individual file. So for example, here,",1138.72,1142.86
"(1142.92, 1145.96)"," Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, we're getting all the information",1142.92,1145.96
"(1145.96, 1147.52)", for just the park boundaries.,1145.96,1147.52
"(1147.52, 1150.32)"," We do this for watersheds, we can do this for,",1147.52,1150.32
"(1150.32, 1152.46)"," you know, forest reserves.",1150.32,1152.46
"(1152.46, 1154.02)", We could do this for elementary schools.,1152.46,1154.02
"(1154.02, 1155.7)", We could do this for anywhere in the state.,1154.02,1155.7
"(1155.7, 1157.98)", We've made about over a hundred of these portfolios,1155.7,1157.98
"(1157.98, 1159.28)", for folks so far.,1157.98,1159.28
"(1159.28, 1160.72)", They contain a bunch of information,1159.28,1160.72
"(1160.72, 1162.38)", like climate characteristics.,1160.72,1162.38
"(1162.38, 1165.44)", They have monthly rainfall rainfall temperature trend variability,1162.38,1165.44
"(1165.44, 1169.68)", ecological stuff we have the future climate projections of rainfall and temperature,1165.44,1169.68
"(1169.68, 1175.44)", historical drought time series and data and then we even have some analyses and summaries we have,1169.68,1175.44
"(1175.44, 1180.4)", a paragraph that you can cut out of the portfolio and put right into your proposal if you wanted to,1175.44,1180.4
"(1180.4, 1185.0)"," describe what's going on with your individual geography. Next slide, please.",1180.4,1185.0
"(1185.0, 1187.76)", We've also created these plain language fact sheets for all,1185.0,1187.76
"(1187.76, 1190.44)", both of our stakeholders in the pilot project.,1187.76,1190.44
"(1190.72, 1194.2)"," We have plain language information about El Nino, future climates,",1190.72,1194.2
"(1194.2, 1198.68)"," historical drought, fire risk, and these were created also in the co-production model.",1194.2,1198.68
"(1198.88, 1201.44)"," And in particularly like Hawaii Volcanoes National Park,",1198.88,1201.44
"(1201.44, 1203.56)", they wanted fact sheets to give to their employees,1201.44,1203.56
"(1203.84, 1205.6)", and they didn't want them to be gloom and doom.,1203.84,1205.6
"(1205.6, 1207.08)"," They wanted them to be empowering,",1205.6,1207.08
"(1207.08, 1208.48)"," teach them about natural resources,",1207.08,1208.48
"(1208.48, 1210.22)"," about climate and weather,",1208.48,1210.22
"(1210.22, 1212.4)", and have them feel like they can be empowered,1210.22,1212.4
"(1212.4, 1216.16)", to make resource management decisions to protect the park.,1212.4,1216.16
"(1216.16, 1218.22)", Pula Va Va works with a lot of community groups.,1216.16,1218.22
"(1218.22, 1221.1)", They wanted their fact sheets very plain language.,1218.22,1221.1
"(1221.1, 1222.76)", They wanted the community to be able to connect,1221.1,1222.76
"(1222.76, 1225.12)", with the science and the um the,1222.76,1225.12
"(1225.12, 1230.24)", data that is associated with this particular area so the fact sheets were a pretty big success as,1225.12,1230.24
"(1230.24, 1236.16)", well we also did a drought needs assessment um where you know a master's student melissa coons,1230.24,1236.16
"(1236.96, 1241.2)", basically went around and interviewed folks across the state and she also created a few fact sheets,1236.96,1241.2
"(1241.2, 1245.52)", and she created this drought needs assessment we had Dr. Katie Kamelamela,1241.2,1245.52
"(1245.52, 1252.96)", provide information on um on indigenous drought knowledge assessments and we are preparing this,1245.52,1252.96
"(1252.96, 1257.76)", into a formal report which we'll be publishing uh this summer as soon as things kind of die down,1252.96,1257.76
"(1257.76, 1263.84)", from the from the semester we also ran a adaptation planning and practice course an eight-week course,1257.76,1263.84
"(1263.84, 1268.16)", here in Hawaii with about 40 different participants from different organizations.,1263.84,1268.16
"(1268.16, 1276.08)"," The project was based on teaching folks how to go through this workbook process of how to adapt to climate change under different,",1268.16,1276.08
"(1276.08, 1281.32)", with a different kind of scenarios and different options on how they best want to manage their land.,1276.08,1281.32
"(1281.32, 1287.76)"," It was put on by the, by NIACS, which is a federal agency on the mainland.",1281.32,1287.76
"(1288.88, 1293.92)"," We have published this also this workshop in BAMS, which is a high scientific journal,",1288.88,1293.92
"(1294.64, 1298.48)", high level kind of plain language journal. And that was kind of a big accomplishment for the,1294.64,1298.48
"(1298.48, 1308.34)"," project and for to get Hawaii in this example, put up on this national stage. Next slide, please. We also translated the fact sheets into a little Hawaii.",1298.48,1308.34
"(1308.34, 1311.26)"," Alyssa, Dr. Alyssa Anderson did the translations",1308.34,1311.26
"(1311.26, 1313.92)", and these are also been well-received by the community.,1311.26,1313.92
"(1313.92, 1317.3)"," She translated all 10 fact sheets on a really,",1313.92,1317.3

"(1336.48, 1341.28)", UH and Dr. Christian Giardina at the U.S. Forest Service and Dr. Alyssa Anderson and then these,1336.48,1341.28
"(1341.28, 1345.52)", technical folks who are supporting a lot of the projects as well.,1341.28,1345.52
"(1349.12, 1349.68)"," Well, first project we're working on is the Hawaii Rangeland Information Portal.",1349.12,1349.68
"(1354.88, 1359.52)"," This is a decision support tool for ranchers. It helps ranchers effectively manage their drought by getting easy access to data and planning for drought by, you know, getting information about,",1354.88,1359.52
"(1360.08, 1364.0)"," you know, forage production and trying to just understand their geography and their climate",1360.08,1364.0
"(1364.0, 1368.8)", better. So this is the portal. We're going to launch it in the fall at the hawaii cattlemen's,1364.0,1368.8
"(1368.8, 1373.12)", council meeting but basically a real snapshot of this is you pick an individual geography,1368.8,1373.12
"(1373.68, 1379.36)", you can get a three-month projection of what rainfall and forage production is going to be like,1373.68,1379.36
"(1379.36, 1384.8)", based on el nino what's going on in the current um in the atmosphere and what has happened in the,1379.36,1384.8
"(1384.8, 1385.2)"," past so it's an almanac perspective it doesn't say use something fancy to tell, what's going on in the current in the atmosphere and what has happened in the past.",1384.8,1385.2
"(1385.2, 1389.36)", So it's an almanac perspective. It doesn't say use something fancy to tell you what's going to,1385.2,1389.36
"(1389.36, 1393.52)", happen in the future. It says this is what happened in the past during a strong El Nino.,1389.36,1393.52
"(1393.52, 1397.52)", This is what we expect in the future. You can enter in information about how many cattle you're,1393.52,1397.52
"(1397.52, 1402.72)"," managing, what kind of grass you have, and you can get an output of what your site's going to look",1397.52,1402.72
"(1402.72, 1409.84)"," like, how many grazing days you're expected to have. The portal also has a bunch of other information about site-specific stuff. And",1402.72,1409.84
"(1409.84, 1417.68)"," one thing we're working on now is a dashboard for folks in the field to, or actually anybody,",1409.84,1417.68
"(1417.68, 1424.32)"," ranchers, agricultural producers, anybody that wants easy to read, simple climate information",1417.68,1424.32

"(1437.58, 1447.32)"," We also have temperature. What was yesterday's temperature? Is the temperature warmer than it usually is? What's the minimum? What's the maximum? We have a 12 month drought outlook here, right?",1437.58,1447.32
"(1447.32, 1449.0)"," There's no, this is a fancy metric,",1447.32,1449.0
"(1449.0, 1450.12)", but we got rid of all that.,1449.0,1450.12
"(1450.12, 1452.04)", Is it drought or is it no drought?,1450.12,1452.04
"(1452.04, 1454.04)", And how many months are we in drought?,1452.04,1454.04
"(1454.04, 1456.68)"," And then finally, we have our information about El Nino.",1454.04,1456.68
"(1456.68, 1459.08)", What did we expect here for this particular month?,1456.68,1459.08
"(1459.08, 1460.6)", What's the historical average?,1459.08,1460.6
"(1460.6, 1462.56)", What's the wet La Nina average?,1460.6,1462.56
"(1462.56, 1464.48)", And what's the wet La Nina minimum?,1462.56,1464.48
"(1464.48, 1473.0)", So we're providing folks not only just just the average but what what what could potentially happen and this is still in development we're working on ways to make it intuitive.,1464.48,1473.0
"(1473.0, 1486.16)", We have some stakeholder consultation with ranchers coming up in June where we're going to sit down with them and really figure out how to make this work in a way that's meaningful to them. Also upgrading our CCVD portfolios.,1473.0,1486.16
"(1486.16, 1488.56)"," Like I said, we've made about a hundred of these,",1486.16,1488.56

"(1490.52, 1492.4)"," for everybody across the state that you can imagine,",1490.52,1492.4
"(1492.4, 1494.08)"," but there's still much more to do,",1492.4,1494.08
"(1494.08, 1496.24)"," but we've added about five or 10 new slides,",1494.08,1496.24

"(1503.24, 1515.0)"," We're actually pulling Ahupua our poor information and providing that to to folks to let them know the names, the Hawaiian names of their hope, who are that their geography is listed in there might be several of them and providing",1503.24,1515.0

"(1518.0, 1529.44)"," The third project, which is not so relevant maybe here but we are scaling up some work in the US. We're making some rainfall maps for Guam. We are also creating fact sheets for Guam.",1518.0,1529.44
"(1529.44, 1532.88)", We have a proposal in right now to do some work in American Samoa as well.,1529.44,1532.88
"(1533.52, 1538.8)"," And the fourth project, we are scaling up the PDKE in Hawaii. We are working with some additional",1533.52,1538.8
"(1538.8, 1542.72)"," partners. It took us a while to kind of mobilize this funding, but we are going to be doing the",1538.8,1542.72
"(1542.72, 1547.52)", same things that we were doing with Pula Vava and hawaii volcanoes national park with other partners that we've,1542.72,1547.52
"(1547.52, 1554.0)", identified so where are we headed now with this um aside from all the things we're currently working,1547.52,1554.0
"(1554.0, 1559.6)", on one of the main things is linking things to the http or the hawaii climate data portal i could,1554.0,1559.6
"(1559.6, 1570.32)", give a whole nother talk on this and i told myself i wasn't going to but uh the hawaii climate data portal is uh recently it's recently come online as a state-of-the-art tool to capture all of the near,1559.6,1570.32
"(1570.32, 1575.52)", real-time data in hawaii feed it into the portal and create gridded products that are at a near,1570.32,1575.52
"(1575.52, 1579.76)", real-time basis so right now we have monthly rainfall available but we're going to have daily,1575.52,1579.76
"(1579.76, 1584.4)", rainfall available we have daily temperature we have other things coming online vegetation,1579.76,1584.4
"(1584.4, 1590.16)", and relative humidity and all these other different variables so we're now linking a lot of the pdke products,1584.4,1590.16
"(1590.16, 1595.2)", the hawaii rangeland information portal to the http so that we have this information coming in,1590.16,1595.2
"(1595.76, 1601.6)", the most up-to-date stuff so i have a proposal in right now to build the ccbd portfolio that i told,1595.76,1601.6
"(1601.6, 1605.9)"," you about into the http so think about it now if you want a portfolio you I told you about into the HTTP. So think about it now, if you want a portfolio,",1601.6,1605.9

"(1610.26, 1612.46)"," and we give it back to you, right?",1610.26,1612.46
"(1612.46, 1613.76)", It's a static document.,1612.46,1613.76
"(1613.76, 1615.46)", But what if you could go to the portal,1613.76,1615.46
"(1615.46, 1616.98)", and you could just hit a button,1615.46,1616.98
"(1616.98, 1619.2)"," and get your information from the portal,",1616.98,1619.2
"(1619.2, 1620.9)", just with one touch of a button.,1619.2,1620.9
"(1620.9, 1622.66)", The cyber infrastructure folks that we're working with,1620.9,1622.66
"(1622.66, 1624.82)"," are telling me that you could even draw a geography,",1622.66,1624.82
"(1624.82, 1625.16)"," upload your own geography. And what's unique about this is the portfolio you create button. The cyber infrastructure folks that we're working with are telling me that you could even draw a geography, upload",1624.82,1625.16

"(1628.88, 1632.48)", portfolio you create today will have yesterday's data in it.,1628.88,1632.48
"(1632.76, 1635.06)", Right. So it's going to be a near real time thing. So I'm,1632.76,1635.06
"(1635.06, 1637.06)", waiting for the funding to be approval for that. But we're,1635.06,1637.06

"(2258.12, 2266.42)", where how we're going to live I think a part of our job is to really optimize develop optimal strategies and move us toward,2258.12,2266.42

"(2370.68, 2372.88)", and what's gonna happen is they're gonna either,2370.68,2372.88
"(2372.88, 2374.68)", make the decision with no information,2372.88,2374.68
"(2374.68, 2376.64)", or they're gonna make it based on some information,2374.68,2376.64
"(2376.64, 2377.5)", that we provide them.,2376.64,2377.5
"(2377.5, 2378.9)"," Now I'm not telling them what to do,",2377.5,2378.9

"(2381.14, 2384.8)", that they might not have access to on the other hand.,2381.14,2384.8
"(2384.8, 2386.36)"," But yeah, all I can",2384.8,2386.36
"(2386.36, 2391.02)"," say is that, you know, we want to create the data and information, the most relevant information for",2386.36,2391.02
"(2391.02, 2395.52)", folks to utilize and find out what they need and give it to them in a format they can use.,2391.02,2395.52
"(2396.08, 2401.54)"," And how they use it, though, I mean, if there's a place for me or my team in that sphere, we're",2396.08,2401.54

"(2407.42, 2411.82)", Kaleo looks like he's come off mute. So maybe he's going to add to this. But the ranching is,2407.42,2411.82
"(2411.82, 2416.2)"," a good example. I mean, you could look at your data and one decision you could make is to adapt",2411.82,2416.2
"(2416.2, 2422.04)"," and say reduce stocking rate. But when we have a community goals to increase food production,",2416.2,2422.04

"(2426.16, 2433.28)", have the stocking rate we want on our ranch lands uh that that meet our food production goals and,2426.16,2433.28
"(2433.28, 2438.88)", yet really makes sense uh with respect to the burden upon the land and the utilization of the,2433.28,2438.88
"(2438.88, 2443.04)", resource we have and then go back to commissioner buck's point it might mean we have to make,2438.88,2443.04
"(2443.04, 2452.26)", investment that's perhaps both public and private in the reservoir systems that better hold capacity so that we can support those goals.,2443.04,2452.26
"(2452.88, 2454.5)", So that's what I'm missing.,2452.88,2454.5

"(2464.02, 2472.88)"," And is that what you're going to do, Kaleo? Are you going to talk to me about how we're stepping forward on that uh no um i mean i think",2464.02,2472.88
"(2472.88, 2479.68)", the goal would be to utilize the data and you know both in short term and long term decision making,2472.88,2479.68
"(2479.68, 2487.0)"," so you know i'm reflecting on our kuleana to manage permits, for example, and bring forward recommendations of commission.",2479.68,2487.0

"(2518.24, 2526.24)", the staff though okay that's an initial reaction i think to your your question commissioner hannes thank you chair,2518.24,2526.24
"(2526.96, 2536.24)", thank you aurora is it your turn now um thanks ryan so i guess for others ryan and i were in,2526.96,2536.24
"(2536.24, 2546.0)", the same same lab he was finishing his phd as i was on the way so it's really awesome to hear the update and where things are now um,2536.24,2546.0
"(2547.14, 2553.26)", and and yeah and where things are headed so I guess I had a question and then I had an offer,2547.14,2553.26
"(2553.26, 2562.26)", a couple questions one for the um Hawaii rangeland information portal which is super cool are you,2553.26,2562.26

"(2709.6, 2712.62)", where the portfolio is something we can do for anybody.,2709.6,2712.62
"(2712.62, 2714.14)"," So we make the portfolio,",2712.62,2714.14
"(2714.14, 2716.36)", the next step would be to sit down with the stakeholder,2714.14,2716.36
"(2716.36, 2718.48)"," and go through the portfolio and say,",2716.36,2718.48

"(2720.96, 2723.6)", and what else can we provide for you there?,2720.96,2723.6
"(2723.6, 2734.0)", And then the idea of the knowledge exchange is the document lessons learned to get any information we can and compile it into kind of a centralized clearing house to create these drought,2723.6,2734.0
"(2734.0, 2746.32)"," needs assessments these things that are, you know, kind of encapsulate kind of the broader issues, and maybe even specific issues that might be relevant to other folks. So there is",2734.0,2746.32
"(2746.32, 2750.96)"," that part of the exchange also is kind of, you know, bringing together information from individuals",2746.32,2750.96
"(2750.96, 2757.12)", and putting it in a cohesive way where others can kind of learn from those lessons. And so that's,2750.96,2757.12
"(2757.12, 2762.32)"," kind of where the incorporation of local knowledge comes in, but it's not something you carry out,",2757.12,2762.32

"(2798.0, 2805.38)", And maybe this is for Kaleo speaking to Commissioner bucks question or and Commissioner Hannes maybe a future this,2798.0,2805.38
"(2805.38, 2813.5)", is focused on drought but I think Dr. Yunfan Tsang is really where the flooding issues,2805.38,2813.5
"(2813.5, 2817.98)", when we're thinking about extremes she's doing a lot of work on flooding and there's going,2813.5,2817.98
"(2817.98, 2828.24)", to be more work done on flooding she works with folks on Kauai as well. So that would be a good complimentary informational briefing.,2817.98,2828.24
"(2829.36, 2834.32)"," Yeah, so don't let the drought in Pacific Drought Knowledge Exchange fool you. You know,",2829.36,2834.32
"(2834.32, 2839.36)"," we're happy to bring in flooding information too. And I don't know, I don't think we'll change the",2834.32,2839.36
"(2839.36, 2845.2)"," acronym, but there's also, HAIMA, I mentioned funding the fire risk and warning tool.",2839.36,2845.2

"(2857.72, 2867.24)", So the portfolios and eventually all these tools will also incorporate the flooding information. And I know Dr. Yin-Fan Tsang is working on developing,2857.72,2867.24
"(2867.24, 2870.62)"," a soil moisture, gritted soil moisture",2867.24,2870.62

"(3143.64, 3146.28)"," It's, you know, the manager of the watershed.",3143.64,3146.28
"(3148.66, 3149.82)", We're in Guam.,3148.66,3149.82
"(3149.94, 3154.74)", I'm working with somebody at the university and at the Weary Center over there.,3149.94,3154.74
"(3155.34, 3160.02)", So it really depends on who's the point of contact for an individual who manages land resources.,3155.34,3160.02
"(3160.52, 3163.52)"," That's really the person on the ground, the ranchers.",3160.52,3163.52
"(3163.66, 3170.16)"," It's the individual, the person in the ranch who's actually managing the livestock not the administrator so it's really",3163.66,3170.16
"(3170.16, 3173.76)", we want to work with the people that are actually going to use the tools use the data that's kind,3170.16,3173.76
"(3173.76, 3178.08)", of something we try to identify early on and i'm working with the hawaii cattlemen's council right,3173.76,3178.08
"(3178.08, 3181.12)", now and we're setting up these meetings and i'm like i don't want to meet with the person who,3178.08,3181.12
"(3181.12, 3185.36)", owns the ranch i want to meet with the person that's going to actually manage the livestock,3181.12,3185.36
"(3185.36, 3187.52)", and see if this tool can help them.,3185.36,3187.52
"(3187.52, 3193.08)"," We work with NRCS, also USGS and, you know, Nature Conservancy",3187.52,3193.08
"(3193.08, 3195.88)", and a lot of different folks that kind of put us in touch with the right people.,3193.08,3195.88
"(3195.88, 3198.48)", So it's kind of a really grassroots project.,3195.88,3198.48
"(3198.48, 3203.64)", The PDK has really no model on how you find people or identify resource managers.,3198.48,3203.64
"(3203.64, 3209.64)"," It's and I'm sorry if it's kind of a big answer, but we're still kind of getting going",3203.64,3209.64
"(3209.64, 3212.52)", with it at this point.,3209.64,3212.52
"(3212.52, 3214.48)"," And then your first question, sir.",3212.52,3214.48
"(3214.48, 3225.76)"," From your research, what is sort of the window for climate trends?",3214.48,3225.76
"(3226.36, 3230.12)"," The thing about climate in Hawaii is that we have this crazy inter-annual variability,",3226.36,3230.12
"(3230.42, 3235.16)", which we get wet years and dry years. And we see sometimes where it doesn't line up the way we,3230.42,3235.16
"(3235.16, 3240.96)"," think it's going to line up. I think that what folks should be wary about is the next El Nino,",3235.16,3240.96
"(3241.58, 3251.52)", because we have had eight of the last nine years have been the hottest on record and uh we are at like 45 years uh of above temperatures in the instrumental record,3241.58,3251.52
"(3251.52, 3255.76)", and the next El Nino is probably going to send things off the charts that's kind of my my gut,3251.52,3255.76
"(3255.76, 3260.4)", feeling on this and we've been in La Nina for the last three years so we have not felt the full,3255.76,3260.4
"(3260.4, 3265.12)", effects of what the atmosphere has is doing and what the ocean is doing and I think that you,3260.4,3265.12
"(3265.12, 3269.44)", know the next El Nino which could even be next winter it's going to be a really hot dry winter,3265.12,3269.44
"(3269.44, 3274.88)", so that that's in the very near term I think the next El Nino is going to kind of send us into a,3269.44,3274.88
"(3274.88, 3279.92)", next understanding of where the climate is going in the short term I think you know because,3274.88,3279.92
"(3279.92, 3284.88)", temperature you know rainfall we don't know what's going to happen with rainfall we have some ideas,3279.92,3284.88
"(3284.88, 3287.84)", we have some models that tell us one tells us it's gonna be drier one tells it's gonna,3284.88,3287.84
"(3287.84, 3292.16)", be wetter it's not really something that we can put our fingers down i'm careful when i talk about,3287.84,3292.16
"(3292.16, 3296.48)", trends and rainfall because a trend in rainfall a lot of time depends on where you start it and,3292.16,3296.48
"(3296.48, 3302.64)", where you end it so i i hesitate to say to say things about rainfall but i can say that you know,3296.48,3302.64
"(3302.64, 3305.68)", um the temperature is rising and there's no stopping it,3302.64,3305.68
"(3305.68, 3310.0)", and we look at the future what the models are telling us for temperature we see a much warmer,3305.68,3310.0
"(3310.0, 3315.44)", environment in hawaii where species are going to have a hard time to adapt certain agricultural,3310.0,3315.44
"(3315.44, 3320.0)", product products are not going to grow well and people's discomfort and health are going to be,3315.44,3320.0
"(3320.0, 3325.28)", at risk and i think that that is an unavoidable consequence at this point given the trajectory,3320.0,3325.28
"(3325.28, 3329.6)", that the world is on and the mitigation efforts that are that are somewhat failing somewhat,3325.28,3329.6
"(3329.6, 3335.36)", working but really i think the we need to plan for a warmer world in the in the mid and and and,3329.6,3335.36
"(3335.36, 3350.4)", centuries uh without really any doubt of that well i think that's the challenge for this group is how do we protect our water resources so we can continue to enjoy a,3335.36,3350.4
"(3350.4, 3356.4)", healthy lifestyle in a vibrant lifestyle so i think this research is key and you know to,3350.4,3356.4
"(3356.4, 3369.68)", commissioner hannis and commissioner buck's comments is so we really need to have the ability to make long-term decisions or decisions that will protect,3356.4,3369.68
"(3369.68, 3374.88)", our future so hopefully that you can help us you know there's a lot of water management areas of,3369.68,3374.88
"(3374.88, 3380.24)", maui that probably could use your work and your help anyway thank you very much for your,3374.88,3380.24
"(3380.24, 3391.68)", presentation thank you for your comments thank you commissioners i just have some final comments um i really appreciated this you'll find i'm a real process and community engagement person,3380.24,3391.68
"(3392.24, 3400.4)", in my view this the tool is somewhat leveling the playing field it provides the community's,3392.24,3400.4
"(3400.4, 3407.08)", access to information without having to pay for a consultant. So it really helps us with informed decision making.,3400.4,3407.08
"(3407.28, 3409.12)", A lot of times,3407.28,3409.12
"(3409.32, 3412.24)", DLNR are far beyond just,3409.32,3412.24
"(3412.44, 3413.36)", water issues.,3412.44,3413.36
"(3413.56, 3418.04)", It's the whole climate change between OCCL and shoreline erosion and looking at,3413.56,3418.04
"(3418.24, 3421.84)"," trends. But I think for purposes of the Water Commission,",3418.24,3421.84
"(3422.04, 3424.72)"," the tool provides us better,",3422.04,3424.72
"(3424.92, 3426.88)", a better information to make informed,3424.92,3426.88
"(3426.88, 3432.4)", decision making especially we may have to start putting conditions about you know adaptation,3426.88,3432.4
"(3432.96, 3439.68)", maybe we have to make changes more often in our our long-term water leases some of these are very,3432.96,3439.68
"(3439.68, 3448.6)"," long and we see that the changes may be much more frequent. And so we have to be able to adjust, think about today,",3439.68,3448.6
"(3448.6, 3450.62)"," what's, you know, what are some of these trends",3448.6,3450.62
"(3450.62, 3453.94)"," looking in the future, but giving us greater flexibility",3450.62,3453.94
"(3453.94, 3456.76)", to incorporate those into some of our permit conditions.,3453.94,3456.76
"(3456.76, 3459.76)", So I think that this is an extremely helpful tool,3456.76,3459.76
"(3459.76, 3463.12)", that I am certain the Water Commission staff,3459.76,3463.12
"(3463.12, 3465.7)", is going to consider as part of their checkoff,3463.12,3465.7
"(3465.7, 3470.0)", list when they're looking at all the different databases that this is going to be one that,3465.7,3470.0
"(3470.0, 3471.0)", they're going to look at.,3470.0,3471.0
"(3471.0, 3476.5)", So I am extremely appreciative for the good work that you and your staff have done.,3471.0,3476.5
"(3476.5, 3479.32)", I appreciate the cultural integration.,3476.5,3479.32
"(3479.32, 3486.8)"," Too often we are not incorporating Indigenous knowledge and recognizing that value. So you've really,",3479.32,3486.8
"(3488.32, 3492.96)"," you've come to us with a very whole package and it's very, you know, a lot of the issues that",3488.32,3492.96
"(3492.96, 3499.2)"," people have criticized science on, you seem to have incorporated a lot of that to create a real",3492.96,3499.2
"(3499.2, 3506.52)", good balance and great credibility and integrity into the document. So thank you on behalf of the commission for the good work.,3499.2,3506.52
"(3506.52, 3508.74)", And I'm certain our department's gonna use you,3506.52,3508.74
"(3508.74, 3510.04)", a lot more often.,3508.74,3510.04
"(3510.04, 3511.86)", So thank you very much.,3510.04,3511.86
"(3512.86, 3513.78)", Chair.,3512.86,3513.78
"(3513.78, 3514.62)"," Yes, go ahead.",3513.78,3514.62
"(3514.62, 3516.7)"," I might, thanks for those comments.",3514.62,3516.7
"(3516.7, 3521.02)", And I really liked your idea about this being part,3516.7,3521.02
"(3521.02, 3528.0)", of the protocol of our staff to indicate whether or not matters that come before,3521.02,3528.0
"(3528.0, 3533.44)", us have gone have been calibrated against the uh the various data sets that we have,3528.0,3533.44
"(3534.4, 3540.72)", and you know i think about the agency reviews and the kapokai analysis and and so forth is it,3534.4,3540.72
"(3540.72, 3562.5)"," possible to kind of really highlight what those relevant data sets are and indicate in every case, just as a tool and kind of a template for staff to make sure that they're checked for the, there's a review against those data sets on matters that come before us?",3540.72,3562.5
"(3562.84, 3566.32)"," Kaleo, is that possible or are we do i think we do it a lot now",3562.84,3566.32
"(3566.32, 3571.76)", but i mean if you created part of the template it's just it's automatic we know we got it,3566.32,3571.76
"(3572.88, 3579.2)", yeah i think that's definitely something we can incorporate um a lot of our data the uh,3572.88,3579.2
"(3579.2, 3586.88)", climate data discussion and dialogue happens in the water plant but as indicated last month um that come,3579.2,3586.88
"(3586.88, 3591.6)", oftentimes as much as we say it's a living document it's kind of static right and so i think,3586.88,3591.6
"(3591.6, 3597.2)", even utilizing these tools and building into our our routing and review we can definitely do that,3591.6,3597.2
"(3597.2, 3603.68)", and look at how to build and make more submittals even more robust um so i'll work i'll take that,3597.2,3603.68
"(3603.68, 3605.2)", back and we can work with staff to,3603.68,3605.2
"(3605.2, 3611.2)", look at um you know how to utilize these this data in our analysis and recommendations commission,3605.2,3611.2
"(3614.32, 3619.44)", yeah one one little add-on to that thanks commissioner hannis um and to deputy manual,3614.32,3619.44
"(3619.44, 3636.3)"," maybe um you know just as the staff use iw reds to look at what, like, there can be a formalized way to pull in the HCDP or PDK information as part of that assessment.",3619.44,3636.3
"(3636.56, 3639.76)", I think that might be a tangible way to make it happen.,3636.56,3639.76
"(3639.76, 3648.32)"," And just thank you again, longman ryan um would you mind sharing your screen again on",3639.76,3648.32

"(3654.64, 3660.24)", be interested in following up can we make these slides your powerpoint slides available because,3654.64,3660.24
"(3660.24, 3665.6)", then we can post them on our website and people can have access yeah yeah you can,3660.24,3665.6
"(3670.0, 3673.92)", links to it or something yeah i mean you can visit the if you just google the hawaii climate data portal you can access that if you just google the pacific drought knowledge exchange,3670.0,3673.92
"(3673.92, 3678.48)", there's a website for that also but the hawaii climate data portal um you can go to interact,3673.92,3678.48
"(3678.48, 3683.28)", the tool i didn't really get into that the the weeds on the portal but you can make a rainfall,3678.48,3683.28

"(4420.16, 4425.7)", williams i'm the chief of staff for the Joint Task Force Red Hills. So I work for Admiral,4420.16,4425.7
"(4425.7, 4432.66)"," Wade. And so what I'd like to do today, just very humbly, thank you for allowing us to be here to",4425.7,4432.66
"(4432.66, 4439.82)"," present this. Really two things I want to talk about today is just in brief, go over our mission",4432.66,4439.82
"(4439.82, 4446.02)", and then give you an update on our timeline and be able to answer any questions on that.,4439.82,4446.02
"(4446.18, 4449.34)", But you should see the Mission and End State slide up here.,4446.18,4449.34
"(4449.46, 4453.76)"," Some of you have seen this before, but just as a way to give us context,",4449.46,4453.76

"(4503.58, 4507.2)"," So with that, as you look at this really two-part",4503.58,4507.2
"(4508.32, 4513.36)", we were directed to one safely and expeditiously defuel the facility,4508.32,4513.36
"(4514.64, 4523.36)", part of that mission also was to rebuild trust with the community the state of the hawaii and,4514.64,4523.36

"(5327.06, 5332.44)", increase water that the Navy has access to. So the Navy IEA Halawa Shaft is one of our,5327.06,5332.44
"(5332.44, 5339.28)", drinking water locations that has been offline since December 3 of 2021. And so we've been,5332.44,5339.28
"(5339.28, 5344.06)", looking at ways that we could display that that water quality meets safe drinking water,5339.28,5344.06
"(5344.06, 5345.44)", standards and could be an appropriate option if we needed an that that water quality meets safe drinking water standards and and could,5344.06,5345.44
"(5345.44, 5350.96)", be an appropriate option if we needed an extra drinking water source so we have submitted a,5345.44,5350.96
"(5350.96, 5357.6)", request to the department of health to uh consider or at least give us the conditions for which we,5350.96,5357.6

"(5509.06, 5513.04)", One of those was to close in place and render inoperable,5509.06,5513.04

"(5521.46, 5523.88)", but for beneficial reuse.,5521.46,5523.88
"(5523.88, 5526.32)", And I'll speak to that here in a minute.,5523.88,5526.32
"(5526.32, 5530.96)", And that was requested by DOH to look at those options.,5526.32,5530.96
"(5530.96, 5532.94)"," We have the next one would be,",5530.96,5532.94

"(5536.64, 5540.94)", or some sort of material that renders it,5536.64,5540.94
"(5541.94, 5544.72)", an additional level of inoperability.,5541.94,5544.72
"(5544.72, 5548.08)", And then the final one would be close and remove,5544.72,5548.08
"(5548.08, 5555.44)", the steel liner and of the structures that exist in there today and then fill those voids backfill,5548.08,5555.44
"(5556.08, 5562.24)", the navy has recommended option one to close in place and executing this plan is roughly three,5556.08,5562.24
"(5562.24, 5566.88)", years and a lot of that stuff breaks down into the fact that,5562.24,5566.88
"(5566.88, 5574.32)", uh where we are today concurrently working through uh decision-making processes uh involving the,5566.88,5574.32

"(5581.44, 5585.84)", rendering safe so that does take time.,5581.44,5585.84
"(5588.0, 5591.4)"," So, but the option that we did propose just for everyone's informational purposes was,",5588.0,5591.4
"(5591.4, 5595.98)", this we deemed was the least impactful to the environment.,5591.4,5595.98
"(5596.92, 5600.6)", It was least impactful to the surrounding community.,5596.92,5600.6
"(5602.72, 5604.38)"," I would say not the easiest,",5602.72,5604.38

"(5610.0, 5617.0)"," And the fill option would be as I add that one, and I spoke about that with number 4, depending on what we decide.",5610.0,5617.0
"(5617.0, 5634.0)"," It almost it's relative to the trucks and the impact of the community and stuff, and why we kind of didn't go down that path was looking at these other options up front was we also could see speed and safety and but least environmental impact and so then you start talking trucks and other material removal.",5617.0,5634.0
"(5634.0, 5655.0)"," It just becomes a longer duration closure plan has four phases and currently we're executing phase one and two in parallel one and twos planning for permanent tank closure.

"(5692.88, 5697.76)", to communicate to me about opportunities i'm very careful though when i talk to them to say hey,5692.88,5697.76
"(5697.76, 5701.92)", there's a there's a methodology by which we can go through this so that we properly vet and it,5697.76,5701.92
"(5701.92, 5708.0)", doesn't become uh personal conjecture but there's a lot of really good ideas out there.,5701.92,5708.0
"(5708.0, 5716.0)"," So right now, the request by DOH was back in July, to look at the beneficial the non fuel reuse.",5708.0,5716.0
"(5716.0, 5729.28)"," And we awarded a contract to a local want native wine firm Nakapuna, that was done in the end of January. So we're working with them right now so that their survey will be released to",5716.0,5729.28

"(5753.0, 5768.0)"," And when you're looking at some of those things, you know, we're looking at, you know, environmental input, utilities requirements, economic benefit, long term maintenance, engineering requirements, there's a whole host of issues that go into that.",5753.0,5768.0
"(5768.0, 5773.0)", And that is not just an easy decision. There's a lot of good ideas that all make sense.,5768.0,5773.0

"(6210.24, 6218.64)", we one third of of what we do um as a as a the water commission and i want to come to the other,6210.24,6218.64
"(6218.64, 6225.16)", two issues uh later but it's really important for the first one is how long will that system be offline?,6218.64,6225.16
"(6231.64, 6232.24)", And how long it's offline depends on the past contamination as well as future risks.,6231.64,6232.24
"(6237.54, 6249.04)"," And what I see in this for the first time is kind of a comprehensive plan for how you're going to deal with that. And if I'm reading it correctly, I see that the fuel the the tanks will be defueled by june 23rd uh uh june of 2024.",6237.54,6249.04
"(6249.04, 6256.64)", is that did i hear that read that correctly yes sir yes sir okay i didn't see an end date for the,6249.04,6256.64
"(6256.64, 6268.04)", remediation and that's somewhat understandable but will we be working toward an end date for when you anticipate and and to the to the the continuing reminders,6256.64,6268.04
"(6268.04, 6273.8)", that the caveat below that things can change of course they can't you know that's why you do that's,6268.04,6273.8
"(6273.8, 6279.62)", why you set out a plan and you have variance reporting and what but do we have an idea yet,6273.8,6279.62
"(6279.62, 6287.04)", as to when the uh the contamination will be remediated and we can bring these systems back online and drink,6279.62,6287.04
"(6287.04, 6294.0)"," that water? Sir, I'll answer that question. So environmental remediation doesn't have a clear",6287.04,6294.0
"(6294.0, 6300.72)", timeline at this time. One of the key markers is going to have to be that we defuel the tanks and,6294.0,6300.72
"(6300.72, 6305.52)", complete a comprehensive site assessment of the facility to be able to identify,6300.72,6305.52
"(6305.52, 6310.12)"," exactly where we have contamination, not only from the events that happened in November",6305.52,6310.12
"(6310.12, 6315.72)"," of 2021, but also look for any potential contamination from any other things that have happened at",6310.12,6315.72

"(6327.8, 6333.62)", be approved as a drinking water source however it is one of our mitigation strategies to pursue usage,6327.8,6333.62
"(6333.62, 6339.92)", of that water again but understanding that we need to have extra contingency protections in,6333.62,6339.92
"(6339.92, 6345.2)", place for our community and for the drinking water system so that project is underway with a,6339.92,6345.2
"(6345.2, 6352.8)", temporary project in place with a goal of 2025 and a permanent project in place in 2027. so those,6345.2,6352.8
"(6352.8, 6357.84)", those efforts would not be pursued until after the tanks are defueled and the primary risk of,6352.8,6357.84
"(6357.84, 6362.88)", contamination is removed from the hill so as of right now those are kind of the efforts that we're,6357.84,6362.88
"(6362.88, 6365.36)", pursuing for those that that specific,6362.88,6365.36
"(6365.36, 6371.52)", shaft for the navy aya halaba shaft uh we would pursue that on a more sooner term just because,6365.36,6371.52
"(6371.52, 6377.28)", we haven't seen direct contamination of that source so as of right now we are pursuing an,6371.52,6377.28
"(6377.28, 6382.24)", emergency status but we're also looking at treatment options on a contingency basis,6377.28,6382.24
"(6382.24, 6386.4)", just to create a protection measure for the community what i take,6382.24,6386.4
"(6386.4, 6394.0)", from that is that this system which supplies 25 of the drinking water for uh oahu will be offline,6386.4,6394.0
"(6394.0, 6405.6)", at least until 2027. there is potential in 2025 to have a temporary system stood up in place while the long-term system is being built,6394.0,6405.6
"(6405.6, 6411.84)", but that is dependent on regulatory approval so thank you uh and just to get to just get,6405.6,6411.84
"(6411.84, 6416.64)", the last one so the tank repurposing that decision would be made next month,6411.84,6416.64
"(6419.28, 6425.4)"," with the doh's approval did i read that correctly? No, no, Commissioner, this is Captain Ertzema.",6419.28,6425.4
"(6426.48, 6431.48)"," No, so what we're doing right now is that we don't know,",6426.48,6431.48
"(6431.48, 6433.08)", we're working with DOH.,6431.48,6433.08
"(6433.08, 6436.56)"," Ideally, when we submit additional information",6433.08,6436.56
"(6436.56, 6440.22)", to continue to move that decision-making process forward,6436.56,6440.22
"(6440.22, 6444.6)"," in that supplement number two, it allows DOH",6440.22,6444.6
"(6444.6, 6448.22)", and the regulators to make an informed decision in partnership with us.,6444.6,6448.22
"(6448.4, 6455.14)"," So I would say eminent, but I don't want to speak for DOH is what I would say on that,",6448.4,6455.14
"(6455.48, 6466.72)", because what we know we're going with option one until we see or told there's another methodology by which we need to execute i because we have to,6455.48,6466.72
"(6466.72, 6472.16)", make a decision to move out so that we at least do not lose momentum uh but understanding that option,6466.72,6472.16
"(6472.16, 6480.4)", one uh is is at least um will support and informs moving into any one of the other options if that,6472.16,6480.4
"(6480.4, 6485.68)", needs to change so as soon as you determine that option then you create a plan,6480.4,6485.68
"(6485.68, 6491.76)", as you have with the other two uh with remediation and defueling that really sets up milestones,6485.68,6491.76
"(6493.04, 6499.68)", to completion and from our standpoint that's what we want to see at each meeting when you come in,6493.04,6499.68
"(6501.76, 6508.98)"," before with a briefing here's your plan to the targeted outcomes, and here's your progress",6501.76,6508.98
"(6508.98, 6514.96)", or your lack of progress or your setbacks in meeting those milestones. That's a productive,6508.98,6514.96
"(6514.96, 6522.52)", use of our time and really helps us track this to closure. So I really appreciate that we're,6514.96,6522.52
"(6522.52, 6525.52)", finally getting here because so often we've had people,6522.52,6525.52
"(6525.52, 6531.18)", just talk about activity without relationship to kind of a clear goal or outcome.,6525.52,6531.18
"(6531.18, 6534.9)", And this is a great improvement.,6531.18,6534.9
"(6534.9, 6536.96)"," And I'll just say this last thing, Chair.",6534.9,6536.96
"(6536.96, 6541.62)"," So this, as I understand it, is one third of our issue here.",6536.96,6541.62
"(6541.62, 6546.4)", How long will this part of the cyst are or a waffle based system,6541.62,6546.4
"(6546.4, 6552.4)", be offline the second thing we have to to continue to to look at it's not the navy's uh job to do,6546.4,6552.4
"(6552.4, 6560.96)", this it's our staff's job is what pressures are upon our ex our others uh parts of the system that,6552.4,6560.96
"(6560.96, 6571.84)", are now meeting the demand that was once met by this part the halawa and red hill aquifer you know how are they doing in terms of meeting existing uh allocations as,6560.96,6571.84
"(6571.84, 6577.84)", well as future demand you know because if they're not if they're stressed if we're pushing beyond,6571.84,6577.84
"(6577.84, 6583.84)", the point of sustainable yields then we've got to think about conservation measures and some and,6577.84,6583.84
"(6583.84, 6591.34)", scrolling back some of those commitments and the third dimension is what does this tell us about the need to have new sources developed.,6583.84,6591.34
"(6592.42, 6608.56)"," That don't utilize a soccer for that's going to be offline at least till 2025 and possibly beyond that so to me those those as and correct me if i'm wrong chair Chair or Kaleo, those are our three key issues in this.",6592.42,6608.56
"(6608.56, 6615.4)"," And now we are finally getting a clear plan to track and monitor, you know, for the first",6608.56,6615.4
"(6615.4, 6616.4)", part of that issue.,6615.4,6616.4
"(6616.4, 6619.4)"," Kaleo, did you want to comment?",6616.4,6619.4
"(6619.4, 6627.26)"," I'll quickly react and then I, we have staff online break that are lead on this but",6619.4,6627.26
"(6627.26, 6633.44)", um yeah we know working on understanding the whole system and our aquifers as a whole as,6627.26,6633.44
"(6633.44, 6641.18)", the navy is one of the many users in this area is really important another thing from,6633.44,6641.18
"(6641.18, 6645.98)", a regulatory standpoint right making sure we're managing everyone's uses,6641.18,6645.98
"(6647.02, 6649.64)", in addition to the Navy is another.,6647.02,6649.64
"(6649.64, 6652.7)"," And again, it all ties into this whole data conversation",6649.64,6652.7
"(6652.7, 6653.54)"," that we just had, right?",6652.7,6653.54
"(6653.54, 6657.78)", And that we need everyone to help support the commission,6653.54,6657.78
"(6657.78, 6660.08)", in its regulatory role by providing timely,6657.78,6660.08
"(6660.08, 6663.62)", and accurate data so we can do that analysis,6660.08,6663.62
"(6663.62, 6665.12)", and make recommendations for the commission to,6663.62,6665.12
"(6665.12, 6671.28)", consider so um yeah all of those are very important and and i think you kind of framed well,6665.12,6671.28
"(6671.28, 6676.32)", what what are some of our priorities there are there are others that we have to consider but in,6671.28,6676.32
"(6676.32, 6682.0)", general those those are in alignment i don't know if ryan wanted to add anything from his,6676.32,6682.0
"(6682.0, 6687.36)", perspective as the head of our groundwater program um no i don't,6682.0,6687.36
"(6687.36, 6697.12)", really have anything to add except that we want to try to stay on top of any plans to maybe open up,6687.36,6697.12
"(6698.0, 6706.96)", some sources in emergency situations and so we're um actively as kaleo was saying um you know reporting is important,6698.0,6706.96
"(6707.6, 6714.64)", um the second component of that is for us to actively monitor the data that comes from,6707.6,6714.64
"(6714.64, 6720.0)", reporting to understand what are going to be the potential environmental impacts attributed to,6714.64,6720.0
"(6720.0, 6726.64)", turning sources on or shifting sources elsewhere yeah thank you and neil this is,6720.0,6726.64
"(6726.64, 6733.04)", i would just say that we are really we are also as a matter of coordination trying to work closer,6726.64,6733.04
"(6733.04, 6740.08)", with board of water supply and doing a more you know kind of a collaborative engagement with them,6733.04,6740.08
"(6740.08, 6747.16)", so that through the good data we are better able to make better decisions there's currently,6740.08,6747.16
"(6747.16, 6753.36)", also through the legislature there's some bills in process that may give us some additional tools,6747.16,6753.36
"(6753.36, 6760.7)", to better manage and regulate the system so i think appreciate you know the comment and rest,6753.36,6760.7
"(6760.7, 6765.06)"," assured i think we are you, including the governor's office,",6760.7,6765.06
"(6765.06, 6768.3)"," is really looking at this in a very comprehensive way,",6765.06,6768.3
"(6768.3, 6771.58)", trying to build and recognizing that the Navy,6768.3,6771.58
"(6771.58, 6775.48)", has got to be a partner with us through the good data,6771.58,6775.48
"(6775.48, 6776.98)", to help us make better decisions.,6775.48,6776.98

"(6797.36, 6800.66)", Can we anticipate tracking the progress against the milestones?,6797.36,6800.66
"(6801.44, 6806.42)"," I think, Neil, I don't think we're going to have the Indo-PACOM, the Navy,",6801.44,6806.42
"(6806.42, 6808.28)", come to us on a monthly basis.,6806.42,6808.28

"(6815.76, 6819.56)"," But I think that this was a really good,",6815.76,6819.56
"(6819.56, 6824.36)", I think my desire was to create a platform,6819.56,6824.36
"(6824.36, 6825.0)"," to get good information,",6824.36,6825.0
"(6826.12, 6830.62)"," to give us some baseline, get us to know the Navy,",6826.12,6830.62
"(6830.62, 6833.52)", but it's really to provide the Navy an opportunity,6830.62,6833.52
"(6833.52, 6837.14)"," to give us good, accurate, current information.",6833.52,6837.14

"(6843.0, 6846.52)", It may not be in-person person presentations but it may be written,6843.0,6846.52
"(6846.52, 6853.32)", presentations but my top of the head suggestion is at least quarterly that they come before us,6846.52,6853.32
"(6853.32, 6859.2)", to have a report and unless there's a significant variance and if there's a significant variance,6853.32,6859.2
"(6859.2, 6865.52)", that we ought to know about then whenever it happens they they come to us okay good question i see the navy,6859.2,6865.52
"(6865.52, 6874.0)", shaking their head so i have got um aurora i think i saw your hand up next and then i i'm sorry can i,6865.52,6874.0
"(6874.0, 6881.04)", just jump in to address commissioner hannis's um concerns so um what i can do is through some of,6874.0,6881.04

"(6915.28, 6921.2)", updates on a more regular basis than the commission meetings I think certainly with respect to the,6915.28,6921.2
"(6921.2, 6926.4)", allocations and the things that the that the commission um are directly,6921.2,6926.4
"(6926.96, 6936.24)", responsible for we can request updates as those are necessary thanks thank you aurora and then,6926.96,6936.24
"(6936.24, 6949.0)", i've got mike after that um thanks commissioner hannes i agree this is is really helpful to see kind of the synoptic view of the plans.,6936.24,6949.0
"(6949.0, 6953.0)", Those written plans are very dense and hard and inaccessible.,6949.0,6953.0
"(6953.0, 6960.0)", So the the infographics are helpful. I have a suggestion for the staff.,6953.0,6960.0
"(6960.0, 6965.68)"," I mean, I think it would help we were hearing from the navy or an organizations represented sort of in that",6960.0,6965.68
"(6965.68, 6971.6)", group to hear in tandem with our staff our groundwater staff on what they're measuring,6965.68,6971.6
"(6971.6, 6977.2)", what you know what because you guys Ryan I mean we're we have data from again all the users so,6971.6,6977.2
"(6977.2, 6983.68)", if we can hear either in alternating months or next to each other like okay we have this usage,6977.2,6983.68
"(6983.68, 6985.82)", we have these changing usages this is our status oh by the way the next three each other like okay we have this usage we have these changing usages this is our status,6983.68,6985.82
"(6985.82, 6991.96)", oh by the way the next three months look like they're going to be dry we can make more sort of,6985.82,6991.96
"(6991.96, 6998.28)", have a more informed view of the status of our waimalu moanalua you know pro harbour aquifer,6991.96,6998.28
"(6998.28, 7015.6)"," sector area so um if that's possible and if the um the open public meetings can not just be forwarded to us, but maybe if they're public, if they're really public, if they can be shared also on the Commission Red Hill page so that the public can access it.",6998.28,7015.6
"(7016.72, 7026.58)"," So I have questions for Navy representatives and mostly to help me understand your infographics. The first was, I apologize, I didn't catch the",7016.72,7026.58
"(7026.58, 7032.52)"," name of the first speaker, if it was General Hashimoto or Captain Gerritsma, but that first",7026.58,7032.52
"(7032.52, 7039.84)"," diagram with the Gantt chart, it looked like there were, in general, like three or four words that",7032.52,7039.84
"(7039.84, 7050.86)"," were repeated. And there was dewatering, which you explained as removing moisture related to corrosion and then there was repacking and then there was sort of a large undefined window called",7039.84,7050.86
"(7050.86, 7057.3)", unforeseen repairs and maintenance before defueling and then final unpacking can you just explain those,7050.86,7057.3
"(7057.3, 7065.44)", terms in lay terminology yeah so ma'am first of all Colonel colonel kevin williams i'm a u.s army officer,7057.3,7065.44
"(7065.44, 7070.0)", i'm part of the joint task force just and this is part of the command and control operational,7065.44,7070.0
"(7070.0, 7077.2)", command and control um so yeah so so ma'am the i i explained the dewatering and that was you know,7070.0,7077.2
"(7077.2, 7085.94)"," simply just removing uh built up condensation from the tanks, which helps and prevent corrosion, right? So make sure we're",7077.2,7085.94
"(7085.94, 7091.78)"," checking to make sure that, you know, the quality of the tank and the pipes, we get the water out",7085.94,7091.78
"(7091.78, 7098.74)"," of there before we defuel. The repacking of the lines, the repacking of the lines before we can",7091.78,7098.74
"(7098.74, 7111.24)"," go to defuel and do the gravity fed, right, to let gravity drain them out, we will now have to reintroduce fuel into the lines to stabilize the equilibrium there.",7098.74,7111.24
"(7111.32, 7113.38)", That's probably the simplest way to say it.,7111.32,7113.38
"(7113.4, 7114.8)", So we don't put additional pressure.,7113.4,7114.8
"(7115.4, 7117.2)", It's one continuous system.,7115.4,7117.2
"(7117.76, 7121.84)", And that evolution allows us then to repack the lines.,7117.76,7121.84
"(7122.32, 7125.24)"," Now we can perform our checks,",7122.32,7125.24
"(7125.24, 7129.5)", our rehearsals on that in preparation for the defuel start.,7125.24,7129.5
"(7129.5, 7131.94)", And that's kind of how that works.,7129.5,7131.94
"(7131.94, 7134.62)"," And it's also a chance to, you know,",7131.94,7134.62
"(7134.62, 7137.64)"," again, because of the emergency order,",7134.62,7137.64
"(7137.64, 7140.62)"," since unpacking, during unpacking in October,",7137.64,7140.62
"(7140.62, 7144.2)"," we did, you know, move the valves",7140.62,7144.2
"(7144.2, 7147.44)", that hadn't been moved since the spill this is just,7144.2,7147.44
"(7147.44, 7154.24)", another check to allow us to to make sure those systems are good and then we allowed for that,7147.44,7154.24
"(7154.24, 7160.56)", window during that period you see the unforeseen repairs and maintenance as we do that repacking,7154.24,7160.56
"(7160.56, 7165.86)", evolution is just to make sure we can go over that with a fine tooth comb to make sure,7160.56,7165.86
"(7165.86, 7172.92)"," all conditions are set, not only from a repairs, but the response drills we need to do and",7165.86,7172.92
"(7172.92, 7179.76)"," partnership with the regulators to make sure all the training is complete, to make sure all the",7172.92,7179.76

"(7187.0, 7190.0)", So that's hopefully that helps describe that.,7187.0,7190.0
"(7190.0, 7198.0)"," And then as you get to the other milestones, you'll see there's, you know, the tank bottom procedure review.",7190.0,7198.0
"(7198.0, 7209.3)"," And that is really so once we drain the main tanks, there is at the tank bottom, and we have infographics and I can send this to",7198.0,7209.3
"(7209.3, 7215.96)"," the commission, but it's the draining of the fuel remaining that is not at the pipe that actually",7209.3,7215.96
"(7215.96, 7220.36)"," drains into the main line. So we just, we make sure we get that out. So that's another evolution.",7215.96,7220.36
"(7220.36, 7229.0)"," So if you can imagine, these are a series of different iterations that are using the same system, but different procedures.",7220.36,7229.0
"(7229.0, 7236.0)"," So we just want to make sure every time we do it in conjunction with the regulators, we're looking at lessons learned.",7229.0,7236.0
"(7236.0, 7246.32)", We're making sure our safety criteria and our response is set and then we do it again um and you know like you described for further updates you,7236.0,7246.32
"(7246.32, 7252.0)", know as we're drilling down with regulators because this this executive summary right it's,7246.32,7252.0
"(7252.0, 7258.4)", built on a master schedule uh with the critical path we'll make sure we're uh showing some of,7252.0,7258.4
"(7258.4, 7266.96)"," these evolutions right and so if you can imagine for every one of those milestones, and I know there's a lot on here, but we can simplify.",7258.4,7266.96
"(7266.96, 7269.2)", There's about nine major milestones.,7266.96,7269.2
"(7269.2, 7273.94)"," We're doing concepts of the operations, rehearsals,",7269.2,7273.94
"(7273.94, 7276.46)"," and that's what all that left column shows you, right?",7273.94,7276.46
"(7276.46, 7279.52)", The interdependencies that we're making sure,7276.46,7279.52
"(7279.52, 7282.42)", we're applying the rigor and the safety to do this correct.,7279.52,7282.42
"(7283.3, 7286.16)"," Ma'am, hopefully that answers your question no that that",7283.3,7286.16
"(7286.16, 7291.2)", that does help and it's my understanding that there's tremendous pressure right from these,7286.16,7291.2
"(7291.2, 7301.04)", tall tanks that is part of the safety issues and that moving fuel is risky business is that kind of,7291.2,7301.04
"(7303.84, 7307.64)"," well yes ma'am so you know that is part of what the repairs, right?",7303.84,7307.64
"(7307.64, 7309.92)", The repairs that we're doing is to make sure,7307.64,7309.92
"(7309.92, 7312.94)", that the integrity of the system,7309.92,7312.94
"(7314.46, 7318.04)"," is ready for the defueling evolution, right?",7314.46,7318.04
"(7318.04, 7320.34)", And so that's where our repair directed,7318.04,7320.34
"(7320.34, 7321.88)", and working with the regulators,7320.34,7321.88
"(7321.88, 7326.0)"," and through a third quality validation, we're making sure that's good.",7321.88,7326.0
"(7326.0, 7331.0)", But we just want to be very deliberate in our approach. Right.,7326.0,7331.0
"(7331.0, 7341.0)"," And so even the dewatering right now, this is good for us because we are going through our response plan, making sure everything is set.",7331.0,7341.0
"(7341.0, 7355.0)"," So we are doing this safely. And, you know, and that is why using the gravity fed we're just once we repack the lines we want to check everything to make sure it's ready to go, and then we can move to the next step so very deliberate,",7341.0,7355.0
"(7355.0, 7378.0)", we're trying to move fast but we're trying to move safe as well. Thank you. I I have heard significant concern that that window of unforeseen repair and maintenance could be a point at which the defueling plan might change course due to national security and i'm not gonna say that I I mean it do you have any comments,7355.0,7378.0
"(7378.0, 7389.28)"," about that. and then the other I guess statement I wanted to make is, I think, you know, taking the time to explain some of the jargon right here is part of.",7378.0,7389.28
"(7390.7, 7391.52)", I think.,7390.7,7391.52
"(7392.58, 7410.96)"," Yeah, I appreciate that because it is part of establishing some better transparency and dialogue but but there is I have heard significant concern that, oh well this long drawn out timeline, maybe, you know, maybe it's going to, these plants are just going to go poof and smoke at some point.",7392.58,7410.96
"(7410.96, 7416.3)"," I know that, nice to see you again, Mark Hashimoto here.",7410.96,7416.3
"(7416.68, 7427.36)"," So what I can, I can tell you what I've heard people with more stars than me say uh we are absolutely committed to the secretary of defense's",7416.68,7427.36
"(7427.36, 7435.92)", decision on march 7th to defuel and permanently close the red hill facility that that that is the,7427.36,7435.92
"(7435.92, 7453.0)"," only decision that's out there and that is what we are moving toward uh every single day. Thanks. Thank you. I have one more question for NAVFAC's Sarah Moody, but maybe if any other commissioners",7435.92,7453.0
"(7453.0, 7454.0)", had.,7453.0,7454.0
"(7454.0, 7458.54)"," Go ahead, Auroa, why don't you just finish your question.",7454.0,7458.54
"(7458.54, 7467.86)"," So thank you, Sarah, for describing all the detailed activities. I'm a little bit confused because of that diagram.",7458.54,7467.86
"(7467.86, 7470.84)", I see a lot of monitoring and investigation.,7467.86,7470.84
"(7470.84, 7472.52)"," And then you mentioned that remediation,",7470.84,7472.52
"(7472.52, 7476.4)"," any actual remediation would follow the defueling,",7472.52,7476.4
"(7476.4, 7479.66)", but the slide you had was called remediation.,7476.4,7479.66
"(7479.66, 7484.66)", So can you explain like why it's called remediation,7479.66,7484.66
"(7490.0, 7498.0)", when to me it's just monitoring and I am I I'm a little bit frustrated that there isn't kind of even discussion of what you're gonna do besides measure.,7490.0,7498.0
"(7498.0, 7527.2)"," Sorry i'll add some clarity. So we are actively pursuing remediation at Addit 3, where the November 2021 spill took place. And that is ongoing. We have in previous reports, done excavation outside Addit 3 where a leach tank overflowed removing, you know, 25 feet depth of soil totaling about 400 gallons of fuel we are putting in deep soil vapor monitoring ports",7498.0,7527.2
"(7527.2, 7534.32)", that are going to be utilized for a pilot to be able to use air to reduce any fuel that may be,7527.2,7534.32
"(7534.32, 7541.2)", caught in the underground to remove it we continue to skim and remove fuel from the aquifer as,7534.32,7541.2
"(7541.2, 7545.92)", possible all of that is still ongoing i think my statement about long-term,7541.2,7545.92
"(7545.92, 7552.32)", remediation for the bigger picture of red hill is that our current mission is very specifically,7545.92,7552.32
"(7552.32, 7557.92)", to add it three that the events that occurred at the red hill shaft but there is a bigger picture,7552.32,7557.92
"(7557.92, 7562.32)", of environmental care and remediation that needs to occur following the closure of the red hill,7557.92,7562.32
"(7562.32, 7571.12)", facility and that we need to look at it from a holistic standpoint of the entire facility and any other potential events that would have occurred,7562.32,7571.12
"(7571.12, 7577.6)", and and we need the fuel out of the hill to be able to do that properly and effectively so it,7571.12,7577.6
"(7578.4, 7583.68)", remediation is ongoing and that is why there are no in dates on my on my schedule because we will,7578.4,7583.68
"(7583.68, 7596.08)"," continue to pursue this until uh everyone collectively agrees that that you know we've been successful, so we are doing activities to remediate the monitoring is the ongoing as a protection measure, and those are.",7583.68,7596.08
"(7596.38, 7597.84)", Those are occurring concurrently.,7596.38,7597.84
"(7599.24, 7607.82)"," So, can you confirm that there's still free product coming into the shaft, but you mentioned it's about a tablespoon per month?",7599.24,7607.82
"(7608.58, 7613.74)", Yes. So usually we only see a sheen or free product after a large rain event.,7608.58,7613.74
"(7614.0, 7619.24)"," And when we do so, we're able to collect it with the skimmers and the booms in the shaft.",7614.0,7619.24
"(7619.38, 7625.6)", And it's an average of a teaspoon to a tablespoon a month right now.,7619.38,7625.6
"(7631.6, 7632.32)", What do we know about transport of safe dissolved contaminants beyond the Navy sentinel wells,7631.6,7632.32
"(7640.4, 7641.84)"," and immediate proximity? And you mentioned the 20, the additional nine,",7640.4,7641.84
"(7649.2, 7651.2)"," but as someone smart told me, the horse is out out of barn so what do we know about um i guess",7649.2,7651.2
"(7657.36, 7657.92)", so the goal so the original goal of adding those 22 monitoring wells was to be able to,7657.36,7657.92
"(7663.6, 7665.62)", a create a plume delineation so that we could clearly through monitoring be able to identify where the contamination had moved,7663.6,7665.62
"(7665.62, 7668.88)"," and then to B, put them on the outskirts of Red Hill",7665.62,7668.88
"(7668.88, 7671.78)"," to be able to either A, tell us if there had been",7668.88,7671.78
"(7671.78, 7675.56)"," a large transfer or B, indicate if any contamination",7671.78,7675.56
"(7675.56, 7677.38)", was moving to those locations.,7675.56,7677.38
"(7677.38, 7680.32)"," So, so far the results that we're getting",7677.38,7680.32
"(7680.32, 7682.62)", from those P wells or plume delineation wells,7680.32,7682.62
"(7682.62, 7685.98)", are showing that we don't have a lot of,7682.62,7685.98
"(7685.98, 7691.2)"," contamination outside of the immediate area of Red Hill. It just, it's not, the results aren't",7685.98,7691.2
"(7691.2, 7696.0)", indicating. All of our heat maps are showing that it's contracted down to the area directly below,7691.2,7696.0
"(7696.0, 7701.32)", the tanks from historical spill since 2014. And then right around the Red Hill shaft where we,7696.0,7701.32
"(7701.32, 7705.44)", continue to do operations. So the purpose of those is to tell us,7701.32,7705.44
"(7705.44, 7711.92)", exactly where any transport of contamination has occurred and all we can do is continue to gather,7705.44,7711.92
"(7711.92, 7718.24)", that weekly data to give us definitive answers on not only any fuel product but any content any,7711.92,7718.24
"(7718.24, 7722.56)", analytes that are related to the byproducts or the breakdown of fuel so we're looking at it from a,7718.24,7722.56
"(7722.56, 7729.12)"," comprehensive standpoint of not just current free-flowing fuel, but if there's any byproducts of the breakdown of fuel.",7722.56,7729.12
"(7729.12, 7734.64)", And that's also the efforts of the modeling of what they're trying to do is to be able to create,7729.12,7734.64
"(7734.64, 7741.92)", a model to identify where any contaminant may go if an event were to occur or predict potentially,7734.64,7741.92
"(7741.92, 7754.08)", where any contaminants went from the events that occurred in 2021. okay so there was a 2022 i think february 2022 heat map that uh looked like there was a,7741.92,7754.08
"(7754.08, 7760.0)", plume that then quickly dissipated is there a current interpretation on your end was it just,7754.08,7760.0
"(7760.0, 7765.68)", advected away or was that natural attenuation is their understanding of that because that,7760.0,7765.68
"(7766.4, 7773.84)", that heat map really lit up in 2022 and if you're not picking up anymore where did it go a lot of it,7766.4,7773.84
"(7773.84, 7777.84)", was removed directly from the red hill shaft i mean the continuous pumping of the gax of the,7773.84,7777.84
"(7777.84, 7784.8)", red hill shaft allowed us to get free product off the top of the shaft and and allowed us to,7777.84,7784.8
"(7784.8, 7786.0)", you know remove as much as,7784.8,7786.0
"(7786.0, 7791.44)", possible i think there is a level of natural attenuation and if you speak with experts they,7786.0,7791.44
"(7791.44, 7796.64)", will say that that's occurring and and you know it's happening in the strata so we do hope to,7791.44,7796.64
"(7796.64, 7802.32)", eventually pursue uh studies that will give us more definitive information on natural attenuation,7796.64,7802.32
"(7802.32, 7805.3)", this is hey doctor this is captain birds. I also want to add to that.,7802.32,7805.3
"(7805.3, 7807.54)"," So number one on the data,",7805.3,7807.54
"(7808.66, 7810.58)", I wouldn't say there was a perfect partnership,7808.66,7810.58
"(7810.58, 7813.44)", relative to the data that was released with that.,7810.58,7813.44
"(7813.44, 7816.46)"," So when you look at the monitoring wells,",7813.44,7816.46
"(7816.46, 7820.22)"," that was, those were TPH hits and spikes,",7816.46,7820.22
"(7820.22, 7822.04)", not free flowing product.,7820.22,7822.04
"(7822.04, 7825.74)", So what that demonstrates is that there's a presence.,7822.04,7825.74
"(7825.74, 7829.86)", It doesn't necessarily mean that it's thousands or hundreds of gallons.,7825.74,7829.86
"(7829.86, 7833.24)", It's just it's it's it's snipping if you will.,7829.86,7833.24
"(7833.24, 7840.68)", So it's and that was based on a certain data point in time with the most extreme in time,7833.24,7840.68

"(7848.78, 7851.94)", And now where we are today is that we are not seeing,7848.78,7851.94
"(7851.94, 7856.94)", the TPH hits like that we saw in the most extreme scenario.,7851.94,7856.94

"(7863.78, 7869.44)"," Yeah, until state EPA, community, right, every last drop",7863.78,7869.44
"(7869.44, 7876.12)"," is our goal. What we are looking at is the science between, you know, how do you define",7869.44,7876.12
"(7876.12, 7883.12)", natural attenuation? How do you watch transport? And how do you model and reconcile kind of,7876.12,7883.12
"(7883.12, 7886.8)", the differences across the science world,7883.12,7886.8
"(7886.8, 7891.36)", with the experts on what are the facts and assumptions that would go into a model,7886.8,7891.36
"(7891.36, 7897.84)", what i would say though in the transport model and in our ability to work with u of h and doh,7891.36,7897.84
"(7897.84, 7907.84)", uh and frankly any any of the other partners because we do meet weekly if not monthly um to try to reconcile where those nuances are,7897.84,7907.84
"(7907.84, 7913.76)", and how we get to a point where we can make decisions my last point i have to make this,7907.84,7913.76
"(7913.76, 7919.84)", and i appreciate it um because i've kind of been watching this since almost day one is that data,7913.76,7919.84
"(7919.84, 7925.84)", this was great i appreciate the doctor's speech or his presentation earlier i thought it was fantastic,7919.84,7925.84

"(7932.88, 7939.44)", commissioner's point on what's the impact to the system my ability to move through permitting,7932.88,7939.44
"(7939.44, 7947.64)", outside of the red hill area proper such that we can partner and demonstrate that there is no transport,7939.44,7947.64
"(7947.64, 7954.4)", or free product flowing so there's there's there needs to be that partnership and positive progress,7947.64,7954.4
"(7954.4, 7962.08)", that allows us to continue to come together so we can make a risk-based decision on on on where that,7954.4,7962.08
"(7962.08, 7965.0)", uh that challenge is going to be in the future.,7962.08,7965.0
"(7965.0, 7972.0)", And so there's a lot of efforts going on the challenge to get back to the commissioner's question on Wednesday end date.,7965.0,7972.0
"(7972.0, 7978.0)", That's driven by a lot of permitting and a lot of transparency and belief.,7972.0,7978.0
"(7978.0, 7995.0)"," After the decisions are made, and then break after that, when that allows us to move forward with some of those baby steps in the direction that the Secretary of Defense wanted us to close permanently close, then that allows us, and we'll start prior to a broader remediation.",7978.0,7995.0
"(7995.0, 8001.0)"," Because right now doing both at the same time, there are facets that we're looking at.",7995.0,8001.0

"(9294.8, 9301.28)", is the um you know the the water treatment facility the water treatment plants and things,9294.8,9301.28
"(9301.28, 9306.8)", like that yeah so i mean you gotta we're very early in that it's,9301.28,9306.8
"(9306.8, 9310.96)", just yeah when the question is always are you never going to use the water again we are at,9306.8,9310.96

"(9369.36, 9375.44)", we want to stop the whole stream we all do it like no one go through something and we've got to be able to figure out what is approval that gets us to continue to reduce that and that they're in lines i think,9369.36,9375.44
"(9375.44, 9396.58)"," some of the challenges with that communication i mean yeah and then you, the, I know you guys are like far away from your, your water treatment facility, or your emergency water treatment.

"(10693.98, 10727.68)"," yourself should I go or should Ann no why don't you go ahead hi um I want to stay as positive as possible, and I'd like to focus on remediation as it was defined today that you just skim the top of the water the aquifer",10693.98,10727.68
"(10728.64, 10737.36)", everything from the top to the bottom is this is what's so confusing is the the condensation that,10728.64,10737.36
"(10737.36, 10745.0)", you that you're talking about to wipe or whatever the whole the whole land is the aquifer from the surface.,10737.36,10745.0
"(10745.0, 10755.0)"," So remediation will, in my mind, involve natural, not natural attenuation, which means to us doing nothing.",10745.0,10755.0
"(10755.0, 10766.28)", It means looking at indigenous microorganisms attenuated with those microorganisms that feed on the toxins.,10755.0,10766.28
"(10766.74, 10772.5)"," So we need an accounting of what has been brought into Hawaii,",10766.74,10772.5
"(10773.22, 10777.3)"," for example, PFAS and all of the array of other toxins",10773.22,10777.3

"(10788.32, 10797.04)", what we're going to do with all of these toxins because it is present when i look at for the past,10788.32,10797.04
"(10797.04, 10805.9)", eight years i'm looking at this whole system which um which has been going on for meeting after meeting after meeting.,10797.04,10805.9
"(10807.44, 10814.6)", These meetings don't work because we never actually address the issue,10807.44,10814.6

"(10822.38, 10826.2)", So what I'm going to say might go out into outer space and we won't,10822.38,10826.2
"(10826.2, 10833.78)"," continue this conversation. I believe that this system is not just the Navy system, but also",10826.2,10833.78
"(10833.78, 10842.32)"," on the Hawaii side, our system of not addressing each point. This is what caused the 2021 spill",10833.78,10842.32

"(11601.5, 11604.8)"," in the area I've seen over my 25 year career,",11601.5,11604.8
"(11604.8, 11605.76)", we'll be talking about even less amounts of water in the atmosphere in the area i've seen over my 25 year career we'll be talking about,11604.8,11605.76
"(11605.76, 11613.84)", even less amounts of water in the reservoir and speaking briefly with you know dam safety over,11605.76,11613.84
"(11613.84, 11618.96)", the years i've been working with them closely for many many years and you know we've been talking,11613.84,11618.96
"(11618.96, 11627.0)"," about this remediation of this magnitude would be anywhere from, you know, could be possibly from 12 to 15 million dollars.",11618.96,11627.0
"(11627.0, 11637.0)"," And for something like that to hold water 15% of the year, I know water is important, but for 15% of the year, that's just a tough pill to swallow for anyone.",11627.0,11637.0
"(11637.0, 11643.0)"," Is it an important reservoir? It is, but we've been able to function without it since 2007.",11637.0,11643.0
"(11643.0, 11646.24)"," We haven't operated it since 2007, and we've been able to function without it since 2007. We haven't operated it since 2007 and we've been able to",11643.0,11646.24
"(11646.24, 11650.8)", function without it and then you add the IIFS that's come in that's just even less water that's,11646.24,11650.8
"(11650.8, 11655.84)", available for the reservoir so we just felt that this was the time plus there are safety hazards,11650.8,11655.84
"(11655.84, 11660.72)", in there that could potentially get worse so we just felt like this was the time to address this,11655.84,11660.72
"(11660.72, 11668.24)", and so we came up with that with our own internal analysis yeah mark and i appreciate that,11660.72,11668.24
"(11668.24, 11674.24)", i think we totally understand that a lot of the private dams and reservoirs are a liability right,11668.24,11674.24
"(11674.24, 11680.64)", now for private landowners and i think we we're pushing at the legislature to understand that and,11674.24,11680.64
"(11680.64, 11693.0)", there has to be a modicum of public funding in partnership with private landowners to at least preserve the important reservoirs that offer a whole multitude of benefits.,11680.64,11693.0
"(11693.0, 11707.36)"," So I hope in your analysis, and I totally appreciate it from your perspective, that you keep that in mind and you can share with us like some of the factors that what would it take on the public side",11693.0,11707.36
"(11707.36, 11712.64)", to help you preserve this might not be the reservoir that we're talking about but i think,11707.36,11712.64
"(11712.64, 11718.96)", in the future there will be public funds available to try to partner with private landowners to be,11712.64,11718.96
"(11718.96, 11727.5)", able to restore and bring these reservoirs and dams back up to a level because they don't produce a lot of public benefits,11718.96,11727.5
"(11727.5, 11731.14)", in addition to potential water storage during dry times,11727.5,11731.14

"(11780.98, 11788.0)"," Well, I would check out Senate Bill 1066, and it does ask the Commission for next year",11780.98,11788.0
"(11788.0, 11794.34)", to come up with a priority list of capital improvement projects that include both public,11788.0,11794.34

"(11832.0, 11846.92)"," I first read stream diversion records and then I read dam, and those sort of confer different levels of hazard and risk to downstream communities. And so I wanted to better understand",11832.0,11846.92

"(11875.84, 11881.84)", address some of these questions again um so related to what's before you is when what we,11875.84,11881.84
"(11881.84, 11885.36)", have authority over is the stream diversion right and so in this,11881.84,11885.36
"(11885.36, 11892.56)", case the stream the dam itself is the what is diverting water and that's just the design and,11885.36,11892.56
"(11892.56, 11897.28)", how it was developed right so one of the permits that we require is stream diversion works,11892.56,11897.28
"(11897.28, 11902.4)", abandonment if you're going to you know formally abandon a permit in this case because it's also,11897.28,11902.4
"(11902.4, 11905.28)", a dam they have to comply with dam safety standards,11902.4,11905.28
"(11905.28, 11911.92)", and their application review process so what we're trying to do is make sure that on our books,11905.28,11911.92
"(11911.92, 11917.52)", the diversion is taken off it's no longer a diversion something that's allowed allowing,11911.92,11917.52
"(11917.52, 11925.2)"," the applicant to divert water um but on the dam safety side how how that's designed, how it manages the, you know,",11917.52,11925.2
"(11928.4, 11930.44)"," water flooding, etc.",11928.4,11930.44
"(11930.44, 11933.48)", That application is still in process based on what we understand.,11930.44,11933.48
"(11933.64, 11940.68)", So there's still going to be that process that DLNR and Dam Safety is going to look at in terms of managing,11933.64,11940.68
"(11942.24, 11944.16)", potential downstream impacts.,11942.24,11944.16
"(11944.16, 11946.2)"," We also submitted this to SHFTI,",11944.16,11946.2
"(11946.2, 11948.8)", but haven't received a response yet.,11946.2,11948.8

"(11958.78, 11961.52)"," And if the applicant is not happy with that,",11958.78,11961.52
"(11961.52, 11964.02)"," then we'd come back to the commission basically and say,",11961.52,11964.02
"(11964.02, 11970.0)"," here's the situation, this is what SHFTI is recommending. We're saying to, you know, add it as a condition.",11964.02,11970.0

"(11986.8, 11994.56)", requirements so that's my simple response to um where we're at um question so does engineering,11986.8,11994.56
"(11994.56, 12002.16)", division have regulatory oversight or they just they have regulatory oversight over the dam and,11994.56,12002.16
"(12002.16, 12025.0)"," how it's designed and dirty commission so they issue permits to do that and manage it and fine and have regulatory, so the board of land and natural resources manage and will manage that process. removal meets their requirements.",12002.16,12025.0
"(12025.38, 12027.48)"," I guess I'm worried that if we approve something,",12025.38,12027.48
"(12027.48, 12030.06)", but then we take on the liability in case,12027.48,12030.06
"(12030.06, 12032.48)", that it becomes a hazard.,12030.06,12032.48

"(12033.36, 12038.36)", So we're seeing these as parallel processes.,12033.36,12038.36
"(12039.1, 12039.94)", Right.,12039.1,12039.94
"(12039.94, 12041.78)", So that's the way I understand it.,12039.94,12041.78
"(12041.78, 12045.52)", I apologize that dam safety is not here,12041.78,12045.52
"(12045.52, 12047.08)", or engineering is not here.,12045.52,12047.08
"(12047.08, 12050.3)", And maybe I can ask Ryan who's online,12047.08,12050.3
"(12050.3, 12052.72)", to run down the hallway and see if we can get somebody,12050.3,12052.72

"(12067.12, 12071.44)", you know the applicant is here and is going through all of the regulatory requirements in,12067.12,12071.44
"(12071.44, 12076.32)", order to be compliant with the work that they're proposing um so you know maybe i don't know if,12071.44,12076.32
"(12076.32, 12081.52)", mark does have any additional information to share based on their conversation with dam safety but,12076.32,12081.52
"(12081.52, 12085.28)", from in our perspective we're coordinating on the water commission side dam,12081.52,12085.28
"(12085.28, 12091.04)", safety is we'll be reviewing it on the land board side which is purely within their authority and,12085.28,12091.04
"(12091.04, 12099.04)", regulatory review yeah um yeah we've been working with dam safety for quite a while,12091.04,12099.04
"(12099.6, 12107.92)"," on the removal of this and you know meeting all of the requirements and their criteria, design criteria, restoration criteria,",12099.6,12107.92
"(12107.92, 12109.12)", all of that.,12107.92,12109.12

"(12126.96, 12129.44)", SHIPTE would have something to to add about that,12126.96,12129.44
"(12135.44, 12149.92)", okay anything Aurora do you have anything tag on to following up with that comment mark under the,12135.44,12149.92
"(12149.92, 12158.56)", engineering and the abandonment uh with working with engineering on the dam safety site what is,12149.92,12158.56
"(12159.2, 12168.0)", what is going to be physically done are you going to have to you know because i'm thinking about environmental,12159.2,12168.0
"(12168.0, 12175.84)", impacts because because water commission is saying there's no ea trigger but i'm wondering,12168.0,12175.84
"(12175.84, 12190.0)", you know is there a trigger at the dam safety side that's a great question. So dam safety gives us the requirements to complete removal of the embankment.,12175.84,12190.0
"(12190.0, 12198.0)", And they do flow dynamic studies to decide the width of the breach in the actual removal.,12190.0,12198.0
"(12198.0, 12205.44)", So we have to take out the entire embankment that has to be removed off site and then all of the sedimentation has to be protected,12198.0,12205.44
"(12205.44, 12211.52)", and the stream bed has to be protected with um just thousands of yards of riprap just large,12205.44,12211.52
"(12211.52, 12215.6)", boulders and rocks that are placed along the bottom to keep the sediment from flowing out,12211.52,12215.6
"(12216.48, 12221.52)", there's embankment restoration on either side of the stream banks that has to take place so that,12216.48,12221.52
"(12221.52, 12226.72)", we minimize any downstream you know impacts along the way it it's,12221.52,12226.72
"(12226.72, 12233.36)", a whole transformation of basically it's as best as possible restoring everything to what it was,12226.72,12233.36
"(12233.36, 12240.4)", prior to this dam being built in 1885 that's the goal of dam safety is obviously the safety but,12233.36,12240.4
"(12240.4, 12246.4)", then also the restoration ecologically the restoration and the entire waterway being,12240.4,12246.4
"(12246.4, 12252.56)"," restored to, you know, pre-contact. I shouldn't say pre-contact, but pre-erection of the dam",12246.4,12252.56
"(12252.56, 12253.56)", itself.,12252.56,12253.56
"(12253.56, 12261.42)"," That might be pre-contact. I'm just joking, I'm just joking. But do you know whether they're",12253.56,12261.42
"(12261.42, 12265.38)", going to require an environmental assessment be completed?,12261.42,12265.38
"(12266.7, 12266.78)", I don't know.,12266.7,12266.78
"(12268.52, 12269.38)", I don't believe so.,12268.52,12269.38
"(12277.86, 12277.94)"," I think just the whole, I'm not sure we went through this before with them on Kapakalua Dam, and that wasn't required for that.",12277.86,12277.94
"(12284.76, 12284.96)"," But again, I've been given a list of, we were given a list of the requirements, and we didn't see that on the requirements.",12284.76,12284.96
"(12285.28, 12289.68)", That may be a question for them safety though yeah we'll check with them prior to coming to the board,12285.28,12289.68
"(12289.68, 12295.52)", because i'm just thinking i mean that's a lot of the restoration of the embankment you're moving a,12289.68,12295.52
"(12295.52, 12305.88)", lot of potential dirt or soil and putting rocks there must be some there may there might be some impact so okay that may be a more relevant question,12295.52,12305.88
"(12305.88, 12316.08)", to engineering department than to seaworm because before us Khalil is only the abandonment of the,12305.88,12316.08
"(12316.08, 12328.66)"," stream diversion right so in this case it's it's kind of not awkward, but there's overlap, right? Where what is the thing that is diverting water is a dam.",12316.08,12328.66
"(12329.36, 12331.58)"," I mean, it functions as that.",12329.36,12331.58
"(12331.58, 12333.14)"," And most of diversions do too,",12331.58,12333.14
"(12333.14, 12336.42)", but sometimes we just have a pipe or a pump,12333.14,12336.42
"(12336.42, 12338.46)", that's located in the stream.,12336.42,12338.46

"(12340.8, 12343.58)", and this is ultimately tied to follow-ups,12340.8,12343.58
"(12343.58, 12345.6)", of abandonment of diversions for,12343.58,12345.6

"(12407.36, 12408.52)", and then you remove a reservoir,12407.36,12408.52

"(12462.24, 12470.74)", a fairly long period of record that whether it's USGS or any sort of engineering model,12462.24,12470.74

"(12493.58, 12506.8)", The dam itself was only 100 million gallon so even currently the the peak flow that would,12493.58,12506.8
"(12506.8, 12514.88)", occur every other year would still be over topping the existing structure so the fact that we are um,12506.8,12514.88
"(12514.88, 12525.84)", getting rid of it isn't going to affect the the regularity with which the high flow events are making it past the dam.,12514.88,12525.84
"(12527.84, 12529.32)", Does that answer your question?,12527.84,12529.32
"(12531.44, 12535.4)", So that's the periodicity. Like now you don't have this hundred million gallon buffer.,12531.44,12535.4
"(12535.96, 12540.8)", So you actually are going to increase maybe the frequency of like,12535.96,12540.8

"(12546.06, 12547.96)", And I guess I just wanna better understand.,12546.06,12547.96
"(12547.96, 12551.48)"," Well, so there are still upstream diversions",12547.96,12551.48

"(12631.22, 12638.64)"," Because now you have no release, even if you had 100 million gallon storage that somehow",12631.22,12638.64

"(12641.24, 12646.88)"," So does that, how does that impact those diversions and those users",12641.24,12646.88
"(12648.64, 12656.16)", so what uh i understand about the watershed is that all of the divergence downstream are,12648.64,12656.16
"(12656.16, 12667.36)", owned or operated by east maui irrigation so how they manage their system whether they release water from the reservoir or not it would only,12656.16,12667.36
"(12667.36, 12675.68)", be impacting themselves is is that what you're asking like what is the implication for downstream,12667.36,12675.68
"(12675.68, 12685.0)", users yes yeah so it would I don't see it as being consequential.,12675.68,12685.0
"(12686.96, 12689.92)"," And so during peak flows,",12686.96,12689.92
"(12691.5, 12693.0)"," the attenuation of the flows,",12691.5,12693.0
"(12693.0, 12698.0)", how does it affect downstream users or facilities,12693.0,12698.0
"(12698.06, 12701.22)"," at the stream mouth, for example?",12698.06,12701.22

"(12711.68, 12742.0)"," EMI themselves. It's private property as far as I know. The larger flood events say the one in 10 year flood that is now occurring more regularly as expecting with climate change.

"(12742.0, 12749.28)", So that we're not we we don't predict that removal of the dam is,12742.0,12749.28
"(12749.28, 12756.24)", going to substantially affect the magnitude or the frequency of the high flow those major flooding,12749.28,12756.24
"(12756.24, 12763.44)", events and and you said the emi manages low flow events so that's not an issue as well for them,12756.24,12763.44
"(12763.44, 12767.5)", yeah and of course division is going to go through all this analysis as well.,12763.44,12767.5

"(12808.32, 12817.6)", And somebody spent a fair amount of money to build it in the first place is that need prospectively non-existent today in other words is there no,12808.32,12817.6
"(12817.6, 12827.84)", reason for that additional storage storage by the way is very expensive to build you know that and this dam if it was reconstructed,12817.6,12827.84
"(12827.84, 12834.72)", today from scratch would probably be uh impossibly expensive to build um is it something that is,12827.84,12834.72
"(12834.72, 12842.72)", really unnecessary prospectively for the future as a storage device so we took all that into account,12834.72,12842.72

"(13160.94, 13174.52)", a permit or not a permit for the removal of the dam I would think that analysis would say you know what is the effect on traditional Hawaiian practices if kalo is restored,13160.94,13174.52
"(13174.52, 13181.24)", here and there's a big storm event have we planned for that do has that been taken into account so,13174.52,13181.24
"(13181.24, 13186.66)", I'm not saying that um you know it's your responsibility but I'm saying that this,13181.24,13186.66

"(14125.12, 14133.04)", of timeline differing from you know a month or two to do specific outreach to some of the people,14125.12,14133.04
"(14133.04, 14138.16)", recommended commitment schools if they are a downstream landowner now then you know just,14133.04,14138.16
"(14138.16, 14142.24)", checking in with them if they have any comments on the application department of transportation,14138.16,14142.24
"(14142.24, 14146.72)", based on cr clubs comments about whether or not the flood,14142.24,14146.72
"(14146.72, 14154.16)", you know the drainage um in the road is sufficient to handle additional flows um mark i i for for,14146.72,14154.16
"(14154.16, 14160.24)", staff i i'm comfortable with kind of taking a a quick pause but i need to check in with,14154.16,14160.24
"(14160.24, 14165.0)", the applicant if there's any critical time frames.,14160.24,14165.0
"(14165.0, 14169.0)"," I think, first of all, I think I want to address the Department of Trans.",14165.0,14169.0
"(14169.0, 14173.0)", We had extensive consultation with the Department of Trans.,14169.0,14173.0
"(14173.0, 14185.72)"," We ran the required design flows that they asked us to run through that watershed, and they were the ones who said, yes, you guys are okay to move ahead. And the cover that we do have in place at the highway",14173.0,14185.72
"(14185.72, 14188.04)", is sufficient to take the design plot that they gave us.,14185.72,14188.04
"(14188.04, 14189.56)", So we did go through DOT.,14188.04,14189.56
"(14190.44, 14193.36)"," As far as delaying it, I mean, in an ideal world,",14190.44,14193.36
"(14193.36, 14195.6)"," I think we are sitting on the SHIPDI,",14193.36,14195.6
"(14199.28, 14201.98)"," as anyone knows that sometimes can be a lengthy review,",14199.28,14201.98
"(14201.98, 14203.84)"," but it's good because they do, you know,",14201.98,14203.84
"(14203.84, 14210.32)", they do turn over all the stones. think that's something that um justin could definitely reach out to shipi to make,14203.84,14210.32
"(14210.32, 14214.56)", those concerns known because i think she has some very valid points there and i think those should,14210.32,14214.56
"(14214.56, 14227.36)", be addressed or at least at least reviewed i guess i want to address kind of a procedural issue and mark um and maybe mark and khalil in my view,14214.56,14227.36
"(14229.44, 14234.0)", from the commission standpoint we we actually have the constitutional obligation,14229.44,14234.0
"(14234.64, 14240.16)", article 12 section 7. but that's based upon the information that's presented to us,14234.64,14240.16
"(14241.44, 14251.12)", i do not believe that that is a kuleana of our staff to go and gather that information in my mind,14241.44,14251.12
"(14251.12, 14259.2)", that is the kuleana of the applicant to provide us with sufficient information to make that analysis,14251.12,14259.2
"(14260.0, 14267.52)", so i guess i am proposing something a little different mark can you guys who is you are the,14260.0,14267.52
"(14267.52, 14275.36)", applicant can you go talk story with jocelyn and see if you can address some of her concerns,14267.52,14275.36
"(14275.36, 14288.72)", that that is part of your application to us rather than having our staff go and do because I do see what Jocelyn is raising is separate and a part of the SHPD.,14275.36,14288.72
"(14289.28, 14296.32)", SHPD is kind of like historic preservation. This is kapa'a kai analysis which to me it is,14289.28,14296.32
"(14296.88, 14309.44)", identifying what those resources may be and the potential impact. But mark is that something that you emi can go and follow up on ultimately if,14296.88,14309.44
"(14309.44, 14318.56)", the if our goal is to decommission this dam and it's going to affect um something that you know,14309.44,14318.56
"(14318.56, 14326.0)", the downstream that just feels very strongly about then yes of course i will talk to jason about this I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point.,14318.56,14326.0
"(14326.0, 14328.0)", I think that's a great point.,14326.0,14328.0
"(14328.0, 14330.0)", I think that's a great point.,14328.0,14330.0
"(14330.0, 14332.0)", I think that's a great point.,14330.0,14332.0
"(14332.0, 14334.0)", I think that's a great point.,14332.0,14334.0
"(14334.0, 14336.0)", I think that's a great point.,14334.0,14336.0
"(14336.0, 14338.0)", I think that's a great point.,14336.0,14338.0
"(14338.0, 14340.0)", I think that's a great point.,14338.0,14340.0
"(14340.0, 14342.0)", I think that's a great point.,14340.0,14342.0
"(14342.0, 14344.0)", I think that's a great point.,14342.0,14344.0
"(14344.0, 14345.7)", I think that's a great point. I think that's a great point. if we don't have enough information then we shouldn't take action but so I appreciate I,14344.0,14345.7
"(14345.7, 14352.6)", appreciate Mark that you guys you know you go and follow up on that makes sense commissioners,14345.7,14352.6
"(14354.34, 14360.4)", so that sounds like a deferral like go talk to them and then come and then bring this back yeah,14354.34,14360.4
"(14360.4, 14387.44)"," the other option that I thought was here uh is is to say here we approve it. If you get concurrence of ship D and if you want to add a whole book or something else we could we could condition that way we don't need to see it touch again if if the concurrence is there. No, I see what you're saying, Neil, I guess for me, and it is sort of addressing Lucy Ann's comment.",14360.4,14387.44
"(14388.62, 14396.04)", I don't want to delegate Kapa'akai to SHPD. Okay. I think that is our kuleana as a commission.,14388.62,14396.04
"(14396.62, 14433.0)"," And I think it is giving us information to make that assessment. So my preference would be that you know, Mark, you tell us when you're ready to come back. I mean, this this reservoir has been abandoned for quite some time. I suspect one one month or two months may not make that much of a difference. I hope I'm I hope that's true. But it'll give you guys time to go out and talk story. And you know, for me, that is more appropriate that we have the landowner talking story with these families who have a connection.",14396.62,14433.0
"(14433.58, 14442.6)"," Because it is that relationship much more than in my mind, that should not be the Juliana of our staff to do that.",14433.58,14442.6
"(14442.6, 14446.06)", Because I don't think we should be accepting,14442.6,14446.06
"(14446.06, 14449.96)", that responsibility on behalf of the applicant.,14446.06,14449.96
"(14449.96, 14453.96)"," And I think SHPD, I wouldn't want to delegate to them",14449.96,14453.96
"(14453.96, 14454.8)", that assessment.,14453.96,14454.8
"(14454.8, 14456.88)"," So if the commission is okay,",14454.8,14456.88
"(14456.88, 14459.72)", I would prefer that the applicant mark.,14456.88,14459.72
"(14459.72, 14461.64)", I see Aurora's hand now.,14459.72,14461.64
"(14461.64, 14462.48)", Go ahead.,14461.64,14462.48
"(14463.46, 14488.76)"," Yeah, no, I think that's really important is to have that dialogue. But then in the future there might be settings where an applicant has a vested kapaa'akai analysis? Is it complete? Has it met?",14463.46,14488.76
"(14489.06, 14499.68)"," You know, are we doing more than just citing an oral history, but speaking to the living, practicing practitioners are here today? So I don't want to like seed the staff's",14489.06,14499.68
"(14500.14, 14506.12)", role in this because they have so much experience with multiple applications but I agree with you,14500.14,14506.12
"(14506.12, 14515.84)", like we don't want to prevent direct communication yeah no no I I appreciate that I mean I think,14506.12,14515.84
"(14516.5, 14526.0)", in my mind from a legal standpoint that um staff can do the assessment based upon the information provided.,14516.5,14526.0
"(14526.0, 14532.0)"," So if there is not enough information, they should let us know that, or we can make that assessment.",14526.0,14532.0
"(14532.0, 14541.0)"," Or like these public meetings, I really appreciated Jocelyn's comments, because we thought we had contacted Ahamoku,",14532.0,14541.0
"(14541.0, 14550.5)"," and apparently Jocelyn didn't get the information. So to me, this public platform provides the opportunity for the community to tell us,",14541.0,14550.5
"(14550.92, 14556.14)"," you know what, you don't have enough information and then we can make the assessment to defer.",14550.92,14556.14
"(14556.14, 14561.56)"," Because what I don't want to see us happen is that, you know,",14556.14,14561.56
"(14561.56, 14567.0)", we're putting that burden on the staff to go out there and do the research.,14561.56,14567.0
"(14567.0, 14572.0)", We should be. We should be reviewing the information that is presented to us.,14567.0,14572.0
"(14572.0, 14583.0)"," If we feel there's not enough information, then to me I don't have I don't have a problem legally saying I cannot fulfill my constitutional obligation.",14572.0,14583.0
"(14583.0, 14587.0)", Therefore i'm gonna have to deny the application.,14583.0,14587.0
"(14587.0, 14601.0)"," I hope we don't have to do that but again I don't want to place that burden on our staff, because then that shifts in my mind it's just the legal burden from the applicant to now see where I'm staff to do.",14587.0,14601.0
"(14601.0, 14606.0)"," Does that make sense, Michael I see your hand up. I know work this this mark.",14601.0,14606.0
"(14606.0, 14611.0)", I appreciate you being in this conversation is so much more broader than just this application.,14606.0,14611.0
"(14611.0, 14626.12)"," But Michael, go ahead. You have your hand was up. Yeah, I have no problem with the deferral, as we try to get better relationships with restoration",14611.0,14626.12
"(14626.12, 14627.54)", of dams and reservoirs.,14626.12,14627.54
"(14627.54, 14633.1)", We have three different divisions in our department that are involved and we need to really kind,14627.54,14633.1
"(14633.1, 14636.16)", of coalesce and get kind of more organized.,14633.1,14636.16
"(14636.16, 14641.82)", And so we can communicate the landowners either restoring or removing dams that the department,14636.16,14641.82
"(14641.82, 14646.08)", can have a much more coordinated approach rather than having them,14641.82,14646.08
"(14646.08, 14652.0)", step through all three different division approvals that's a good point and i'm i mean i,14646.08,14652.0
"(14652.0, 14658.88)", think that point is well taken as a chairperson you're right i mean you know we should be we,14652.0,14658.88
"(14658.88, 14664.24)", should be facilitating that coordinated effort especially when landowners are you know rather,14658.88,14664.24
"(14664.24, 14667.08)"," than having them go through so many different hoops,",14664.24,14667.08

"(14672.86, 14675.14)", So point is well taken.,14672.86,14675.14
"(14675.14, 14678.04)", I think we will work on that.,14675.14,14678.04

"(14682.04, 14686.58)", So clearly we will do better internally.,14682.04,14686.58
"(14688.88, 14690.52)", Any other questions?,14688.88,14690.52
"(14691.8, 14696.0)"," So what I sense is, do I need a motion?",14691.8,14696.0

"(15587.68, 15596.64)", for staff on item b2 michael yeah uh clay or some of the response uh are we removing the abandoned,15587.68,15596.64
"(15597.52, 15608.56)", pipes and concrete from the stream channel i'm not sure if that's a condition in exhibit four or not uh the way that,15597.52,15608.56
"(15608.56, 15617.6)", from what i understand yes the stream as one one item one says remove pipes and concrete from,15608.56,15617.6
"(15617.6, 15625.22)"," the west cavela stream so yes that's what's being proposed okay Okay, there seems to be,",15617.6,15625.22
"(15625.22, 15627.18)", I don't know if there's confusion or that's something,15625.22,15627.18
"(15627.18, 15630.92)"," just the public testimony wasn't unsure of,",15627.18,15630.92
"(15630.92, 15634.3)"," but we should make sure we're really clear about that,",15630.92,15634.3
"(15634.3, 15639.3)", at least in our minutes at a minimum.,15634.3,15639.3
"(15640.18, 15642.36)"," Okay, thank you for the clarification.",15640.18,15642.36
"(15642.36, 15645.92)"," Yeah, the intent of that is to remove basically get rid",15642.36,15645.92
"(15645.92, 15651.28)", of the abandoned diversion and remove the pipes and the concrete from the stream itself,15645.92,15651.28
"(15652.48, 15656.88)", yeah especially one more comment you know we have so much rare opportunities to actually restore,15652.48,15656.88
"(15656.88, 15665.04)", streams uh and and this is the one on molokai that we picked so I think it's really important in this context thank you,15656.88,15665.04
"(15669.6, 15674.32)", any other questions or comments from the commissioners I don't see any hands up,15669.6,15674.32
"(15674.32, 15681.04)", I'm going to now move to public comment or applicant yeah I'm sorry they want to ask,15674.32,15681.04
"(15681.04, 15686.16)", um is the applicant representative here,15681.04,15686.16
"(15695.2, 15700.96)", hi chair this is cal chip chase i'm sorry for appearing indeed chair indeed uh with with me too is uh todd svetin with molokai ranch and uh harold edwards with itc our consultant and,15695.2,15700.96
"(15700.96, 15706.16)", contractor uh helping us with these matters apologize for appearing by phone if,15700.96,15706.16
"(15706.16, 15712.32)", i get to a stable spot i can turn on my video we we um we shared a long day with the commission,15706.16,15712.32
"(15712.32, 15717.44)", maybe not in person but remotely and uh and it went a little longer than i anticipated and so,15712.32,15717.44
"(15717.44, 15728.24)", i'm between places uh but we support the staff's recommendation as amended by deputy director today and we're just available for any questions the Commission may have.,15717.44,15728.24
"(15729.6, 15733.5)"," Thank you very much, Commissioners, do you have any questions for the applicant?",15729.6,15733.5
"(15735.82, 15737.74)"," I do have one question, Chair.",15735.82,15737.74
"(15739.38, 15742.68)"," How long, I know the actual permit for the",15739.38,15742.68
"(15744.1, 15747.0)", diversion I think was,15744.1,15747.0
"(15747.0, 15753.0)", 1989. How long is is the ranch been utilizing this diversion?,15747.0,15753.0
"(15753.0, 15757.0)"," All right, Commissioner, I'll invite either Todd or Harold.",15753.0,15757.0
"(15757.0, 15766.1)"," Harold also has a long history with the ranch to to provide that information probably more accurately than I can. I mean, I have to guess it's probably",15757.0,15766.1
"(15766.1, 15768.46)", in the neighborhood of 80 years or more.,15766.1,15768.46
"(15768.46, 15770.32)", I think there's been around quite some time.,15768.46,15770.32
"(15776.8, 15777.52)", All right.,15776.8,15777.52
"(15777.52, 15779.24)"," Paul, did I see your hand up?",15777.52,15779.24
"(15783.12, 15789.0)"," No. Commissioner, does anybody else have any questions for the applicant?",15783.12,15789.0
"(15789.0, 15799.0)"," Quick one. Yes, go ahead. or so it looks like this is pretty easy work to take out.",15789.0,15799.0
"(15799.0, 15808.0)", It does that include plans of I mean do you guys have to hike in or fly in and and does it include plans to completely remove it from the site?,15799.0,15808.0
"(15808.0, 15818.0)", It'll be a matter of hiking in and everything will be moved away from the the stream bed and started some appropriate place off site.,15808.0,15818.0
"(15818.0, 15826.8)"," Okay, Well, I mean i've had to fly out concrete blocks from my car as part of my CDP and so I just you know that was one of the concerns raised",15818.0,15826.8
"(15826.8, 15832.56)", in written testimonies so I think just being clear that that that's part of the um the plan,15826.8,15832.56
"(15832.56, 15835.84)", is helpful like commissioner mentioned so thanks,15832.56,15835.84
"(15841.12, 15849.0)", any other questions from the commissioners or the applicant before I open it up for public comments?,15841.12,15849.0
"(15849.0, 15860.0)"," So, Harold, just I'm sorry, Chair. I was just going to say, Harold, when when you say offsite, you mean out of the stream area for possible use in a reactivation of another location.",15849.0,15860.0
"(15860.0, 15870.08)", I just want to make sure that we are clear with the commission in light of the public testimony yeah thank you that clarification correct yeah um and khalil can i ask because,15860.0,15870.08
"(15870.08, 15876.56)", it's not one of the conditions the removal off site it doesn't say it yeah what our recommendation,15870.08,15876.56
"(15876.56, 15887.82)"," again because our priority is the diversion and within the stream channel um that's where we focus on. If based on testimony and the conversation,",15876.56,15887.82
"(15887.82, 15891.86)"," new folks want to recommend that could be taken off site,",15887.82,15891.86
"(15891.86, 15893.38)", then that's fine.,15891.86,15893.38
"(15893.38, 15896.12)", That's not within what we're recommending.,15893.38,15896.12
"(15896.12, 15899.2)", We're just focusing on removing the actual diversion,15896.12,15899.2
"(15899.2, 15901.96)", from the stream and the pipe out of the stream,15899.2,15901.96
"(15901.96, 15903.78)"," so it can no longer divert water, right?",15901.96,15903.78
"(15903.78, 15910.64)", That's within the purview of this body the water commission so i know that there was um i kind of jumping that gun i think,15903.78,15910.64
"(15910.64, 15917.6)", there's testifiers so maybe we can address that after everyone testifies very good so with that,15910.64,15917.6
"(15917.6, 15929.8)", being said i'm going to open it up for public testimony i do do have several people who are here to provide oral testimony. Is it Darlene,15917.6,15929.8
"(15929.8, 15937.18)"," Matsuoka? Chair, Doreen is with my office. She was going to present with me, actually maybe in",15929.8,15937.18
"(15937.18, 15942.06)"," place of me, but she had to catch a flight to Kauai for another matter, and I'm on my way to",15937.18,15942.06
"(15942.06, 15949.82)"," join her. So you're stuck with me this afternoon, that's not so bad thank you very much Cal for that clarification um",15942.06,15949.82
"(15949.82, 15961.14)", Riddhi are you there um so chair this is Mahesh Cleveland um I can speak for,15949.82,15961.14
"(15961.14, 15967.22)", right now uh but many of the members of Moloka Inoka Heke,15961.14,15967.22
"(15967.22, 15969.64)", that had signed up to submit testimony this morning,15967.22,15969.64
"(15969.64, 15971.88)"," had other kuleana in the afternoon,",15969.64,15971.88
"(15971.88, 15973.8)", and the rest of them that had kuleana in the morning,15971.88,15973.8
"(15973.8, 15975.92)", didn't sign up and aren't with us this afternoon.,15973.8,15975.92
"(15975.92, 15980.34)"," And so, unfortunately, this is a unintentional side effect",15975.92,15980.34
"(15980.34, 15981.92)"," of flipping the agenda around like that,",15980.34,15981.92
"(15981.92, 15984.56)", is you folks aren't gonna hear all the public testimony,15981.92,15984.56
"(15984.56, 15986.0)", that would have come in otherwise.,15984.56,15986.0
"(15986.0, 16014.16)"," But there are other members, and I can I can just take my turn when it comes up. go ahead hi aloha sorry i can't see myself in the picture but",15986.0,16014.16
"(16014.16, 16018.02)", is this okay can you hear me yes yes we can hear you clearly,16014.16,16018.02
"(16018.02, 16029.92)", okay yeah my name is tiavihin um we we're good yeah okay born and raised in cavella,16018.02,16029.92
"(16030.56, 16039.28)", um and a member of molokai and i can speak for myself and also all those who are here to testify,16030.56,16039.28
"(16039.28, 16047.68)", that my has just mentioned can no longer sit here and testify unfortunately um my pilina with cavella started,16039.28,16047.68
"(16048.56, 16052.72)", basically when i was born our father built our home there in the early 70s and,16048.56,16052.72
"(16052.72, 16059.04)", we have called this our home ever since the river is basically our backyard um and like any home,16052.72,16059.04
"(16059.04, 16066.18)"," owner you know we like to keep our area clean our our environment safe, welcoming, healthy.",16059.04,16066.18
"(16066.18, 16070.78)"," And so I really believe that, well, first of all, I commend Molokai Property Limited",16066.18,16070.78
"(16070.78, 16075.64)", for taking the action to rectify the mess.,16070.78,16075.64
"(16075.64, 16082.58)"," I do feel though, before the permit is granted, that we should clarify what they mean by removal.",16075.64,16082.58
"(16082.58, 16087.2)", I don't think removing it to another location in the forest or reorganizing,16082.58,16087.2
"(16087.2, 16093.52)", it or rearranging it is what we asking for. We asking for removal of these old pipes and,16087.2,16093.52
"(16093.52, 16099.5)", these old diversion materials to be moved out of the forest or properly disposed of as most of them,16093.52,16099.5
"(16099.5, 16105.98)", are not probably not reusable. And I feel like this is a small request in the right direction.,16099.5,16105.98
"(16105.98, 16113.0)"," And yeah, just one more step to getting Kavela fully restored. Mahalo.",16105.98,16113.0
"(16113.0, 16130.4)"," Mahalo for that. I appreciate that. Is it, I'm going to mispronounce it. Is it now? Rapa pronounce it is and now wrap a knot no I know I do apologize Mahesh that you know we did we",16113.0,16130.4
"(16130.96, 16139.52)", we moved up the agenda items but I'm hoping you'll be able to provide us testimony that is consistent,16130.96,16139.52
"(16139.52, 16145.58)", with what those who are not able to be here. So I have Lana Corpus.,16139.52,16145.58
"(16146.9, 16147.18)"," No,",16146.9,16147.18
"(16147.56, 16151.0)", Lana is another one of the Moloka'ino Kahake members that,16147.56,16151.0
"(16151.04, 16152.66)", had to attend to other kuleana.,16151.04,16152.66

"(16157.52, 16163.64)", Okay. And I'll note that there are a couple other folks around,16157.52,16163.64
"(16163.64, 16168.1)", now who didn't sign up and they might be able to speak up.,16163.64,16168.1
"(16168.1, 16171.16)"," But anyway, good morning, Chair Chang,",16168.1,16171.16

"(16176.72, 16177.88)", so I'll introduce myself.,16176.72,16177.88
"(16177.88, 16179.72)", My name is Mahesh Cleveland.,16177.88,16179.72
"(16179.72, 16183.1)"," I'm an attorney with the Honolulu Office of Earth Justice,",16179.72,16183.1
"(16183.1, 16186.42)", and we represent Moloka'iai no Kaheke since we filed,16183.1,16186.42
"(16186.42, 16194.82)"," their 2019 petition to amend flow standards for these central Molokai streams, prevent further",16186.42,16194.82
"(16194.82, 16206.24)"," waste of water resources by MPL's uses and relevant to this proceeding, ask that the ranch be compelled to go through the formal abandonment processes",16194.82,16206.24
"(16206.24, 16212.64)", for the specific purpose of of cleaning up many of the derelict pipes that are left unused now,16206.24,16212.64
"(16213.28, 16220.8)", the two uh diversions in question today west cavella and east cavella tributary have both been,16213.28,16220.8
"(16221.36, 16227.36)", defunct and unused for many years um they went in a long time ago uh and and they've,16221.36,16227.36
"(16227.36, 16236.48)", sat there unused uh since they were turned off i think um by the time we submitted our written,16227.36,16236.48
"(16236.48, 16242.32)", testimony and i also hope that the commission received our supplemental uh letter last night,16236.48,16242.32
"(16242.32, 16268.32)"," that just had some some pictures sort of showing how the west cavella and east cavella pipes sort Justin Delacruz, CA OSDS, he's the one who's been working on this, and he's been working on this for a long time, and he's been working on this for a long time, and he's been working on this for a long time. on-site storage for disposal because I think to most people the idea of storage conflicts directly",16242.32,16268.32
"(16268.32, 16275.16)", with the idea of disposal and since Moloka'i and Okaheke is one of the main initial reasons for,16268.32,16275.16
"(16275.16, 16282.38)", pursuing this was to get them to clean up the mess and because the commission actually it's,16275.16,16282.38
"(16282.38, 16290.78)", been almost exactly a year to the day commissioners who were here last year when the commission actually it's it's been almost exactly a year to the day commissioners who were here last year when when the commission uh first decided to restore cavella and address a few of,16282.38,16290.78
"(16290.78, 16296.26)", these issues but a year ago the commission asked that these uh diversions be formally abandoned,16290.78,16296.26
"(16296.26, 16308.64)"," for among other reasons to to improve the aesthetic uh and environmental qualities of those streams. And so there's, since we submitted testimony,",16296.26,16308.64
"(16309.04, 16312.78)", I was able to get some further clarity,16309.04,16312.78
"(16312.78, 16316.2)", from Ms. Matsuoka representing MPL.,16312.78,16316.2
"(16316.84, 16318.6)"," And as Mr. Chipchase mentioned,",16316.84,16318.6
"(16319.14, 16323.5)", I believe the plan is to cut these pipes,16319.14,16323.5
"(16323.5, 16329.04)", into manageable sizes. And any of them that can potentially be reused,16323.5,16329.04
"(16329.04, 16335.92)", might be stockpiled for future reuse but what I wanted to point out is that the watershed the,16329.04,16335.92
"(16335.92, 16348.12)", cavella watershed where these pipes currently sit is is is not is not the same watershed as the intakes that they are considering for potential future reactivation.,16335.92,16348.12
"(16348.66, 16356.12)"," The Komoku intake, which Ms. Matsuoka mentioned specifically, is actually the next watershed or two over.",16348.66,16356.12
"(16357.06, 16362.8)"," And so in order to get those pipes from the Kavela watershed over to the Komoku intake,",16357.06,16362.8
"(16362.8, 16369.0)", they would have to carry them up out of that Valley and move them down the road anyhow.,16362.8,16369.0
"(16369.0, 16387.08)", And so I think a really easy solution might be that Mpl has a facility a little bit further down the road where the various intake pipes diverting the various streams converge into a warehouse and over there seems like would be,16369.0,16387.08
"(16387.08, 16395.9)", sort of a logical place to store discarded or I should say reusable unused pipes and any pieces,16387.08,16395.9
"(16395.9, 16401.72)", of those pipes that could not be reused should then just be thrown in a truck and taken down,16395.9,16401.72
"(16401.72, 16410.88)", the hill to dispose of properly and so I I also wanted to mention that if you look at the pictures of the two different,16401.72,16410.88
"(16410.88, 16416.78)"," intake pipelines, you'll see that the West Covella pipe is a large black ABS pipe that",16410.88,16416.78
"(16416.78, 16421.98)", is strung along a steel cable that runs right up the middle of the West Covella gully.,16416.78,16421.98
"(16422.9, 16427.04)", Whereas the East Covella tributary supply pipe actually,16422.9,16427.04
"(16427.04, 16434.14)", runs along the access trail from the main East Covella dam around to the East Covella tributary,16427.04,16434.14
"(16434.14, 16439.8)"," intake. And so the vast bulk of that pipe, which appears to be quite a bit longer than the West",16434.14,16439.8
"(16439.8, 16445.78)"," Covella one, are actually not within the stream bed, but instead are just laying along the access trail",16439.8,16445.78
"(16445.78, 16449.44)", and i'll tell you from personal experience there's a couple spots in that trail a little hairy,16445.78,16449.44
"(16449.44, 16454.26)", the thought of stepping on a a piece of pipe in fact there's two old pipes running through there,16449.44,16454.26
"(16454.26, 16458.28)", the fact of the the idea of stepping on a piece of pipe while you're trying to navigate that that,16454.26,16458.28
"(16458.28, 16468.0)", access is is a little bit hairy and and you know i'll also mention that on various many occasions that Moka Inoka Heke has gone up to visit these sites.,16458.28,16468.0
"(16468.0, 16486.96)"," We have in fact seen conservation workers research teams accessing these various areas to check on the damsel flies, the native plants, and all the other things that the commission said we should clean up these intakes to protect and so um these are remote trails but they are frequently accessed",16468.0,16486.96
"(16486.96, 16493.52)", and well known not only to folks like dr strauch and other researchers but also to the molokai,16486.96,16493.52
"(16493.52, 16498.56)", community who regularly go up there uh even when we go they'll stop on the side of the road you,16493.52,16498.56
"(16498.56, 16508.7)", know pick some mamaki pick some lehua get some seeds to go plant down makai to restore native plants and so the the bottom line is is that,16498.56,16508.7
"(16508.7, 16515.7)", it doesn't make a lot of sense to say that we just need to detach some pipes that are in the,16508.7,16515.7
"(16515.7, 16521.72)", actual stream bed and then we can just leave the pipes on site in the same watershed where we know,16515.7,16521.72

"(17078.72, 17090.0)", to bring it right back down um so this is common sense and I can't believe that the Water Commission has to order Npl to pick up their own rubbish.,17078.72,17090.0

"(17384.38, 17392.0)", and it's a significant effort to get back out of there with with uh materials and and harold this is cal again and,17384.38,17392.0
"(17392.0, 17396.64)", sorry for jumping in share hill had mentioned that little garbled so i i just wanted to invite,17392.0,17396.64
"(17396.64, 17406.9)"," harold to further comment on the potential to reuse if uh kimoko is reactivated. Yeah, the black pipe that was referred to earlier",17396.64,17406.9
"(17406.9, 17411.82)"," is HTPE pipe, and it could be pulled into,",17406.9,17411.82
"(17411.82, 17413.74)"," cut into smaller lengths to be handled,",17411.82,17413.74
"(17413.74, 17417.58)", and then refused and used quite happily one ridge over rather,17413.74,17417.58
"(17417.58, 17420.1)", than taking it all the way out and having to pack it all,17417.58,17420.1
"(17420.1, 17424.66)", the way back in when the time came to hopefully reactivate,17420.1,17424.66
"(17424.66, 17425.52)", the Comoko intake,17424.66,17425.52
"(17429.6, 17436.0)", yeah and maybe if i can jump in so i think that um one of what i'm hearing is the access,17429.6,17436.0
"(17436.64, 17446.7)", for gathering um and and the need to access these resources um in some areas may be impacted by storage of pipes and other equipment.,17436.64,17446.7
"(17446.7, 17453.4)"," So maybe another recommended amendment could be that if pipes are planned to be reused,",17446.7,17453.4
"(17453.4, 17458.12)"," that they be stored in a manner that does not affect, you know, safe health and safety",17453.4,17458.12
"(17458.12, 17464.94)", on or along the trails or near the trails that are used for these practices.,17458.12,17464.94
"(17464.94, 17468.48)"," You know, be mindful of that impact here",17464.94,17468.48
"(17469.68, 17474.4)", and so chair we'd we'd for for mpl we'd be fine with that recommendation and frankly fine with,17469.68,17474.4
"(17474.4, 17479.2)", commissioner hannah's recommendation that we submit a plan to staff that incorporates those,17474.4,17479.2
"(17479.2, 17492.0)"," science those kinds of guarantees i've got i'm going to a commissioner Wayne. You had your hand up first, and then I'm gonna take Neil and then Michael Wayne.",17479.2,17492.0
"(17492.0, 17508.8)"," Oh, thank you, Chair. You know that was sort of my question for Kaleo is that in the staff submission, the landowner is listed as MPL so I think that was clear and Kaleo I guess my other question and help me with this is",17492.0,17508.8
"(17509.6, 17515.52)", what is the range of public access to this area,17509.6,17515.52
"(17518.48, 17528.64)", is it limited to the trail is it a sort of a free-ranging success if you could clarify that and then,17518.48,17528.64
"(17529.2, 17541.12)", my last question is uh how far beyond the stream does the commission have the right of governance,17529.2,17541.12
"(17542.8, 17547.44)", yeah so those are there's some legal questions in that context and aaron can,17542.8,17547.44
"(17547.44, 17554.24)", jump in too um you know and i'll speak based on what i understand and others can jump in,17547.44,17554.24
"(17554.8, 17562.4)", um but this road and access up into this area has been open or it could be considered like,17554.8,17562.4
"(17562.4, 17566.16)", a public highway in that context context even if it is privately owned,17562.4,17566.16
"(17567.04, 17574.96)", by an individual if there is access and undeveloped lands then our job under article 12,17567.04,17574.96
"(17574.96, 17580.0)", section 7 is to make sure that like as mentioned if somebody's gathering lay material in these,17574.96,17580.0
"(17580.0, 17586.56)", forests and and there's actions that we can take that are feasible um that we help to support and,17580.0,17586.56
"(17586.56, 17591.84)", ensure that that happens um so in that context that's why i'm recommending my recommendation,17586.56,17591.84
"(17591.84, 17597.52)", is tied to based on what was presented today in testimony um within our jurisdiction of kapal,17591.84,17597.52
"(17597.52, 17602.8)", kai and constitutional analysis and protection that we can make those kinds of recommendations,17597.52,17602.8
"(17603.36, 17606.44)", but you within the context of usually the commission's authority,17603.36,17606.44
"(17606.44, 17608.1)", jurisdiction is the stream diversion,17606.44,17608.1
"(17608.1, 17610.28)"," and the diversion works permit, right?",17608.1,17610.28
"(17610.28, 17613.72)"," And the actual materials used, how it's designed,",17610.28,17613.72
"(17613.72, 17615.34)"," how it's constructed, et cetera,",17613.72,17615.34
"(17615.34, 17618.76)"," that's usually within our authority of the water commission,",17615.34,17618.76
"(17618.76, 17621.72)", but we have an obligation to the public trust as a whole.,17618.76,17621.72
"(17621.72, 17624.6)"," So in that context, that recommendation",17621.72,17624.6
"(17624.6, 17625.04)"," and that potential amendment, I think, is in alignment with our public trust as a whole so in that context that that recommendation and that",17624.6,17625.04
"(17625.04, 17628.88)", potential amendment i think is in alignment with our public trust beliefs,17625.04,17628.88
"(17630.64, 17641.52)", well kaleo but the suggestion that we have the ability to govern the precise placement and use,17630.64,17641.52
"(17642.08, 17645.44)", or you know the treatment of these materials once removed,17642.08,17645.44
"(17646.48, 17652.56)", is that covered within our authority yeah i'm not governing that at all all i'm saying is what what,17646.48,17652.56
"(17652.56, 17658.96)", i my my proposed recommendation is really just to ensure that if a trail or there's access that's,17652.56,17658.96
"(17659.68, 17665.5)"," being blocked or health and safety is being impacted by how the materials are stored on the trail,",17659.68,17665.5
"(17665.5, 17671.56)"," then that is a result, a direct result of us removing the diversion right or the applicant",17665.5,17671.56
"(17671.56, 17676.44)", removing the diversion. There's a connection to that so I'm just laying out a recommendation,17671.56,17676.44
"(17676.44, 17689.4)", that kind of walks between both the testimony we receive and then our obligation under the code and the constitution. But I don't know if our AGs want to jump in,17676.44,17689.4
"(17689.66, 17691.8)", or provide any other guidance on that.,17689.66,17691.8
"(17691.8, 17694.88)", But I think that's my recommendation,17691.8,17694.88
"(17694.88, 17697.68)", that kind of meets the intent of what we're trying to do,17694.88,17697.68
"(17697.68, 17701.7)"," and accomplish as a commission is to remove diversions,",17697.68,17701.7
"(17703.36, 17708.46)"," as submitted and as applied for, but do that in a mindful",17703.36,17708.46
"(17708.46, 17709.46)", way.,17708.46,17709.46
"(17709.46, 17710.46)", Right.,17709.46,17710.46
"(17710.46, 17716.64)", So what does a landowner have any rights to quiet enjoyment of his property?,17710.46,17716.64
"(17716.64, 17718.64)", Not under Article 12.,17716.64,17718.64
"(17718.64, 17719.64)", Yeah.,17718.64,17719.64
"(17719.64, 17727.9)"," Again, this is the land is private property in this context, because the issues brought up and posed by",17719.64,17727.9
"(17727.9, 17732.7)", the testimony received are related to access.,17727.9,17732.7
"(17732.7, 17737.7)"," And as Native Hawaiians under Article 12, Section 7, that is something that's protected",17732.7,17737.7
"(17737.7, 17739.88)", on undeveloped lands.,17737.7,17739.88
"(17739.88, 17746.88)"," And because this trail is in existence, that's why i'm kind of recommending that proposed language",17739.88,17746.88
"(17747.6, 17752.72)", um it's not saying that you have to start on this specific place in your on your property and you,17747.6,17752.72
"(17752.72, 17758.72)", have to do this and you have to do that it's it's it's protecting that right and not necessarily,17752.72,17758.72
"(17758.72, 17766.56)", imposing um them on them what and how they should do things on their private property i'm focusing on,17758.72,17766.56
"(17766.56, 17772.64)", on the practice that we're trying to um manage that's it okay good thank you very much that's,17766.56,17772.64
"(17772.64, 17780.8)", helpful thank you commissioner i have neil and then michael and then aurora neil yes uh i'm,17772.64,17780.8
"(17780.8, 17786.5)", rather embarrassed to say that my garage is filled with different things that I think someday I'll reuse.,17780.8,17786.5
"(17787.58, 17791.68)"," And they just kind of sit there for long periods of time, cluttering the space.",17787.58,17791.68
"(17792.36, 17796.92)"," And so, likewise, I think, Harold, you might see pieces of pipe.",17792.36,17796.92
"(17797.2, 17798.86)"," Yeah, we use that someday.",17797.2,17798.86
"(17799.04, 17807.52)"," But do you have an actual permit or a plan to do so? If it's permitted, then if you get to open something,",17799.04,17807.52
"(17807.58, 17814.5)"," I can see that, okay, there's an impending reuse and you can efficiently move that piece of",17807.58,17814.5
"(17814.5, 17821.4)", equipment or inventory over to that site. But if it's just something that you might reuse at some,17814.5,17821.4
"(17821.4, 17825.52)"," point, then it could sit there a long long time i think the decision",17821.4,17825.52
"(17825.52, 17833.36)", to reactivate kamoko hasn't been made yet um but again it's just a matter of i think the,17825.52,17833.36
"(17835.2, 17840.72)", the request of the water commission to get all the pipes out of the stream is something to be met,17835.2,17840.72
"(17840.72, 17848.88)", with several mandates of effort versus you know having to take it much further could could,17840.72,17848.88
"(17848.88, 17852.28)", create more of a financial burden on the ranch and they're prepared to deal with it this time,17848.88,17852.28
"(17852.28, 17860.78)", i'd like to think um the play is um let us you know let them get that taken care of and if anyone's,17852.28,17860.78
"(17860.78, 17865.52)", got a concern at that point in time that it hasn't been uh stored suitably and,17860.78,17865.52
"(17865.52, 17873.12)", respect respectfully then you know we come back and revisit that but um uh it's just not wanting,17865.52,17873.12
"(17873.12, 17879.04)", to create any more burden on the ranch than is necessary but that benefit of to the ranch has,17873.12,17879.04
"(17879.04, 17885.0)", got to be looked over the life lifetime of the uh of of the improvement and the and the use of that material.,17879.04,17885.0
"(17887.82, 17890.28)"," I mean, in my land management experience,",17887.82,17890.28
"(17890.28, 17892.24)", had we got to the end of leases,17890.28,17892.24
"(17892.24, 17895.26)", and then looked at what at that moment,17892.24,17895.26
"(17895.26, 17899.86)"," was cost efficient for the landowner to remove or to handle,",17895.26,17899.86
"(17899.86, 17902.52)"," that would have been really, we would have inherited,",17899.86,17902.52
"(17902.52, 17906.8)"," and in some cases we did, lot of uh problems on our land",17902.52,17906.8
"(17907.76, 17912.48)", and so we permitted granted this was done in a day before there was a water commission but,17907.76,17912.48
"(17913.04, 17919.76)", it's currently our authority to permit these structures and in permitting them uh i think,17913.04,17919.76
"(17919.76, 17929.28)", we can condition uh what happens when they're removed when they're no longer allowed,17919.76,17929.28
"(17931.68, 17934.88)", i'm going to defer to legal counsel on that one,17931.68,17934.88
"(17937.28, 17939.52)", that was a that was a delicate punt harold,17937.28,17939.52
"(17947.8, 17948.14)"," um you know commissioner hannah's i, we work together a lot of time and I hope you know that I'm not trying to avoid anything.",17947.8,17948.14
"(17957.64, 17957.76)"," And just to be technically legal, perhaps you could have conditioned it when the permit was approved, but it's a different thing to condition it when we're following the commission's order to remove them.",17957.64,17957.76
"(17966.88, 17972.36)"," So with respect, I don't think that would be accurate, but I've tried to focus on the practical as much as the legal. And I think that there is, I have to defer to Harold on this one, potentially an opportunity to reuse the pipe",17966.88,17972.36
"(17972.36, 17978.64)"," at Komoku for the reactivation of that diversion, which is something that the commission has been",17972.36,17978.64
"(17978.64, 17992.0)"," interested in NPL pursuing as well. And so trying to balance those 2 points, I think, is is Harold articulated not burdening the order with with the condition requiring it to remove it completely from the property.",17978.64,17992.0
"(17992.0, 18006.6)"," I think is both appropriate for your jurisdiction and an appropriate, given the potential to reuse it in conformance with other directions that this Commission has given us. But as I said, I think that your initial suggestion to require us to submit",17992.0,18006.6
"(18006.6, 18011.16)"," a plan that staff approves, I would accept that. And I would also accept Commissioner",18006.6,18011.16
"(18011.16, 18018.56)"," of Kaleo, Deputy Director Emanuel's recommendation that any stacking of the pipe not impact the",18011.16,18018.56
"(18018.56, 18023.44)", Pa'akai. And I won't debate whether that's within the Commission's authority or not.,18018.56,18023.44
"(18023.44, 18027.36)", I don't think we need to. I think that that's a practical thing and a fair thing,18023.44,18027.36
"(18027.36, 18028.76)", for us to commit to doing.,18027.36,18028.76

"(18042.56, 18045.4)", It's really hard to micromanage things on site,18042.56,18045.4
"(18045.4, 18047.4)", for Pono Lulu.,18045.4,18047.4
"(18047.4, 18052.4)", I support Commissioner Hanna's recommendation.,18047.4,18052.4

"(18070.48, 18079.04)", thing so i i would move to approve item b2 with the amendment that commissioner uh anna's recommend,18070.48,18079.04

"(18093.6, 18100.08)", if i may indulge um i guess a story and a question maybe the first question is is this,18093.6,18100.08

"(18227.0, 18242.0)"," And you know I've known couch have chased for a long time, as he's appeared before the land use commission. And he always seemed to find a way to be practical and represent his client well, but also look for a solution.",18227.0,18242.0
"(18242.0, 18246.36)"," I mean I think under Kapa'a Kai, we as the Water Commission",18242.0,18246.36
"(18246.36, 18254.48)"," have to balance the interests. So, but I too am optimistic that, you know, we've heard",18246.36,18254.48
"(18254.48, 18262.4)", from the community. I think they have provided us ample information that there is traditional,18254.48,18262.4
"(18262.4, 18266.48)", customary practices being exercised in this area there are people,18262.4,18266.48
"(18266.48, 18272.64)", who have linear connections to the place i've heard of at least a couple of them who've talked,18266.48,18272.64
"(18272.64, 18288.52)", about generational connections to the place in my mind those are very um those are very much in line with the kind of information that we should be considering,18272.64,18288.52
"(18288.52, 18292.78)", in adopting appropriate mitigation measures.,18288.52,18292.78
"(18292.78, 18296.1)", That I believe is well within our purview.,18292.78,18296.1

"(18301.1, 18306.32)", this case is the abandonment and the removal. I see it as appropriate mitigation.,18301.1,18306.32
"(18307.06, 18317.16)"," The removal of this opala or these pipes, that seems to be very appropriate mitigation for purposes of Kapa'akai.",18307.06,18317.16

"(18328.1, 18335.9)", prepare a plan that's approved by the staff which is probably less onerous than I think where the,18328.1,18335.9
"(18335.9, 18343.64)", commission is heading so you should take that as a as a as a gift because I think staff is going to,18335.9,18343.64
"(18343.64, 18346.24)", be more reasonable but I would like to see a deadline,18343.64,18346.24
"(18346.8, 18352.32)", i don't want to see this coming back a year later and the community saying they haven't removed,18346.8,18352.32
"(18352.32, 18359.2)", things so i mean i think you know it is appropriate to put some kind of a reasonable deadline and,18352.32,18359.2
"(18359.2, 18367.74)", this i would ask harold and cal when do you think you can get the things out I mean obviously the good weather,18359.2,18367.74
"(18367.74, 18372.96)", days what we'd be looking for to get that work done so I mean I would think the time limit of,18367.74,18372.96
"(18372.96, 18379.74)", like six months or less would be reasonable and um you know if that doesn't stretch anybody out,18372.96,18379.74
"(18379.74, 18386.72)", I think that makes sense and I think you know obviously there's lots of eyes on this um there will be all,18379.74,18386.72
"(18386.72, 18392.12)", the way through it being completed so as I think Commissioner Buck mentioned if we don't do a good,18386.72,18392.12
"(18392.12, 18397.1)", job um we'll be back in front of you and that's not the way we'll be back in front of you so,18392.12,18397.1
"(18397.7, 18406.96)", I think we can move forward with Mr Hannis's uh recommendation and everybody will end up happy in the end that makes sense and you know what hell,18397.7,18406.96
"(18406.96, 18412.56)", i suspect that many of the people that testify today they might even be willing to help you,18406.96,18412.56
"(18413.36, 18419.84)", that's a good chance i would say this is the beginning of a you know cooperative relationship,18413.36,18419.84
"(18419.84, 18427.8)"," i mean i have a hunch they would probably expedite this even quicker than six months, but I think six months seems to be reasonable, you are the landowner.",18419.84,18427.8

"(18791.36, 18795.8)"," Again, I just I just wanted to raise something that came to mind",18791.36,18795.8
"(18796.6, 18800.28)", when when Commissioner Kagao Viviani was discussing,18796.6,18800.28

"(18812.92, 18819.38)"," And it's sort of like, you know, HEPA chapter 343 requires an environmental assessment when there may be significant impacts caused by an action and is triggered in part by",18812.92,18819.38
"(18819.38, 18828.32)", presence of these actions on conservation lands and so although if the pipes were cut up um,18819.38,18828.32
"(18828.32, 18833.28)", carried closer to their final destination out of the cavella watershed and placed somewhere,18828.32,18833.28
"(18833.28, 18840.08)", outside of that area um i think that uh it'd be safe to assume that it would be exempt from,18833.28,18840.08
"(18840.08, 18845.98)"," chapter 343 if the refuse is simply left in the conservation lands, I think that does raise a question",18840.08,18845.98
"(18845.98, 18850.44)", of whether that might cause environmental impacts.,18845.98,18850.44
"(18850.44, 18853.36)"," And so at that point, I don't actually believe",18850.44,18853.36

"(18887.04, 18890.3)"," Oh, no, so anyway, Chair, I was just gonna say that,",18887.04,18890.3
"(18890.3, 18891.92)"," you know, the action that's being approved",18890.3,18891.92

"(18902.88, 18905.16)", as the Commission's authority goes tell us to,18902.88,18905.16
"(18905.16, 18911.1)", leave it and so the exemption declaration is entirely correct I I would if we were considering,18905.16,18911.1
"(18911.1, 18917.1)", you know the other action where it has to go and whether it can be stacked for a time in the,18911.1,18917.1
"(18917.1, 18922.0)", consultation area while we decide whether to reuse it I would say that would also fall under existing,18917.1,18922.0
"(18922.0, 18925.36)", exemption just not the ones before you because that's not,18922.0,18925.36
"(18925.36, 18929.84)", the action that you're being asked to consider or whether where your jurisdiction lies that would go,18925.36,18929.84
"(18929.84, 18935.76)", to OCCL if it were necessary I think it is accurate to say that because these materials have been,18929.84,18935.76
"(18935.76, 18940.24)", there for so long they are grandfathered but all of those are legal discussions and debates that,18935.76,18940.24
"(18940.24, 18947.0)"," this commission doesn't need to have the action that's proposed was appropriately declared to be exempt by staff,",18940.24,18947.0
"(18947.0, 18953.0)"," at least recommended to be declared as exempt by staff. And, you know, Mahesh, with deep respect for his abilities as advocate,",18947.0,18953.0
"(18953.0, 18959.0)"," he doesn't oppose that portion of the exemption, meaning the actual thing that you're considering.",18953.0,18959.0
"(18959.0, 18972.86)", And so I don't think that that comment changes the analysis here or changes our support for using the same recommendation that same decision that was followed on item B2 for B3.,18959.0,18972.86
"(18973.0, 18989.76)"," I believe it's appropriate here as well. that he's going to put the abandoned material on conservation land, then aren't we on notice",18973.0,18989.76
"(18989.78, 18992.56)", that we now have to look into,18989.78,18992.56
