This is what we tried last time, and I think the public hearing occurred after all of the committee meetings. We were lucky that it went through, but anyway, that's what we're trying to do. If the staff feels that it's appropriate to notice the public hearing so that we can time the actual public hearing in alignment with the city council adoption, I think it took six months for the commission because of the 90-day notice the last time.

So, anyway, that's the approval process, and I think that's the last slide there, Abbey. We're available for questions if there are any.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** Sorry, question again.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Go ahead.
