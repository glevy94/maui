straightforward. You scrape up the dirty soil, you move it offsite and put it anyways. But how does aquifer remediation proceed, or are you waiting for the groundwater monitoring modeling studies? You know, like --

COMMISSIONER HO: Yeah, I think -- I mean, I think it's a combination. We have to do the modeling to see where it's moving, but also, like Sarah had said, it really is -- we really do need to, in earnest, wait until it's defueled because we want to make sure that there are studies that are being done, but if there is a drop that enters the environment in any way as a result of the defueling effort, weâ€™re gonna have to analyze that as well.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Right.

CAPTAIN SULLIVAN: And we're very sensitive to any penetrations, any pathways that we could create --

MS. MOODY: And one of our primary efforts during defueling is groundwater protection efforts, so increased monitoring of the aquifer, of the soil vapor to be able to
