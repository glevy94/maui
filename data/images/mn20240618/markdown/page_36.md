C. NON-ACTION ITEM / INFORMATIONAL BRIEFING  

2. Update on Implementation of Waimea Watershed Agreement, Waimea, Kaua‘i,  
Regarding Kōke‘e Ditch Diversion Modifications and Cost Estimates by Kaua‘i Island Utility Cooperative and Kekaha Agriculture Association to be Performed Under a Pending Stream Diversion Works Permit by Commission Staff  

**PRESENTATION GIVEN BY:** Deputy Dean Uyeno  

Staff shared progress on the Waimea Watershed Agreement between the relevant parties.  

**QUESTIONS / COMMENTS**  

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** The first step in that, I think we identified three steps to this that number one, let's agree on the scope. Before we go out in cost, it seemed like there were a little different ideas on what the scope of the project would be. Have we got that nailed down?  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** No, not at this point. I think part of it was getting the cost and figure out…  

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Don't you want to do the scope before the cost?  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** I think to be able to pick and choose, I can’t recall the discussion that we had but in order to…  

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** The scope of what's required to fulfill the obligations of the mediation agreement, then secondly the cost of that, then third since we were considering an in lieu payment by KIUC, then a determination of how you best use the monies that you have from KIUC and any other sources. I thought the first thing was the scope of work required to fulfill the terms of the agreement that they all have together.  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** Sorry, I can't recall that discussion. Maybe if any of the parties want to jump in.  

**CHAIR CHANG:** My understanding was, you're right, it was identifying the scope, but it sounded almost like KIUC might have been willing to do more or I think they wanted to see the Cadillac version versus the minimum. Maybe if the Cadillac version was something that they could afford then they wanted to know the cost of that to determine what would be the section. I may be wrong.
