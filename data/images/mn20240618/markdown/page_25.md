maintained. So that we have other instream values not just ‘ōpu and ‘ōpae, but the recreational needs are met. The downstream uses are maintained, the nearshore impacts are preserved, so that I think we can find a balance where the stream is protected and the DHHL needs are met.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** Wait a second though, you cannot meet all of DHHL needs if you have those minimal requirements for continued stream flow, so something has to give. DHHL cannot get everything that they want in a particular…except at the cost of other off-stream users.

**DR. STRAUCH:** On a case by case basis with sufficient storage, I mean DHHL is not going to start a sugar plantation. I think there is some way forward that meets all needs in some…

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** I absolutely disagree with that, you can't have everything for everybody.

**DR. STRAUCH:** Not everybody, just…

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** I understand that, what I'm saying is that we're not dealing with really huge rivers in Hawai‘i, we're dealing with fairly small streams. Say you're having an off-stream use, even those in non-management areas that have riparian or appurtenant rights, appurtenant rights is a little different because they're also sort of a public trust purpose. You’re going to have to come to a time where you cannot say that one public trust purpose has absolute priority or the other. I don't think that you can get to a case, my preference, I don't know if it’s a legal preference, would we still have to maintain minimal viable stream flows at the cost of DHHL getting all the water that they want, but we're going to get a case like that eventually.

**DR. STRAUCH:** It will come to things like climate change and the severity of say drought conditions and the length of those drought conditions. Everything's going to be affected.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** Even without those changes, as DHHL is able to provide their beneficiaries homesteads and increase water, you'll get to a point where the amount of water available is not going to be enough even in aquifers.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** Asking another way if I might, you said that CWRM has never approved reservations for other than DHHL and that may be the case. Can we make reservations for other public trust uses?

**KATIE ROTH:** My understanding is yes.
