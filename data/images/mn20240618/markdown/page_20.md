Minutes  

amount of discretion that the Chairperson has or the First Deputy has. I wasn't comfortable with that either. Ryan, did you want to make a comment?  

**RYAN IMATA:** Just a comment that if rulemaking affects this decision or maybe there's a question- should rulemaking affect the decision that was made in December of last year, too? Because I think it's the same thing and I think that maybe if rulemaking was an issue, that should have been an issue in December, too. I just wanted to bring that up.  

**CHAIR CHANG:** No, but the December decision was not to delegate, it was to bring everything back to the Commission, right?  

**RYAN IMATA:** But there were exceptions and I think that's where rulemaking is looking at the exceptions, right? I think December also had exceptions to it.  

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** I have one last question. It's not about this, it's about - where's DHHL? We've been talking with Jonathan Scheuer just about every time we have a meeting. Is he not representing your agency?  

**ANDREW CHOY:** Jonathan does represent our agency, he is human and needs a vacation so that's why staff is here.  

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** That's why you're here now, but you were basically complaining that we had not consulted with DHHL and all along we've been talking to Jonathan. As a matter of fact, Jonathan has been very assertive about appearing before the Commission. So what is your position about when DHHL gets consulted?  

**ANDREW CHOY:** I think if you look at the submittal, you can see very clearly that the Boards of Water Supply, Departments of Water Supply were clearly consulted well before this action was taken and it's documented in the submittal. We were just notified about it over the weekend over a phone call.  

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** That's not my question. My question is that we have to formally ask every time and whenever Jonathan shows up that he's showing up as an individual person and not with DHHL? The reason I ask is that I thought we've been talking with DHHL just about at every meeting.  

**ANDREW CHOY:** When Jonathan appears before the Commission, he will either announce that he's talking on behalf of the Department or not.  

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** Yeah, as a matter of fact he has done that. Okay, so what you're wanting is more inclusion in the formal process? Okay, all right, thank you.  

**CHAIR CHANG:** As I understand, it's this particular item, itâ€™s this agenda.
