Informational Briefing to the Commission on Statewide Drought Conditions
Neal Fujii (CWRM State Drought & Water Conservation Coordinator), Dr. Ayron Strauch (CWRM Hydrologist), Ryan Imata (Hydrologic Program Manager)
Staff shared the general drought outlook for the state and provided an overview of the Hawaiʻi Drought Council meeting held on November 17, 2023. Current surface water and groundwater conditions were also discussed.
I'll just briefly add. The Drought Council hasn't met I think what was it, 2017 was the last. Then we came onboard and after Neal suggested we should really reconvene this group because it appears based upon National Weather Service, Kevin Kodama predictions, we're going to go into a much drier season. This was even before the Lahaina fire and then the Lahaina fire came and it's become even more apparent, the predictions are I would say dire. It looks like we're going from a dry summer, fall, winter, spring and then going back into a dry summer. I think what was particularly alarming, at least for me, was hearing from Maui County, Upcountry Kula when we maybe about two months ago we were talking to John Stufflebean. They had 30 days of water left because they are dependent on surface water. Two of the three wells were dry because the water was just not flowing into the streams, the one well or the one facility Kamole. The governor's office asked CWRM and DLNR, is there anything we can do as a State agency and what we realize is they are really challenged because they're at capacity. It's not as if we could amend IIFS or amend the water permit. EMI, they're giving the county the water that the county can put into their Kamole facility. This is really real and Hawaiʻi island is taking a proactive approach. They're talking about a water conservation campaign, Keith is looking at doing more education but he sees it as well especially in the Kona District area. We did as a Drought Council suggest that perhaps the Governor and the mayors can get together with a collective message about water conservation because we know that with the drought is the inevitable cycle, dry, we’re going to be more vulnerable to fires, invasive species come, and it's not going to get any better. I think we're looking at how do we change people's behavior to become much more aware of water is a limited resource. We've seen that in Red Hill, we're seeing that in Lahaina. We'll see what comes out of this but, I've come to realize several of the bills that were vetoed including House Bill 1088 would have positioned CWRM, the Water Commission in particular, to be in a position to declare an emergency and take appropriate actions. We are also discussing that with legislators as well as with the governor's office. I think the Drought Council recognized the fact that we represent different constituencies in the State of Hawaiʻi, that there's a common thread that weaves us together which is the public health and safety of the community and the protection of our water resources.
If I can Chair, the only thing I’d add is based on predictions, the peak dry period is January/February. We're not even at the peak dry period or you wouldn't say peak but the lowest rainfall that we expected is in January and February. Now is really a time to start to be proactive in message in preparation for even more restrictions on water use or more limits on systems capacities and then also our role as a regulator of water resources. Right now you heard Maui and Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply looking at conservation efforts, but part of our challenge is also to make sure that private water systems are also carrying their weight through this drought season and are working towards conservation efforts. I think our strategy here is to get everyone on board whether on a private system or a public system. We have to get through this together in the next couple of months or hopefully couple months but it's kind of looking like it might be closer to a year. We might not get a wet season basically is what we're seeing so that's the only thing I'd wanted to add based on the conversations today.
I think that is important and that in my mind House Bill 1088 would have permitted us to bring in private purveyors.
I don't want to see like what happened recently with Lahaina fire where there were moves to suspend the IFS when the proper way to go about it in a water management area which has permits is to prioritize the permits first before you start thinking about changing the whole interim instream flow standards. Even in places without water management designation there are priorities under the common law in terms of appurtenant and riparian rights which still have primacy and people can still take away water as long as those rights are not being affected. I think to the extent we can, we should try to predict or be proactive about who gets water first and who starts getting cut first and how you would distribute cuts if you have to rather than waiting for something to happen and then precipitately try to do something. I know it's going to be tough but the law is pretty clear about both the code and under the common law about the prioritizing of water use.
It's good to see the coordination of these agencies and private players on the demand side. I can think of not just sitting and talking, looking at the information together but having collaborative strategies. Farmers in particular and ranchers choosing where they graze, how they graze, what animals they're using or what the crops are growing that are really predicated upon not what the rain they hope for but the rain they're going to get. The risks and using them to manage risk, I think is really important. Equally and I don't see it so much there on the supply side, if we believe our own ʻōlelo noʻeau “hāhai nō ka ua i ka ululāʻau,” the rain follows the forest. This should give impetus to our watershed partnerships and what they're doing, not only at the highest elevation levels of reforestation and dealing with the threats to the native forest but even down gradient. Really moving to every step of the way have agroforestry and understory that'll really optimize capture, minimize runoff and so forth. That combined strategy and having the public see the whole thing, not just their one little strand that they're passionate about or interested in. It's a holistic approach that needs to be understood by everyone in a holistic way. If the council could move in this direction, I think they could really promote a large public interest.
We do have in DOFAW our watershed partnership. Definitely there's a connection there, we can bring them in.
That's become a priority in this budget session, it's all fire suppression. We've really been pushing watershed management and protecting the watershed to ensure we have fresh water. Sometimes it takes a crisis for people to appreciate and our need to be more proactive.
I just want to say something because this is actually the field I work in, but for natural resource managers, too they're not going to be planting in a drought because the climate effects are getting stronger, but the emphasis on fencing because what's happening now is the goats are nailing whatever is left. If you want to keep the sediment you've got to manage the overrun. I was just in Kona. I do have a question related before you leave the seat on what's the status of our water shortage plans, in particular Pearl Harbor water shortage plan? Because we kind of left that off somewhere last year. I think we're going to need to call it back, including Honolulu water shortage plan.
The Pearl Harbor Water Shortage Plan is as we left it, was approved. That is we haven't changed it. We've talked about going back and revisiting that in light of the Red Hill crisis. Honolulu Water Shortage Plan, that has not been done. We are thinking about doing that just because that's the other area on Oʻahu that has a lot of withdrawals and we do see some stress on some of the groundwater aquifers in that area, too. That's definitely something that we want to...hasn't been done. We do plan to coordinate with Honolulu Board of Water Supply who's come out with their own water shortage and recovery plan, part of it was in response to the Red Hill crisis as well. That's the status.
I appreciate your point. Another example, dealing with axis deer. On Maui you're talking about the crisis of Kula, 30 days or whatever. How much of that is really exacerbated by the rampant population which is way over. It should be zero but even at a sustainable level, it's at the tens of thousands. We got to bring it down and that's where policies of both the Department of Agriculture...Whatever we can do on the ag side to foster more use of that asset because it is an asset and accelerate the decline of that population helps with the water.
It's really sad on Molokaʻi in particular. We actually have a really good partnership with the U.S. DOD REPI (Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration) program and they have been extremely helpful in providing us resources for fencing. On Maui as well, DOFAW is actively and aggressively putting up fences as quickly as they can get resources to do that, so your point is well taken.
That's the value of this council. When you have the many stakeholders is not just to get the information but to really plan and collaborate coordinated strategy together.
Since we talked about fencing and grazing, one of the tricky things and I don't think it comes up enough is that sometimes ungulates are your friends for fuel load. I know it's not within our wheelhouse as the Commission, but we have an interest in seeing the land managed a certain way. If there are ways that we can support or complement what's happening in DLNR and others, if that can come before us and we can be aware to support it even though it's not our decision.
To get an informational briefing from them. DOFAW is actively managing the watershed with watershed partnerships but all of the different strategies...Michael Walker, they are the fire protection force. They are the lead in forest fires and they have been actively, in fact he was just on 60 Minutes. Let's see if we can work that into our agenda at some point in time but doing a presentation by DOFAW on what they're doing both on ungulates, on invasive species, invasive plants as well as the different strategies that they're using.
Our forested watersheds can go poof really fast like in Mililani.
Mililani is a good example.
We had that discussion now because those slides still don't cover the supply side, the things we can do to foster more water being there. It's all demand side stuff. The encouragement is to just think holistically about this.
Remember the TNC publication about 25 years ago The Last Stand, The Vanishing Hawaiian Forest? It gave impetus to the rain follows the forest, the DLNR program. The back end of that included an economic analysis and I'm wondering if the time is now right to forge partnerships with our colleagues or other colleagues through Aurora at University of Hawaiʻi to do economic analysis of investment in infrastructure upgrades. That reservoir you pointed to, other intakes and so forth because we know why we want it. Farmers can't necessarily do it or land owners can't necessarily do it so how do we get that unstuck? I think somebody's got to do the analysis to show the return from the investment and also perhaps the need to get that return. Maybe there needs to be an infusion of grant money from either government or philanthropic sources as well as investment capital from that, but we can't just hope they see this. If we want to control our destiny at all we've got to help produce the evidence that'll help them see it. In the case of watershed conservation and so forth, we did that. It says, “you save this water here, this is the return you're going to get from its use” and so forth. It served a purpose in getting the investment in the watershed partnerships. Now we need to do it for water distribution and storage infrastructure.
Two years ago, we did get a legislature appropriated $10 million for dams and reservoirs. It was a grant program. Unfortunately, they didn't provide us any capacity so we're going back to the legislature to ask. It actually creates a fund for private land owners to now apply for grants to restore their reservoirs or their dams because in light of what happened at Kaloko, liability concern is a mounting issue. Our engineering department, applying those standards, have decided what's high risk and you have either a choice to upgrade or remove.
I made those decisions and spent those dollars and they're considerable, but it turns on some kind of economic analysis and we can give the environmental data and so forth but I think we need to couple it with an economic analysis.
You're exactly right. For utility companies, public or private utility companies, they're limited in terms of their source of revenues, to revenue they get from their customers. They can't raise money for projects like this on a practical basis. That's exactly right.
Got some scholars over there who can help us?
Not infrastructure. I'm thinking of who they are and I’ll see one who's guest lecturing in my class on Wednesday. I'll put that bug in their ear. I'll just say Kim Barnett has done work on this and Chris Wada out of Uyehiro and so it's time to revisit. Before it was Jim Rimiset but he's long retired. I have a question, thinking about the effort. So much has changed in the last couple months about what we think of as risk and where the investments need to be made. As we look at the El Nino development, we have our statistics for flows but we're already seeing that maybe we need to be more conservative in planning forward. Having been with you on the EMI looking at all the diversions, it was like a year or so ago, it occurs to me as flows drop and we do have some spots in the streams that are fed by groundwater, imagining future drying. We're going to have little pockets of ʻoʻopu graveyards in some places. So, how do we think about our IIFSs, if we are still updating them in these areas, to think about the populations of biota as a whole, regionally, versus stream by stream. I don't know if you've given thought to that, but how can we be of support thinking we're facing some rough couple of years, but I don't know the life cycle of different species of ʻoʻopu. Maybe a couple years can really take them out or maybe they can bounce back and they have refugia, but how do we need to be thinking about our long-term duty to supply people with water, to maintain our ecosystems, and then with the knowledge that you have about stream flows and El Nino projections, how do we put it together in an intelligent, more holistic way?
We definitely consider ʻoʻopu source and sync populations if you know population dynamics. There are definitely streams that are sync population so we might supply an instream flow standard for the ecosystem but it's not a robust, abundant, reproducing population of ʻoʻopu as opposed to a different stream that might have different characteristics like an estuary or higher vegetation along the riparian zone or that sort of different structural characteristics that make it a more conducive location for a nōpili to be happy and reproduce, that sort of thing. There are a lot of questions still out there on what is actually happening in the environment. We have an instream flow standard at Honomanū, for example. Honomanū is a losing reach and despite it being a really important environment for ʻoʻopu and for cultural practices, it dries up naturally for months at a time now. I'm not making a recommendation one way or the other at this point but that environment, still what you want to protect for an ecosystem. Those are questions that we can ask. I think it's definitely worth identifying streams that have potential, whether it's refugia or source populations so that we can sustain on a landscape scale our native species and identify those high-quality streams and definitely focus your protection on those priorities. I don't know if that answers your question.
I think that's exactly the right answer and the answer that's headed in the right direction and that is to go through a categorization if you will of the streams and really ranking their productivity in terms of the environmental worth saving and should be cherished locations. Others perhaps need to be put more under harness under these drought conditions and extreme conditions we've got today.
It's exactly how we approached East Maui, the EMI decision and order.
It's a rationalization, but it's practical when it's going to be necessary.
The East Maui contested case began that process of identifying streams but first time that they are actually coming up with good habitat information. You can't really try to restore all the streams, you got to pick the ones that are best. The people that live along the stream that you don't pick are not going to be very happy.
It's a painful, difficult process.
Just to add, you'll see a lag. The reported date is August so we're usually a quarter behind with for example the Board’s data that we get so we haven't seen the drought numbers reflected in these graphs that Ryan is sharing.
Ryan, what’s the status of the Hālawa Shaft?
That's a good question. For the Board of Water Supply, the last that heard from them I don't think they're going to bring that online for quite a while. They are looking at a lot of different alternative sources to supplement or to feed the system there. I think there's an ʻAiea 497 that they applied for. They're looking at various other sites but I think they have an application in for Waipiʻo Heights 3 and 4. That's kind of far though, that's in Waiawa so whether that's going to make up the water or those far farther out remote wells are going to make up the water for Hālawa or whether they're going to apply for wells closer to ʻAiea kind of remains to be seen right now. It's hard for me to comment on that. It's probably better addressed by the Board of Water Supply, but yes as far as Hālawa, I don't think that's going to be brought back online anytime soon.
Do you know what the reason for that is?
Again, I can't speak for the Board, but I don’t think that they want to pump it at the quantity that they pumped it at previously because of the potential for migrating any kind of contamination over to Hālawa Shaft.
Basically it's everything you all said. We cannot do business as usual especially watching the reports and seeing that it's all down. Some of them are past the warning and are actually approaching the critical and the fact that, what you all mentioned earlier as well with having the information between CWRM, BLNR as well as all these other entities that especially are focused on just continually developing whether it's master plans, these types of things really have to be taken into consideration. I do have a question for Ryan and then after that I do have one thing to add on to the Kauaʻi one. I was trying to look for the information but one question, Ryan. I noticed that the ‘Ewa Beach, Honouliuli, the millions of gallons per day is like 162 and then over the third 300. That reading I just want to know how, as we notice unnecessary watering of golf courses like for the Navy, that type of issue. How do also unnecessary uses like water parks especially with the flushing the system as well as the car system, the capstone, how does it specifically affect ‘Ewa Beach given these numbers that we’re given and the geology of the area? Then lastly is the Kauaʻi one. I can't find the exact number but I did see from last year May in Kauaʻi my testimony recorded and a side note is if this Commission as well as you know any commission like water commission on the other islands, do you all reread minutes of past meetings? Because you can learn a lot. I'm looking here that in addition to a lot of leaks, I think it was like 3 million total leakage reported for the whole year of last year in Kauaʻi and in addition they have billing issues and if you don't revisit them it'll be easily forgotten and you'll just be on a loophole dealing with the same thing month after month, year after year. So, to reread previous meeting minutes because there's issue of morale and for the employees, the billers but it seems that the engineers are the ones really on top of asking the right questions. Regarding over development, billing, leakages, and everything I think that would be good for this Commission as well as all water commissions on the specific islands. Those three points and then in light of the drought as well. Mahalo.
Tara, I know you had a question for me. I think it's probably best and if the Commission agrees maybe it's best that you contact me directly. I wasn't quite clear on what your question was, but maybe if the Commission's okay with it, maybe it's best I put my email address in the chat. Maybe it's best if Tara directs her questions toward me?
Mr. Anthony Loccitio presented testimony on a matter that did not pertain to Item B-3. Chair Chang requested that they speak on this after the conclusion of the meeting.
