General Informational Briefing on Water Reservations for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands by Commission Staff
PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Katie Roth, Planning Branch Chief; Dr. Ayron Strauch, Acting Stream Protection and Management Branch Chief
Staff presented the process of reserving water, existing and pending Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) water reservations, and future DHHL water demands.
Can I interrupt you for a second? That last point- may have to adjust the IIFS (interim instream flow standard)- stream water is a resource and that's a public trust purpose, so are you saying from your standpoint that DHHL has superior rights than the stream itself?
Maybe I'll defer that to Ayron if he wants to comment a little bit more about his process when establishing.
You can answer that later, I just wanted to interrupt you. KATIE ROTH: Okay, do you want to answer it now or later?
When we get into the discussion.
Aloha Commissioners, Ayron Strauch of the Stream Protection and Management Branch. The modification of an IIFS in the balancing of non-instream uses might be needed to accommodate a reservation or use for DHHL as a public trust use. One example would be the 2018 decision and order in Nā Wai ʻEhā that sets an IIFS on North Waiʻehu as natural flow. At the time, DHHL was not a party to the Nā Wai ʻEhā contested case and their potential non-instream usage was not considered in the decision, but they have lands in Waiʻehu that could potentially utilize non-potable water. So, we might need to modify the North Waiʻehu IIFS to accommodate those uses.
But I'm talking about cases where usually when we set an IIFS, it's been my experience that we basically set it at the minimum that allows viable stream life, not way above it. In a case where the IIFS is at a level that any lowering of it all would harm the stream, are you saying that from your standpoint we have to do that?
I'm not making a blanket statement across all IIFS and in actuality I don't think most IIFS have been minimum, they've been above the minimum.
So what would happen then if you have a DHHL reservation request which is reasonable, but it takes off more from the stream than what would be the minimal viability?
That would be a balancing that the Commission would need to make. The stream is not more important as compared to DHHL, it's equally important as DHHL.
Okay, so what is the compromise? The reason I ask is that there have been some dicta by the Supreme Court that said there may be instances where you have to destroy the resource to accommodate uses, never went beyond that to say how do you decide that. Okay, but in this case there will come a time because DHHL is finally getting enough lands to be used, especially in rural areas where they don't have access to a public water supply system, they have to put in their own. There's going to be a time that we have to decide, but from my standpoint, if you take a stream below viability, that's destroying the stream. It seems to me from my standpoint you can only draw enough water for off-stream uses, including DHHL where it does not affect the stream viability. Now the obvious answer is that other users get their water taken away for DHHL because DHHL is a public trust purpose. I think that also when in the current Water Management Areas, if you have unused or unpermitted excess in a particular aquifer or in a stream area and DHHL gets a reservation, that amount of water gets taken off about what is available for other permits, right? That’s what happens?
If you may allow me to comment, the history behind stream diversions and IIFS has been that the construction of the dam essentially took all but the high flows. I would assume, and we would probably make the recommendation that, to meet, say a DHHL need or any other need, we should not be so destructive to the stream as to completely drain it or completely remove all but the high flows, such that even if we lowered an IIFS to say the 64% of medium base flow, which has kind of been accepted as that minimum that you're talking about, there is still opportunity to provide for the flushing of larvae or nutrients or sediment or coarse woody debris to provide for the habitat, to keep the riffles and runs flowing, so that we have migratory pathways maintained. So that we have other instream values not just ʻoʻopu and ʻōpae, but the recreational needs are met. The downstream uses are maintained, the nearshore impacts are preserved, so that I think we can find a balance where the stream is protected and the DHHL needs are met.
Wait a second though, you cannot meet all of DHHL needs if you have those minimal requirements for continued stream flow, so something has to give. DHHL cannot get everything that they want in a particular...except at the cost of other off-stream users.
On a case by case basis with sufficient storage, I mean DHHL is not going to start a sugar plantation. I think there is some way forward that meets all needs in some...
I absolutely disagree with that, you can't have everything for everybody.
Not everybody, just...
I understand that, what I'm saying is that we're not dealing with really huge rivers in Hawaiʻi, we're dealing with fairly small streams. Say you're having an off-stream use, even those in non-management areas that have riparian or appurtenant rights, appurtenant rights is a little different because they're also sort of a public trust purpose. You’re going to have to come to a time where you cannot say that one public trust purpose has absolute priority or the other. I don't think that you can get to a case, my preference, I don't know if it’s a legal preference, would we still have to maintain minimal viable stream flows at the cost of DHHL getting all the water that they want, but we're going to get a case like that eventually.
It will come to things like climate change and the severity of say drought conditions and the length of those drought conditions. Everything's going to be affected.
Even without those changes, as DHHL is able to provide their beneficiaries homesteads and increase water, you'll get to a point where the amount of water available is not going to be enough even in aquifers.
Asking another way if I might, you said that CWRM has never approved reservations for other than DHHL and that may be the case. Can we make reservations for other public trust uses?
My understanding is yes.         
Okay, it just hasn't been done yet.
Can I interrupt on there because let me see if Barry is still around. I think long time ago I told Barry, why don't you guys ask for reservations for the public water systems so that you don't have to be competing with private people all the time? So it is a possibility.
Exactly, that's correct for household use, for the rest of the public if you will. That's exactly right.
Back to your earlier point, Larry, in my years on the Commission, we never tried to give every everything they wanted. We tried to balance as best we could and would you agree that the East Maui contested case discussion might be relevant here where every stream was different. Some streams were highly compromised and so forth and those we put a minimal wetted pathway, other streams were really heavy kalo users and so forth. We treated those, made sure they had enough for their public trust uses and then we withdrew what we could to get to DHHL lands and so forth, but it was very much a balancing act. We don't, especially now with DHHL’s additional infusion, much needed infusion of cash that'll allow more development, I'm really keen to hear how that's going to change their reservation needs in the future because we got to rejigger, we got to rebalance again. Now this is just stream, now ground is a whole different issue and much of their needs will be supplied by groundwater, I assume, but when it comes to streams it really is a challenging balancing.
Paul, if you have a comment on that, go ahead.
This was a follow-up question, we asked whether we can make reservations. Do you think we have a duty to make reservations for other people for future needs or public trust users?
I don't know if I would comment on without and that's maybe a legal...
You said we have a duty to DHHL.
My question relates to this.
Do we have a duty to take into account the needs of other public trust users? That's the question, maybe that's a question for the AG.
I think my question relates to this and I'll just say it's a bit of a red herring to frame other [inaudible], but DHHL has a particular status, correct? Katie can you run down the history of that ruling? My understanding is DHHL has this level of priority because of conditions of Statehood and this is somewhat analogous to the Winters Doctrine in the US where Navajo have rights of prior appropriation. Do you have that background Katie?
Maybe I would defer to Andrew and DHHL staff to come up and comment on that.
Aloha Andrew Choy, representing the Department of Hawaiian Homelands, thank you for the question Commissioner Kagawa. The Department has a unique history. As you folks know it was established by Congress in 1921, adopted by the full Congress back then. It was administered by the Territory of Hawaiʻi up until Statehood. Now when Hawaiʻi was admitted to the US through the Admissions Act, one of the conditions of the Admissions Act was that the State would take on the responsibility of carrying out the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act as a condition of Statehood. That is one statutory authority. The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act was thus incorporated into State of Hawaiʻi’s Constitution. Its water rights are articulated as part of the State's Constitution, it's also identified specifically in the Water Code as and also further validated by Supreme Court rulings as a public trust purpose use of water. I don't know if that answered your question, Commissioner?
I think it does because I think without understanding some of that legal context, I guess it gets uncomfortably misfocused and I think what we want to do is stay on what the Commission's responsibility to the statutes is. I wanted to get back to Katie's presentation and understand, so DHHL has this privilege in designated and non-designated areas, some of it is unexercised, much of it is paper water. What are the implications for the matters coming before us? I know we've had the Waimea Watershed matter which is going to be the next action item. There are these proposals for Maui and Molokaʻi, everyone's going to have their claim and DHHL being one of them, that need to be balanced a little bit differently than multiple permitees. Am I understanding that correctly? Is that the way we should be thinking about it from your perspective?
Can you just articulate the specific question you have?
Mostly I'm trying to mirror back that I'm understanding kind of what we need to take away from this presentation, that we need to understand that DHHL has this particular ability to make reservations in both designated and undesignated areas, and that we need to factor it in. But DHHL is not just another permit applicant, right? So, how do we as Commissioners need to be weighting things? I think that's some of what the other Commissioners have been trying to get at.
I think you're absolutely correct. One of the major takeaways from this presentation, like you said, DHHL as one public trust use of water does have priority. How we figure out a way to balance that with other both public trust uses of water and other reasonable and beneficial uses of water is something that needs to be discussed and will come up more as we see less water availability in certain areas, impacts of climate change, what have you. The presentation also mentions that DHHL has approximately 15% of paper water, but there's more needed, so you're right. There is going to need to be more conversations about what those needs look like and ways that we can better collaborate not only with DHHL but with the counties to better understand how we can, if maybe the county has the ability to provide water to DHHL, how we spread out that duty of not just the infrastructure to make sure that DHHL uses have adequate supplies. Does that kind of answer your question or get at kind of the context of the presentation?
I think so and I want to have a little bit [inaudible] since it's an informational briefing, not an action item. Let me back up, when I started on the Commission in 2021 we were talking about Molokaʻi and Maui and there were some interesting proposals that I remember DHHL bringing up that were a bit more holistic than the normal permit applicant, about their investment, the recognition of scarce water, their interest in investing also in watershed protection. Maybe this is for Ayron, personally I don't view things as just a zero-sum game, some things are maxed out, but there's also room for innovation and I think some of that conversation had come up on Maui. I remember Commissioner Meyer brought up R1 and R1 use is coming up again. How do we slice the pie in equitable ways, but also try and innovate and expand or conserve? Sure, we deal with permits and allocation but what are the things we can also be supporting as a Commission as we think about the needs that are outstripping supply? Ayron, can you remind us again where are the spaces, where we need to focus some energy and attention on?
I will just comment about, DHHL has a reservation on the Big Island in the Māhukona aquifer system, but they have broader regional needs that can't just be met from the one aquifer. In developing an interim instream flow standard for Waikoloa Stream, for example, the South Kohala drinking water system, which diverts almost the entirety of Kohākōhau and Waikoloa Streams to provide for drinking water supply, the County's water system could be used to meet portable needs that may have originally been met with a reservation from groundwater. This is where we are considering establishing an instream flow standard to protect instream values, but then there are also other public trust uses that could be met or should be met with the same water essentially or from the same source, especially since the stream diversions that feed the system are on DHHL land. It's kind of a little bit full circle in that the resources that could be used to meet DHHL’s needs should be in the consideration of the establishment of an action to protect the resource. I don't know if that answers your question or not.
I want to remind Commission members that another public trust purpose is domestic uses of the general public. That's never been tested. I assume that means public water supply systems, but public water supply systems also provide agriculture and industrial use uses. That's going to be a really thorny question about what part of that is a part of this.
Water to Hawaiian Homes, as well. Water to Hawaiian Homes beneficiaries, as well.
Sure, all I'm saying is that aside from the DHHL reservations, domestic uses of the general public is an equal [inaudible] as is the resource itself. Down the road, none of us will be around, but that's going to bump heads and you're going to have to come to some kind of compromise about not everybody can get all the water they want and particularly on the stream. Not all streams are going to have to be [inaudible]. Now, aquifers are a different question. You get beyond the sustainable yield and you start to permanently destroy the aquifer, so that's going to be a different issue.
I'd like to ask again, do we have a duty to make reservations for other public trust users and you said you didn't know? Could you find an answer to that question, could you research that? I mean I'm not sure the Commissioners have time to do that and the resource of the...
I can reframe my response. I don't think it's accurate to say I don't know, I think that there is a duty definitely to public trust uses of water and to find a reasonable, when we have to balance reasonable and beneficial use as well. I think that there's a lot more to say on that topic and that's definitely something that if you want us to investigate, we can definitely do that, to come up with a more formal opinion if that's something that the Commission is interested in.
I think it'd be very helpful if you could characterize that for us and get a comprehensive opinion in that respect because as Larry said, it's going to come up and it's going to come at us four square at some point with respect to surface water and groundwater, as well. Further, you mentioned that 15% of DHHL needs are being met by current reservations, if I have that correct. Where does that number come from?
That 15% is reflected in what we would consider paper water, not all of that is what we would call wet water and I could maybe defer to Andrew again to provide more details.
You don't know where the numbers come from, you didn't prepare that number yourself?
That is the number provided by DHHL.
I see, okay it's from DHHL. You answered that question for me, thank you.
When we calculate our reservation requests to the Water Commission, it's really based off of our Island Plans. As you folks know, the Hawaiian Homes Commission has exclusive land use authority over Hawaiian Homelands. Our Island Plans articulate our Commission's land use policy for our land, so are we going to use it for residential, are we going to use it for ag, are we going to use it for commercial? Our water reservations are based in large part on our Island Plans. We've made reservations for portions of our lands, but not all of our lands so that's where that number came from.
In calculating that number, it's interesting, it's kind of a gross number and were other sources considered in looking at that only 15% being available in terms of the public water systems that are available? Public utilities and that sort of thing which is where the majority of Hawaiian Homes beneficiaries get their water today? Or was that ignored and just saying, okay we need that reservation just as an estimate of the total quantity of water that DHHL beneficiaries will need going forward, do you know?
If I understand your question correctly, I believe the Water Code says that our reservations are for both current and future needs of water. When we designate our lands for residential, it's normally based off of the usual county municipal standards of 600 gallons per lot per day, so we will designate say 10 acres for residential and we'll do a back of the order envelope calculation of how many lots at say 5,000 square feet or 75,000 square feet that we can get from that area and that's what we base our estimate.
I understand, but I’m talking about where is it coming from. What’s the source? Did you assume that any of that would come from the public utility or county sources?
I think in certain locations where the county system is within close proximity to our lands then the assumption is we will try to work with the municipality.
Do you know for sure? Is that taken into account in the 15% or not?
Do we know for sure if the county has...
In other words, does the 15% assume that other public sources would be providing water to DHHL properties?
When we calculate our reservations, it's based on what is needed for homesteading.
I understand, what you're saying is it doesn't. 
Yeah, that's your responsibility as the Water Commission. COMMISSIONER MEYER: I hear you, okay thanks.
Andrew, when you say it's based upon the Island Plans, what's the time frame? Is that when you're ready to build? Because we say Water Code is past, present, and future, so what is your time frame?
That's an excellent question. Our Island Plans for our administrative rule is a 20-year outlook on what we can or hopefully can develop assuming that we receive sufficient funding for developments.
Are the reservations based upon a future estimate up to 20 years?
Yes, because it's based on our Island Plans and our Island Plans have a 20-year outlook.
I guess this is water staff, so when we have to have make the hard questions about water allocations, we take their reservations as is whether they are ready to build or not. Do we distinguish between whether it’s a DHHL residential use or DHHL industrial commercial use? Is there a distinction? Is it just if DHHL’s reservations we take them as a whole or do we distinguish the types of use as we would for example public trust?
Their calculation is dependent on their land use plans and then just comes up with that number, we don't make that...
Okay, so we take it as DHHL reservations, but Andrew do you guys distinguish when you submit to us? Is there a difference between domestic and commercial?
We do try to identify for the Commission staff what our reservation amount is based off of and again that's per our land uses. We do distinguish our residential demand, our agricultural demand, our commercial demand. The reservations that we have submitted to the Water Commission to date have been primarily for our homesteading purposes, either residential, agriculture or pastoral.
There's a comment that you made that, well maybe I should ask the question. Who pays for the water infrastructure, who pays for the delivery of water?
I think that is a question that we would like to know the answer, as well. Anecdotally, we've had some good working relationships with various counties of water supply. We continue to have dynamic conversations with them on how to fulfill the obligation of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act as a responsibility of the entire State, not just the Hawaiian Home Lands Department. We do feel that there is some level of collaboration and contribution needed from all parties. What that looks like is on a case- by-case basis.
Because do you include the cost of infrastructure when you're doing your development plans? Is the cost of developing a water infrastructure system part of your cost estimate?
Yes, when we develop our cost estimates it's both for on-site and off- site infrastructure.
That's great.
That's a really good point, this is all about collaboration, working together, and sharing. Absolutely.
Hi Andrew, I guess to help sharpen Commissioner Meyer's question is that if the water supply for your development is coming from a public water utility, are you then sort of double dipping or double accounting for that water? Because the public Department of Water has a supply plan, a demand plan. You are submitting a water demand plan, as well. You don't need to answer that right away, but as you start getting into your development to again identify that to help us help planning, not to double account for the water.
Thanks for that question, Commissioner Katayama. We have been a lot more progressive and proactive in trying to reach out to the county Department of Water Supplies to make sure that their Water Use and Development Plan is inclusive of our water developments. A great example is actually on the Kauaʻi County Department of Water Supply, they've worked really well with us in trying to outreach to our beneficiaries. They sat down with us, they went through the effort of planning meetings specifically for our beneficiaries to make sure that their input is included in their Water Use and Development Plan.
That's great and I think we'll get smarter and sharpen our focus on these things and Katie, thank you very much for your presentation. It really helped me zero in on specific statutes on how water reservations are made. One sort of comment is that you've identified several different water plans from resources, projects and if you were to look at the dates of when those plans were adopted, you find a sort of a long period. I guess my question is, is there a way to better synchronize the plans because it seems that we're dependent on a lot of these plans from the county, Water Use and Development Plan to the Water Protection Plan. I mean all of these should be used and living plans and some of these things are like 10 years old.
That is a requirement, it just doesn't get done on a timely basis.
Is there a process to do a better synchronization of these plans?
It's definitely a comment we've heard before in terms of the updates to these various components of the Hawaiʻi Water Plan and how to get them more in sync because as you mentioned, they should be communicating with one another and they're being referenced by each other. If you have one that’s outdated...
That's how decisions are being made by each of them.
Exactly. As part of our update to the Hawaii Water Plan framework which I know we are a little delinquent in getting before you, that is something that we hope to address in that framework document to provide better guidance on how we do that.
You’re the conductor.
I think I remember that cascade of planning that gets done is like painting the Golden Gate Bridge. By the time you get to the end of it, you got to go back because the first part of it all changed.
The last piece is always the timing piece.
It falls off. It's a challenge, but I know you folks do your best and what I'm hearing though is that you do your plans for 20-year horizon and so the new infusion which is a sentinel event of 600 billion and so forth that your chair was trying to leverage like crazy is not changing. I think you guys came in 2018 and we did your reservations on the basis of your current and foreseeable needs at 2018. That is fairly unchanged by the new event of having more money? Or now that you just have some money to implement more of the plans that you had or are you accelerating your plan?
Thank you for the question. I think it's a combination of both. It's accelerating the lands that we already have. To your point, our chairman has been very adamant about looking at adding new lands to our inventory, lands that are not far and remote like the original lands that we did receive. He's been looking at lands closer to infrastructure so that we can connect to the counties. To your point, like my colleagues in planning, we do update our plans on a regular basis, as well. We do have our own cascading diagram of our planning system but our Island Plans are due for an update. Our Hawaiʻi Island Plan was adopted by our Commission in 2002 and we're currently going through that planning process to update it, including the new acquisitions that the Department is acquiring on that particular island. We'll go through a similar process for all of our islands, including the new acquisitions that the recent $600 million gift from the Legislature has allowed us to acquire new lands across the State.
I would avoid using the word “gift” because it goes back to...
Obligation.
...Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani's point and I think it would serve this Commission well to have a discussion of where that trust relationship comes from. I think we all have certain assumptions and certain knowledge, but there's a history here of obligation, not just it's nice or it's a concession to the host culture and so forth. There are obligations made. I appreciate, going back to the question of double dipping and so forth, the chair now has been really thoughtful by getting infill parcels like the one in Kailua that was just acquired and Waipoli on Kauaʻi and so forth near existing infrastructure. In that case, you don't double dip and have a reservation for that and then draw your resource from the county system, it's drawn from the county system and is not included in the reservation?
I think I'm going back to the point in Katie's presentation about what a reservation is. It's simply an acknowledgement that in certain aquifers or in certain surface water management areas, that the Department will require a certain amount of water. How that water gets conveyed to the DHHL lands, the reservation doesn't touch that. It just simply says that Water Commission acknowledges and reserves this water for the use of Hawaiian Home Lands. We still have to have conversations about how we get wet water to Hawaiian Home Lands, so that's often times in current practice done through conversations with Department of Water Supplies, through water development agreements in other far remote areas with private water system owners. It also should be noted we do own and operate four water systems, ours just being on Molokaʻi where we service about 400 customers and we also service customers off of Hawaiian Home Lands like the airport, the high school. We much rather prefer to work with county Department of Water Supplies to provide service to our areas. As through our own experience, owning and operating a water system is a very challenging task.
Not your core business. ANDREW CHOY: Correct.
But of the reservations we have in place, how much of that is paper water did you say?
That's a good question, we'll have to look at in how many places where our reservations have been converted to wet water.
I think it would be good information to have and just speaks to the challenge of fulfilling the mission of the Hawaiian Homes trust, that the land set aside to fulfill that were generally remote and without infrastructure. We're supposed to put Hawaiians on homes, but then we have to pay all the cost of developing the infrastructure, except we're calling new strategies of, let's go where the infrastructure is and acquire land that may not have come to us in the original trust. That's why it's so long delayed that it takes forever to utilize the reservations we put aside from you because you're out in Kaʻū or you're out in some remote area.
Maybe that does need to be part of the conversation earlier on when we make these reservation requests come before us, is to think more holistically about where the water actually will be coming from.
Good point.
There is a mechanism for addressing the double dipping, say that DHHL has a reservation for X amount of water and then over the years, part of that is being satisfied by public water systems. When you get to a point where you've maxed out the use at least on paper, the Commission will be starting to look at the actual allocation and uses of the permits in a particular area and we have the authority to reduce and reallocate. At that point in time, DHHL will say, well 30% of our reservation is being met by public water systems, so why don't you just reduce our reservation by that amount or at least if you resist, we can do it. But it harms nobody to keep that reservation when part of it is being met by public water systems and the issue only comes up when we're bumped up against the limit. I don't see a problem with a potential double dipping. One last comment is that your current head, Kali Watson has come full circle. He was in the cabinet when I was in the cabinet.
I asked him the other day, were you on board? He said he was in high school.
26 years ago and he's still going. He must have been a very young man when he was with me.
