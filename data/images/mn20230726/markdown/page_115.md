lens, it's gonna be a different -- different set of limiting circumstances. So the study that I have done, the study that we've done, it's a group of people, demonstrated that we can use things like groundwater modeling, we can also have other kinds of studies that can assess, that can quantify the impacts of groundwater -- of groundwater withdrawal and that will then, in turn, help you determine what the groundwater availability is. So it's a -- it's kind of a question, a chicken-and-egg question. To know how much groundwater is available, we first -- the scientists need to know first how much change are you willing to accept? How much of a consequence are you willing to accept?

COMMISSIONER MIIKE: Okay. I guess I'm not getting through to you. What I want to know is that based on what you've been presenting, are we gonna have to change the sustainable yield of the aquifers, like, for example, on Oâ€˜ahu?

DR. IZUKA: I think you will have to change the method.

COMMISSIONER MIIKE: And then my secondary question on that was, what was the timeframe of that change?

DR. IZUKA: As -- okay, that is -- I guess that's -- would be a groundwater management problem.
