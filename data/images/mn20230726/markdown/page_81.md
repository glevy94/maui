Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam Drinking Water System" by Dr. Roger Brewer. Has the Navy, the commission read this? 

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** I'll admit not in its full entirety. 

**MS. GORMAN-CHANG:** Oh, okay. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you so much. 

And I think the report shows that jet fuel is not the only thing that should be tested. The report and presentation reveal level -- the levels and seriousness of exposure that families endured regarding several chemicals in addition to JP5, and they continue to experience. To me, it is evidence of the US Navy's mishandling and lack of ability, lack of supervision of their contractors, lack of emergency preparedness to deal in any way with the November 2021 jet fuel, deicing agent, and solvents and other chemicals that were leaked into the drinking water system and ingested and inhaled by countless military and civilian households. I think the latest evidence and analysis shows without a doubt that the US Navy cannot be trusted to manage any water system without strong and continual oversight by the commissions. The most recent TFA leaks is further evidence of this mismanagement. 

Commissioners, this happened on your watch and continues to evolve and unfold on your watch. Commissioners, you are not the helpless orchestra that played as the Titanic.
