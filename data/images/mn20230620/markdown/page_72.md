MR. ARAKAKI: Correct. All of the testing of these systems that we're specifying are done by the manufacturer, and they follow guidelines of, let's say, New Jersey and other jurisdictions. So they need to meet the water quality treatment requirements that were established. This is all approved by EPA and then passed down to Department of Health, and then on to the City and County as part of their NPDES program. So at this time, there's no requirement to look at or measure the pollutants that enter the system and leave the treatment system.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Okay. No, that's fine. A different conversation, but thank you.

CHAIR CHANG: I know -- Russell, I'm sure this is much more than you had thought you were gonna get into.

CHAIR CHANG: He's like, Am I here for the (inaudible)? No, we appreciate you, your patience, and, you know, answering our questions.

Any more questions, comments, Commission?

(No response.)

CHAIR CHANG: Anybody else, Kathy, in the audience?
