Modification of Existing Delegation to the Chairperson, Dated December 19, 2023, to Approve Certain Well Construction and Pump Installation Permits by Limiting the Delegation to Certain Circumstances When the Well is in Compliance with the Hawai‘i Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards and for Pumps Less than 27 Gallons Per Minute and Delegation to the Deputy Director for Other Groundwater Permit-Related Approvals Including Acceptance of Applications for Initial Review, Permit Extensions, and Well Completion Reports and Certificates.
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Ryan Imata, Groundwater Regulation Branch Chief
Staff recommended revisions to the delegations to approve well and pump permits, set by the Commission at its December 19, 2023 meeting, after the Commission’s directive to consult with the Departments of Water Supply.
Just to summarize then, basically any household domestic wells are below the line. That's why you picked the 27 (gallons per minute), right?
And second, even if the delegation is given, in individual cases, that still comes to the Commission. When for example, what you're talking about, there’s a cross between aquifers and surface water, etc. It's not an absolute delegation, it's sort of a routine delegation with exceptions, which when things arise on a particular application.
Yeah, I was trying to identify any permits in the 27 years that I've been here, looking at where I think that there are going to be concerns. I would love to focus more of our effort on where I think that there are potentials for impacts to other resources or other users or traditional and customary practices or whatever. I think this is a good balance between filtering out things like individual domestic uses where the use is so small, relative to sustainable yield, but bringing to you the issues that are much bigger.
Thanks, Ryan, for this. I’m trying to read the esoteric document that is the Hawaiʻi Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards. I notice it was revised in 2004, but that's not referenced. You told us about the establishment in 1997, is there anything to note about that 2004 revision? I'm just going to say approval by the chairperson was noted about 40 times, so there was a lot of delegation already in that document. Can you kind of explain?
I can't speak to the specifics of the differences between the 1997 and 2004 standards, but I know at the time that we first implemented the standards, we were having a lot of comments from drillers and developers and I think just the general public about things that needed clarification. I don't think the 2004 standards necessarily revised anything from a policy procedural standpoint, I think it was more details about construction, construction details that were amended. The delegations in and of themselves were kind of a clarification of the more routine things that we do, and not specifically permit delegations. I hope that answers your question.
Not quite how I read it, but I'm not a lawyer. The second question I had was around recommendation one. Ota Well was just on our radar, so I was going back and recalling that there were eight alternative actions for Keauhou non-designation and the first of those was, “the Commission will refer all well permit applications to ʻAha Moku.” There's a clearly delineated process and so how would this proposed recommendation - I mean it doesn't seem to address that there are specific, close-to-designation areas that may be important for us to consider or for there to be a public process on. One, because it's already established that for Keauhou, there is a need to address the well construction or it says, “all permits.” How are we folding that in? I was going to suggest an amendment there, but how are you considering the regional specifics?
That's a good question. Here is the thing about Keauhou, and I can't tell you the answer to this, but I think there have been some statements, specific to Ota Well, that there was nothing in the eight requirements that required us to bring it to the Commission. But in my recommendation, I think where the Chair feels that there are things that the Chair wants to make sure that there's public disclosure on and the opportunity for public input on, we can take it to the Commission. Basically, what I'm proposing is not saying that everything blanket, gets delegated to the Chair. There are opportunities and I think Keauhou is one of them where the Chair can take the approval of the well permit and/or the pump permit to the Commission. Again, it's just very specific to the area, but like I said, I think most of the concerns related to the quantity of water and the potential for threats are first covered by the fact that most of those areas are designated Water Management Areas, so all of those are going to come to the Commission anyway.
Sorry, what I was referring to was places that are maybe near to designation or not designated. Just for the record I'll refer to February 14, 2017 - eight criteria were proposed as following actions as alternatives to designation. “The Commission will refer all well permit applications to the ʻAha Moku system for review and recommendations to protect traditional and customary practices that are exercised and may be affected by the proposed application. If traditional and customary practices are found in the proposed permit area that may be affected by the proposed action, special conditions will be suggested to mitigate the impact of proposal. If the well operator and land owner do not agree, then the staff will present applications to the Commission for decision making pursuant to HRS 174C-84(f) and HAR §13-168-12(h).” I guess I just want to understand if we decide this, how do these two sort of decisions - just put like some address that there are certain areas that we will need to have more discretion on and not leave it up to the Chair who comes and goes and may or may not know about certain hotpots.
I do see what you're saying in terms of, does this delegation supersede that. We can maybe add in some language in there to say that this doesn't supersede areas where there are the Commission imposed requirements for things to come to the Commission. I agree.
I have a question about the delegation. I understand that the proposal is to delegate to the Chair, I understand that. My question is, is this ministerial versus rulemaking? So it's a legal question. The other question I have, along the lines of what Aurora was mentioning which is, is there a certain criteria that is part of the recommendation for the Chair to make that determination as to what comes to the Commission? For the Department of Health, we have a statute that says if it is in the public interest to bring something to require a public hearing, the director may require a public hearing on a permit issue and in the statute itself it sets forth some criteria. It's a legal issue, I think, but I'm wondering how we would address that?
Good question.
No, go ahead. I'm not the attorney here. COMMISSIONER HO: In this case, I'm not either.
And I'm not rendering a legal opinion either, but quite frankly that's why I brought this to the Commission in December 2023 because I just felt that in light of the comments that we were receiving- and this came up in Hāpuna about traditional and customary practices, 343, that there seemed to be a question as to, shouldn't this be a matter that's really brought before the Water Commission? Not just delegated to the Chairperson. I think staff has tried to attempt to craft exceptions. I don't know if I would necessarily say it's ministerial because there are discretionary provisions that may be triggered. I think Aurora's comment is a really good one that there should be maybe a 1C that says something recognizing that where there are Commission decisions or determinations, that does not waive the Commission's right to oversee this. So something to that effect because I too, I felt really uncomfortable with this sort of unlimited delegation and that was more because I wasn't as familiar. I also thought that there are some things that should be brought out to the larger public. I think Ryan is talking also about the Ka Paʻakai Analysis, having greater guidance that can provide staff the opportunity. Also the public website - creating an opportunity where everybody can see all applications. Now whether that at least provides another opportunity for the public to know what permits the Commission may be looking at or the staff may be looking at. Balancing that against looking at all of the testimony that came primarily from the water departments, recognizing we've got to find a balance between how do we facilitate some of these smaller requests versus how do we differentiate those that do require greater review in a public forum by the Water Commission.
I was just going to ask, historically, how have we handled all of these delegations? Has it been rulemaking or has it been ministerial?
It's been through board action. The board has authorized... COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: So we are consistent with this action today?
Yes, I'm assuming that previously they were consulting with the Attorney General's office and the delegation was not rulemaking. I will say for the Land Board as well, there’s a lot of just delegating to the Chairperson to negotiate a contract or 343. I don't believe this is rulemaking.
I think the delegation itself is one action and I don't think that is rulemaking. I think we have the authority to delegate to you and that's not rulemaking. It's maybe some other aspects of it which is what criteria, and there's a body of cases which is why I thought it is a legal call, but there are a body of cases where internally the police department or an agency can set forth different criteria and that is not considered rulemaking. I just didn't know where we sit. The delegation I'm clear about, but where we sit on some other aspects of this request like 27 gallons per minute, like when the Chair is able to decide what should go to the greater Commission, those kinds of things. There are cases that address this which I'm just not familiar with.
Are you suggesting that we also seek Deputy Attorney General counsel on this before we take an action? Or Colin?
Let me ask the question another way. Are you okay with the recommendations that are explicitly stated here that there are delegations subject to certain exceptions?
I'm okay with the delegation itself. I think we can delegate to the Chair, I'm okay with that. It's the exceptions that I'm on the fence on whether we have the authority on the exceptions or do we have to do something more. In my former life, I remember that body of cases, I'm just not as familiar with that line of cases at this point and what I don't want us to do is to act on something and then get...
So it's not the fact that we’re making these exceptions, it's the fact how we do it, how we implement that.
And whether we have the authority versus rulemaking. I'm just interested if to see if the staff has researched this, if our attorney general has some thought on this.
I think that's a valid question regarding whether the Chairperson, in its discretion to say, oh no I don't think this is of public interest, I'm not going to you know. I understand.
I really don't like what's happening here which is we're starting to get into such details of a delegation that it's going to be meaningless. The other thing is that I don't know of any bar that says we have to, if we're going to delegate, we have to delegate absolutely. We're only talking about delegating part of a decision making or a way of looking at things. I think it's irrelevant that we have to carve out exceptions and then we have to maybe look at rulemaking when we talk about delegation. When we want to delegate, we're going to delegate and I don't see any problems with delegating authority. Again, as I say, I'm concerned if we get into too much detail about what we're delegating, I'm fine with the language here and from the presentation that was given, the explanation is satisfactory to me.
Let me ask you, Ryan, did you consult with the Attorney General's office on this matter?
No, but, Colin, I think you guys did review the submittal and I was trying to make sure that anything that was delegated wasn't - how do I say this? The delegation is for approval, so there's some discretion in what's delegated, but I was trying to take out the discretion so that I was being very specific about which things get delegated. Again, I can't comment on the legality of that, but I think if the Commission approved the specificity with which things have to go back to the Commission...I wasn't aware that that was a legal issue.
I'm here, thank you. Good morning Chair, aloha Commissioners. For the record my name is Roy Hardy, formerly Groundwater Protection manager for the Water Commission. I didn't really want to get into too much detail. I know I only got three minutes, but I was very happy to hear the discussion that the Commission was going through primarily about the issue of is this rulemaking or not. Just a little bit of background of some of the statements that were made and questions that were asked. Kagawa-Viviani brought up, I didn't even know, 40 times that delegation was mentioned in the 2004 Hawaiʻi Construction Standards. The 1997 and 2004 updates, there was a lot of public information meetings, meetings with the public, meetings with all the drillers. There were presentations at conferences all about these things and there was a lot of input. These took years to arrive at, these details, there are a lot of them, very complex. Some of the examples I was reading through in the submittal about this cross connection issue, it sounds like it's something new, it isn't. It's addressed already in the construction standards. Saltwater wells need to be solid casing all the way down to saltwater and grouted all the way through the freshwater to protect the basal aquifer. Similarly, if there's cross connections with perched aquifers while you're going down the fine basal aquifers, that needs to be closed off and those are in the sections of casing and grouting, as well. I was a little bit scratching my head on that, but all these details aside, it seems like and I was happy to hear this thing - is this rulemaking- because this is going to affect everyone, especially when you're delegating with these exceptions. The first exception I can tell you - 1A, wells that penetrate to discrete water bodies. That happens a lot everywhere, almost. Almost all the wells on Kauaʻi that happens, it's an old island so there's a lot of layers of low permeability where you run through and there are a lot of perched aquifers, confined aquifers. In East Maui, there's lots of perched aquifers. On the Big Island, Keauhou, there's lots as well. Overall, this seems like if you're going to make these kind of distinctions and exceptions, it really sounds more like an update to the Construction Standards themselves. If that's what's being sought here, if there's special cases so kind of a rulemaking thing. I would agree with what was discussed that maybe the AG should weigh in, sorry Colin, about whether this approach really is rulemaking.
Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani brought up Keauhou and all these conditions. Well, that's a special case because of the non-designation, so that's not really rulemaking. I think the first condition she read out was this collaborating, talking with ʻAha Moku and bringing construction permits and pump installation permits in the non-designated area if conditions that were discussed were not agreeable to the applicant. You actually had an example of that and that's why that special condition was put into the non-designation proceedings and accepted by the Commission of the Kohanaiki project which is right next door to the national park. Just through the regular process, the delegated process and discussing the applications, what came to be agreed upon by all the parties was, hey, put in these monitor wells, three monitor wells. They were put in and they're there and I think they've provided very good information which actually helped with the designation proceedings, as well. That was just codifying that special situation in Keauhou and especially with the interest in designation. I don't think that's a rule, it's just, here's this special place that there's a lot of concern and able to arrive at reasonable accommodations and conditions with the applicants and the people of that place. Again, I think my time is used up here but I do like the question - is this overall approach rulemaking or not? That's kind of my question, thank you.
Aloha Commissioners, Andrew Choy with the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL). The Department appreciates the opportunity to provide testimony on these items or this particular agenda item. First off, the Department was not consulted on this matter. We appreciate the importance the role that the Department of Water Supply’s have in water development and delivery in Hawaiʻi and are glad that they were considered. The Department is both a water purveyor and public trust use of water, we however, were not consulted. We were aware of the agenda item when the agenda was posted and had access to the submittal on Monday which was also our Commission meeting. As Ryan acknowledged in his presentation, he did reach out to Dr. Scheuer over the weekend, but it wasn't really sufficient time for us to really digest this submittal and process its implications on the Department's ability to provide water to its beneficiaries. CWRM staff conversely worked hand-in-hand with us well over a month on another agenda item on your agenda today, so it can be done to reach out to the Department in advance, well in advance of this presentation. Also, secondly on transparency for DHHL and other public trust users and the general public is still an issue. We appreciate that the submittal raises the importance of public information and transparency, however the recommended action especially to the extent that expanded areas of delegation to the chair depend on notice in the water resource bulletin, I think Ryan also acknowledged maybe posting these applications online. That is a good solution, but I think other solutions for transparency can also be explored, as well. Delegation removes due process for the expanded areas for delegation, well construction permits, certain pump installation permits. This will remove due process for the Department and its beneficiaries in all instances except when we are the applicant. Cumulative impacts are not addressed. While exempting some small domestic wells can make sense, even in those cases the cumulative impacts of multiple wells should somehow be addressed. This could be significant adverse impact to the Department and other public trust uses of water. Efficiency is a worthy goal, but the submittal lacks some quantification of the problem and proposed solution. For instance, it could talk about how many of these permits come before staff each year over maybe the last 5 years and if this action were to be approved by the Commission, what the expectation on the time to process the permits. What is the difference in time, how much time do we hope to save by this. I don't think that was clearly communicated so I don't know the extent of the issue based on what was presented and whether or not this is an adequate solution to address the issue. The Department does suggest deferral of this matter until these issues would allow for further review and analysis by the Commission and its staff, however we understand that there are other differences of perspective and discussion among Commission as well as other public testimony. In the absence of a deferral, some of the Department's concerns could be addressed by modifying proposed action to add an ‘F’ to the A - E list of pump installation permits that are not delegated as follows. By adding an item F, pumps in aquifers where the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands has a water reservation, we would like to see added as one of the exceptions, should a deferral not happen today. Thank you again for the time to testify and if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer.
Thank you, Andrew. I appreciate your recommendation. You indicated that there may be other methods of notice. Did you have another suggestion?
I think posting it online, posting it in the water bulletin, those are good first steps. I think other methods could be the environmental notice. I think that receives a greater deal of circulation availability. Posting it in the newspaper, public notice, taking out an ad in the Ka Wai Ola newsletter that OHA (Office of Hawaiian Affairs) produces, another form. I do think there are other ways to get the word out and be more transparent, but those are just some recommendations off the top of my head.
Thank you very much for that.
Thank you. You make a good point that presumably, we're doing this to make the process more efficient, but that really hasn't been explained and addressed in the report. For Ryan, perhaps, to respond. If something has to come to the Commission, what's the typical time frame for approval versus if we delegate this? How efficient would the system be? Can you help us understand the benefit as to what we gain from delegation?
I can tell you that our statutory deadline for approval of permits is 90 days, regardless of whether it comes to the Commission or whether it's delegated approval to the Chair. The problem with bringing all applications to the Commission is we have to take the time to draft the submittal and prepare all of the documentation for wells that comply with the well standards. I think that that would increase our processing time and it has increased our processing time quite significantly. I'm going to add to and I don't know that this is necessarily pertaining to the delegation in and of itself, but groundwater regulation branch is severely understaffed at this point. For the amount of things that we are tasked with right now, which includes the newly designated Lahaina and potentially Waiʻanae designation, in addition to now having to bring all well permits to the Commission. It not only adds a time component to our ability to process, it takes away our ability to really focus our efforts on areas where I think that there are significant concerns and significant potential impacts to resources including traditional and customary practices. I'll identify two of them. One of them is in the north sector of Oʻahu where there are really a lot of concerns about these large residential units on agricultural land coming up. I think that's something that we need to focus our efforts on to bring to you guys so that decisions can be made in a more open and meaningful way. The other one is out in Kūkiʻo on the Big Island where we have a brackish lens that we do have concerns about the lens potentially becoming saltier. Those are areas that I want to focus our efforts on to make sure that we're providing the adequate protection. Every time I bring a Hawaiian Paradise Park well to you for approval that is like 0.005% of sustainable yield, takes away the ability for Groundwater Regulation Branch to focus on things that are more important. So there's not only the time commitment, there's also the ability for us to focus our efforts where I think that there are concerns.
Point taken. Thank you, Ryan.
If I remember correctly this issue came up because Chair was concerned about an open-ended delegation and this is an attempt to restrict the delegation. What's happened in the past? I don't know of anything that's happened in the past that the old system of delegation was leading to some problems. All I hear now is people are concerned about because it's been brought out in the open that we want to sort of restrict the delegation. It seems backwards that here we are trying to restrict the delegation and people are concerned about how we're restricting the delegation where in the past it's been an open-ended delegation.
Another question. Along those lines, Ryan, you mentioned that we have 90 or that you have 90 days to issue a permit. Is the consequence if you don't issue the permit within 90 days, it will be deemed approved or what is it? I know there's a statute.
I've been reading a lot of your guys’ rules, the Department of Health rules lately and I noticed that there is an automatic approval if something isn't reviewed and approved within a statutory deadline. We don't have any of that in the HRS or the HAR so the read from our AG's office, and again I don't know if... The answer from our Deputy AGs has been that automatic approval isn't done because of lack of adherence to that 90-day statutory deadline.
So what's the consequence, Ryan, if you don't approve it in 90 days? RYAN IMATA: There is no consequence.
I just wondered why, I wondered why you said you had to approve it within 90 days. I thought there was a consequence.
As much as possible, we try to follow the law. I mean that's our job is to make sure that we follow the law. Unfortunately, again with the change in delegation and a lot of the changes that are happening, I don't think it's stated enough to the Commission that Groundwater Branch has extreme challenges with getting things done. I’m looking at who is here to testify, I see Barry is here. I know that there's been a lot of push back, there have been a lot of people that call me that you guys aren't aware about that are pretty upset about the process taking so long and how this delegation adds to that concern for time. On the one hand, I do understand the ability to provide an opportunity for public input, I respect the fact that there are changes that have happened since 1997, but I'm looking at it from the perspective of trying to make sure that I focus the things that you guys need to see and the important issues and taking away the things that I think are much more routine and ministerial in terms of people complying with those and not needing to go to you guys for approval. That's all my concern is.
Ryan, I believe at one time you did some statistics. What is a total number of Well Construction and Pump Installation permits and because I think hearing Andrew's comments about...so what's the issue you have? You're saying that there's so many permits and that you're not able to dedicate the time to the harder issues. So out of the total permits, how many permits would fall under this number one where it meets the standards? Because you had given to me some statistics on Hawaiian Paradise that you said something like over 50% of all the well permits come from Hawaii Paradise. Am I making that up or is that true?
No, that's very true and in fact, ‘Iwalani or Dean, can you allow me to share screen because I can't share screen right now. Still can’t. Okay, here we go. While the discussion was going on, I just did a super quick report from our database about well applications that we've gotten I think since 2019. From 2019 to today, we had, I don't have a summary number, but it looks like we got about 700 applications which amounts to about a 100 per year. If you look at the aquifer codes, a lot of these are for domestic wells in Hawaiian Paradise Park. Look at the aquifer code 80801, I think 80801 is Pāhoa, Hawaiian Paradise Park, most of them. If you look at all of the pages, I have like 18 pages. I think over half of them are in Hawaiian Paradise Park, so you're right and here you didn't make that up, 50% is about right. Some of them are in Maui, this is aquifer code 6. These are on Oʻahu, 3. And again, these Oʻahu applications some of them are individual domestic, but some of them require water use permits. These are Navy monitor wells which they're constantly pushing us on and we try to address those because we know that those are necessary to really address the needs of analyzing data around the Red Hill spill. Then there's a lot of Board of Water Supply wells and Barry Usagawa is here from the Board to kind of talk about the time frame that we've been faced with trying to get these approved for them, too. Again, these are sorted by aquifer codes. Freeing up our ability by delegating all of the Hawaiian Paradise Park wells will really significantly impact our time. Again, we have other challenges, we have staffing issues, we have designation issues, we have a lot of other issues so I'm not saying that this is a blanket fix all that's going to allow us to get permits out way, way faster, but it's another layer that impacts our ability to get work done. I hope that answered your question.
Good morning, Chair and Commissioners, I guess I'll go first. We submitted testimony in support of the staff recommendations primarily because of the streamlining, just the well construction permit and administrative tax that are related as practical for administrative expedience. We make four points, one is that the staff is very knowledgeable and experienced and capable and under the direction of the director and the deputy working as a team, they determine all the conditions. Certainly the delays have been affecting our projects. It's been at least a year on a couple of them. Even delegated, I might point out that the staff still have to send the permit applications around for agency review and comment and that does take a while, in particular the State Historic Preservation Division. And while those delays are affecting us and it does affect the availability of water for affordable housing and it just exacerbates our water shortage potential from contamination, climate change, induced drought, and wildfires. The third point is that we are aware and bear the risk of the drilling of the exploratory well whether we can find a competent source of water, so we aware of those risks and also that conditions will be placed on these permits. Primarily in Oʻahu, you have like three bites of the apple actually because it's designated except for Waiʻanae, and we're working on a petition to designate Waiʻanae. But delegating the well construction permit allows us to find a competent source to the well testing, developing the information that could be then used to determine the pump installation permit, the sizing, and of course the water use permit. Those two other permits go before the Commission, so in terms of transparency in public notice, there are two other layers or two other types of processes that will do that. In particular for us to drill an exploratory well, Chapter 343, Section 5, when you use State or County funds or lands, we are required to do an environmental assessment prior to the well construction and that would disclose the environmental impacts as well as including archaeological, cultural, and Ka Paʻakai analysis. I appreciate the fact that guidelines will be worked on for Ka Paʻakai because they're really needed, I think they're a bit loose. Then you mentioned the bulletin, so there are probably other ways to notify the public and allow comment, but that's our testimony and thank you for the opportunity to provide supporting testimony and I'm available for any questions.
Good morning Commissioners, Chair Chang - Kawika Uyehara, Deputy Department of Water Supply, County of Hawaiʻi. Yes, we did submit testimony and submitted testimony in support of the staff's original submittal, but hearing some of the comments and discussion made today which is very informative, I just wanted to add a couple new comments for consideration. I guess first, if there is a revised submittal from staff then what we hope to be able to comment officially on that via the testimony process in regards to the item 1A, I believe, we recognize and acknowledge if it is a rulemaking decision or discussion that needs to occur between CWRM and the AG, we respect that. We'll let that go through that process. In regards to Keauhou, we do also recognize and acknowledge the 2017 Non- designation decision, so we fully are in agreement with following those conditions, recommendations that came out of that decision and we will abide by that. Just to put in, to add to the Keauhou conversation and we do have at least one, I think, well construction permit or application in process right now with CWRM staff and it's kind of been in the process for a couple years from what I remember. Basically, it's helping us to develop another source to reduce or to actually allow us to get off of using the basal lens sources such as Kahaluʻu shaft and some of the other basal wells that we have in the aquifer. Again, we know there's a process, we just want to make sure that everyone understands. On our side, we're trying to develop some sources just to replace some of the older basal sources so we can reduce our reliance on basal. In addition, some of you folks may know that we're trying to downsize some of our wells just so we have better operations, we can operate a little bit better with reliability. By that, we lose capacity in some of our wells. One of the well construction applications we have in now is to kind of help us restore some of that capacity that we've lost but thank you for the time and the time to provide comments, thank you.
After listening to this, I have a question for Ryan. I'm trying to remember if it came up in December, but how are we addressing that bifurcation of what happens in the designated versus non-designated? Honolulu BWS’ testimony reminded me what they confront procedurally is a little bit different. I know there's a flowchart, but does that change with this decision?
No, again I don't think anything pertaining to permit approvals changes, the only thing that changes is the delegation. I think I mentioned in this submittal that there's two sides of it, there's a side that wants the bifurcation because they want to be able to drill a well and to better assess what are going to be the hydrologic impacts of pumping the well. Because you can do a Chapter 343, you can predict a Ka Paʻakai Analysis, you can say that but until you pump a well you're not going to be able to collect data that addresses those kinds of issues. Some agencies want to have the permit bifurcated so that they can drill the well first and assess, other agencies may want to make sure that they have the well and the pump permits in hand so that they don't invest like $2 million dollars in a well and then they can't get the pump installation permit. What I'm proposing is flexible and allowing both of those to happen. In a Water Management Area, clearly to get a pump installation permit, you need a water use permit. Those things will come to the Commission anyway, so I think that addresses the bifurcation in terms of like in management areas and non-management areas and our flexibility in allowing what I think people are looking for. I hope that answers your question.
Sorry, when I said bifurcated, I kind of meant like designated and non-designated. Say I'm an applicant, my pump is less than 27 gpm (gallons per minute). Is there a clear way that we can understand what you're proposing? Like okay, so it's less than 27 and you're located in Waiʻanae - okay, well it's going to be maybe posted on the bulletin but it's not going to have to come before the Commission. Correct?
So, Waiʻanae is not a management area, right? That's what you're saying, so non-management areas.
I'm thinking about it, making it easier to understand from the permit applicant side, what that routing is.
I get that you want to make it easier, but it is a complex issue because is it a non-management area, management area? Is it a domestic use, is it a non-domestic use? Is it below 27 or is it under 27? If it's below 27 and it's for individual domestic use in a non-management area, then it's delegated approval to the Chair. If it's below 27 in a non-management area and it's used for industrial water bottling then it does come to the Commission.
I think what could be made clear is just “how this is the existing workflow” and “this is how the workflow will change” and “this is how it will improve permit processing time.” Sorry, maybe you're thinking about it in terms of your workload, but I'm thinking about it in terms of like there's a lot of text and if there is a clear diagram of the changes being suggested, I think it would be helpful. I’m not asking for it now, but if that could be as part of the staff’s four tasks like clarifying what that workflow, that modified workflow is, I think that would help in making transparent what this delegation involves. I think it's just more for like public understanding and I know you have a lot on your time, but I think it would sort of front end some of the concerns and questions, as well.
We can do that, yeah we can do that.
It would certainly help my brain, so thanks.
I would just say for the record, in December when Hāpuna came out, I would tell you I was very concerned about everything being delegated. It wasn't delegated to the Chair, it was delegated to the First Deputy. When I came on board and then hearing the concerns by Jonathan Scheuer, Kapua Sproat, and it was more process than it was substance. For me I distinguish two things - procedurally it is wanting to have transparency, wanting to make sure that our process is fair and objective. Since December to now, we've taken away the delegation to the Chair and we've given it back to the Board. I think Ryan has had comments, he's consulted apparently with like the water departments, not fully with DHHL, but you did have a conversation with Jonathan that there seems to be good recommendations that have come forward. I mean for me some of the substantive issues are being addressed in the Ka Paʻakai guidelines because there may be a difference of opinion with some of us on the Commission. I do believe that there is a requirement for Ka Paʻakai Analysis in everything we do. The scope of that analysis to me is determined based upon the action that's being proposed. There may be a big difference between an individual domestic well, less than 27 versus a water bottling use. I do think Ka Paʻakai, the issues may be different, like the 343. To a certain extent I sort of saw this as an SMA minor-major. SMA minor- there is delegation to the planning director, but it fits certain categories. I think that's what this was an attempt to do - was saying we're going to follow the Ka Paʻakai guidelines, if it follows the pump installation standards that can be delegated, I think, if the two different criteria that you put under here. I also like the one that Aurora brought up that there should be another section that says, “it shall not supersede any Commission actions including for example the Keauhou designation, eight conditions that were put on there that that should apply. In any cases where the Board has taken action, that this delegation should not supersede that, that those other conditions should be included or brought back to the Board. I also like the comment by Andrew Choy about additional forms of notice. I think even publishing an OEQC [former Office of Environmental Quality Control] bulletin, that's probably much more widely read than perhaps our own website. I’d also like us to consider, Andrew made a recommendation to amend two and adding F - pumps and aquifers where DHHL has a reservation. That seemed to be reasonable. In my mind, procedurally we've begun to address that. My concern was transparency, due process, if we're addressing notice. Substantively, it looks like the staff has come down with some criteria, whether that's rulemaking, that's another question. Obviously we're not going to be here to answer that, so Commission, your thoughts.
I’d hate for the last action I take is deferral because it feels like it's kicking a can down the road, but I wonder if you're thinking - it's the right thing to do, we need to do it right. If we deferred floating the idea of should we defer so that number one, Ryan has an opportunity to consult with DHHL. They are a public trust use, beneficial use, they should have an opportunity for meaningful consultation. Secondly, to consider the other ideas and recommendations that were made here today and other feedback that you received that you can add to the recommendations. Third, to really develop a workflow diagram that takes your 700 or 800 applications and kind of runs them through a chart that then shows how many drop off and how much more efficient you get and what you're going to focus on so that the Commission can see it, as Aurora has recommended. And fourth, consult with the AG on the correct legal process for achieving these desired.
Is that a motion?
Can we have comments on this? COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: Yeah, let's comment.
I guess I'm on the other side of the fence and that issue of whether it's rulemaking, administerial is here, but for me the issue is do we want to impede the process if we pass and adopt what's here today as amended. We can go down the road and fix it and address it as the issues arise and it gives time for further review, but it gives at least an authority to move and address these issues as presented and as discussed in a lot of detail. When I first read this document, that's where it sort of came out - is it right for adoption? But again the alternative is to do nothing and again have this issue keep rolling down the road. I guess I'm in the camp right now is that approve it with this issue. We can address it at subsequent meetings to correct it.
I have a comment about that. I'm sort of on the other side of that, I'd like to get the legal question addressed first because if we're doing something that is illegal rulemaking or whatever, that our actions that we take is subject for dissolution and so I'd rather defer and seek the counsel of our...
Is there sort of clear areas or gray areas where we are looking at in the recommendations where it is rulemaking?
Can I can get in on this? That was a question for me too which is, what are we talking about possible rulemaking? Is it the delegation for the individual...
For me it was the exceptions.
It's the exceptions? I don't understand that at all. Here we are, we have had the delegation for what, 27 years? Nothing has come up about that. There was always the flexibility of the Chair when he or she and most of the time it's been a she, have had concerns about that that was brought to the Commission for us to decide. I guess because the issue has been raised, we got to find out whether it is rulemaking or not, but from my point of view it doesn't make any sense that this is now all of a sudden the rulemaking issue has raised its head.
I totally agree with that, but for me it's the public has raised this issue as well as some of the Commission members and so it is an easy fix for us to just seek the counsel of the Attorney General's office and then we could put a period on it. Because of these cases, these lines of cases, it is not rulemaking and therefore you could go forward on your action. If we don't get that response, the opinion from the Attorney General's office, it will always be a question out there whether it is or it isn't. For me, it would be a simple question to the AG's office that they can just answer quickly, do the analysis of those cases, and say what we're doing is not illegal rulemaking.
Because Kathy, in your view, if it was just a pure delegation to the Chairperson, there would be no issues. It's the rulemaking is these conditions, these exceptions. I think in the past, Larry, the delegation has just been a blanket delegation so that's why I don't think the rulemaking issue has come up in the past because it’s been total discretion to the First Deputy and the Chairperson.
The issue of rulemaking will be germane only if someone challenges it. If nobody says anything about it being a rulemaking, the only way that the issue would come up is if someone sues the Commission to say you're doing illegal rulemaking.
But then it could potentially make us vulnerable in all of the actions that we've taken.
Wait a second, on what actions? Is it the ones that we just routinely had delegated or the ones that the exceptions were made because if it's only the exceptions that are rulemaking, it's only the exceptional cases that would be subject if the suit was successful that said you were doing illegal rulemaking. All the others, from what I understand the issue is, would be okay, right? All the ones that would be routinely approved would be okay because that's not rulemaking. Anyway, since now it's been so befuddled, how quickly can we get an answer from the Attorney General's office? Tomorrow will it come?
Can you do a subject to? Is there an option to approve this, subject to review by the Attorney General?
Then that becomes a non-action because it's conditional. What does that mean then?
The other alternative is, we could go into executive section and seek the legal advice of our attorney now.
But we’re still not done, it seems to me that there's enough hesitance that we're not going to make a decision today.
I’m off the hook.
I'd rather wait till the next meeting to make a decision even though Neil will be gone. You can have my proxy vote.
Are you going to be gone? COMMISSIONER MIIKE: No, no.
Okay, you're going to be here.
Anyway if we can make a decision the next time around, then I'm okay waiting one month but boy these things are so dragging. Everything we're doing now gets dragged out. I thought we were a decisive Commission.
The risk of somebody suing us because you're allowing more public process seems remote, but the real risk is if somehow the actions that we take to issue permits are then tainted by this confusion, then that affects some driller, some entity that's out there doing something that they think they have the authority to do, but then somebody questions whether that authority was correct. It's fruit of the tainted tree.
It just seems to me what would logically follow if this is found to be rulemaking is that all the ones that were routinely approved would be denied because the Board didn't act on it. I don't know, is the legal default position that everything that comes to the Commission has to be individually approved by the Commission? That sounds nuts that we had to actually vote on each and every one of them. That's no way to run a Commission.
No, you're right and I do think that there are frameworks upon which we can work the parameters and maybe that's what the AG's office can provide us guidance on, but I think in the past there has been no parameters. It has been a blanket delegation and that doesn't trigger rulemaking, but it triggers in my mind a tremendous amount of discretion that the Chairperson has or the First Deputy has. I wasn't comfortable with that either. Ryan, did you want to make a comment?
Just a comment that if rulemaking affects this decision or maybe there's a question- should rulemaking affect the decision that was made in December of last year, too? Because I think it's the same thing and I think that maybe if rulemaking was an issue, that should have been an issue in December, too. I just wanted to bring that up.
No, but the December decision was not to delegate, it was to bring everything back to the Commission, right?
But there were exceptions and I think that's where rulemaking is looking at the exceptions, right? I think December also had exceptions to it.
I have one last question. It's not about this, it's about - where's DHHL? We've been talking with Jonathan Scheuer just about every time we have a meeting. Is he not representing your agency?
Jonathan does represent our agency, he is human and needs a vacation so that's why staff is here.
That's why you're here now, but you were basically complaining that we had not consulted with DHHL and all along we've been talking to Jonathan. As a matter of fact, Jonathan has been very assertive about appearing before the Commission. So what is your position about when DHHL gets consulted?
I think if you look at the submittal, you can see very clearly that the Boards of Water Supply, Departments of Water Supply were clearly consulted well before this action was taken and it's documented in the submittal. We were just notified about it over the weekend over a phone call.
That's not my question. My question is that we have to formally ask every time and whenever Jonathan shows up that he's showing up as an individual person and not with DHHL? The reason I ask is that I thought we've been talking with DHHL just about at every meeting.
When Jonathan appears before the Commission, he will either announce that he's talking on behalf of the Department or not.
Yeah, as a matter fact he has done that. Okay, so what you're wanting is more inclusion in the formal process? Okay, all right, thank you.
As I understand, it's this particular item, it’s this agenda.
Correct, I think there are good examples of other collaboration between Commission staff and the Department in other arenas.
Sorry, can I add in that the December, this Commission decision specifically identified that we talk to Departments of Water Supply and come back with a decision. You guys identified that we needed to talk with Department of Water Supplies which I was trying to comply with. I also recognized that I think it would have been a good idea to reach out to Jonathan. Should I have reached out to him earlier? I mean maybe, but I did reach out to him to see if he had comments on it and I alerted him to the submittal and wanted him to be able to provide feedback today.
Chair, Keola Talaroc is also on. He had wanted to testify earlier, was having issues, but he's available now if you want.
I did close public comments, but Keola, go ahead if you wanted to provide comments.
Aloha Chair and Commissioners, my name is Keola Talaroc. I'm the drillings operation manager for Alpha Inc. I just wanted to give a perspective from the drilling contractor side because that hasn't been presented. For your guys' meetings, you guys hold them once a month. If we can achieve two permits per meeting, that would only be 24 a year. To say that that wouldn't slow down the permitting process or affect things other than just time is...what I'm trying to say, sorry...we're affecting more things by putting a lot of red tape for small wells that don't have as large of an effect. In quantity, if we have a bunch of small wells, it might have a big effect, but for how much resources we're spending to look at a well that's less than 27 gallons a minute, we could be spending that same time looking at larger wells that present possibly bigger issues. On the second hand, I also want to talk about the Ka Paʻakai Analysis and developing a framework for what we need to answer. There's a bunch of questions and it leads to things that we can't answer 100% correctly without having data. We want to be able to correctly answer these questions, but there's questions like what kind of impact do the wells have on the environment, what kind of impact do they have on near and offshore fisheries? These are things that without data, applicants, not only drilling companies but people going in for groundwater use permits, they'll have a really difficult time answering. That's all I wanted to say, thank you for letting me speak.
I appreciate you being here. Keola, can I ask you what's been the difference in the permitting time from last year December to today? Since everything has had to come before the Commission, what kind of impact has that had on your business from December 2023 to today?
I think it was leading up to December, there started to be a lot more regulation and discussion of what needs to be submitted with the permit applications. Prior to that, we did see closer to a 90 day turnaround once we got a confirmation that everything we have submitted has been reviewed and approved. It was closer than 90 days. For people to comment like ʻAha Moku and Department of Water Supply, we would see an approval or denial of a permit application. Now, it's been over a year for some of our permits that are really only asking for 25 gallons a minute. Some of them are asking for water for their livestock. Things like that, I don’t necessarily feel should be given to you guys [inaudible]. Wells that only do 25 gallons a minute for small stuff is taking up a lot of your guys valuable time where we could be talking about wells that are going to help solve greater issues like affordable and low-income housing. Those are bigger wells that are going to have a lot more usage coming out of them and that's items that you guys should really be discussing and what impacts that might have versus a guy that wants water for his horses. You guys dissect things which is very good, but I feel like we need to aim what we're dissecting because right now when customers ask when will their permit be approved, I can't give them an answer. I say it has to be presented in front of the Board and then they say, okay well what's that schedule look like? And then I have to tell them, well they meet once a month and we only get the agenda six days before the meeting. It's very difficult for people to even have an idea of a timeline and we've also been asked the question, can we do this without a permit? We're not going to do that, but that's not saying someone else won't do it and if we have people doing illegal wells, then we have no way of tracking the impacts that is happening on our aquifer. It's just for the need of water, so that's all I have.
Thank you very much, Keola. Your testimony has been very enlightening, to have real ground truthing on the impacts of our different processes. With the delegation was 90 days. Without the delegation, coming to the Commission, you're waiting for like about a year. Thank you, Keola.
