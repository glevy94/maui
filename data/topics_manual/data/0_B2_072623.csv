Item B2   
So I'm now gonna go on to Item B2. It's a briefing by the US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 1876, "Volcanic Aquifers of Hawai‘i - Contributions to Assessing Groundwater Availability on Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, Maui," presented by Scot Izuka, PhD, USGS.  
Thank you, Neil.  
Hi, Chair. Neil Fujii. Good morning, Chair and Members and (inaudible). So I'm just gonna introduce Scot Izuka, and then I'll (inaudible) his presentation. You guys probably all know Scot. Scot Izuka has been a hydrologist with the USGS Pacific Islands Water Science Center since 1989 and has conducted water resources studies in Hawai‘i, American Samoa, and Micronesia. Most of his work is in island groundwater and surface water hydrology, but he also has published research in geomorphology, climate, sedimentology, stratigraphy, geochemistry, geochronology paleontology, and paleogeography. Scot's currently the project lead for the Hawai‘i Volcanic Aquifer Study and several regional groundwater availability assessments being conducted by the USGS Water Availability and Use Science Program. Scot received a BS in geology and geophysics from the University of Hawai‘i; he received his MS in geology from the University of Kansas and a PhD in geology and geophysics from UH at Mānoa. So, Scot, thanks for the presentation. Take it away. 
Thanks, Neil. I'm going to share my screen quickly here. And share. Okay. Can everybody see that, my screen, my slides? 
White screen. 
White screen. 
Yeah, not yet, Scot. 
Not yet? Can you see it? 
Nope. White screen. 
Oh, my gosh. Okay. Let me see if I got the right one going here. Try this again. Share screen. I'll try entire screen. How's that? Oh. Okay. Can you see a screen?*(Multiple speakers.)
We see you.
Great. That's progress, okay. 
There we go. Yeah. 
Okay, here we go. Okay. Let me hide this guy. Okay. Well, thank you, Neil, and thank you for inviting me to speak about this study that we've been doing. So I'm gonna talk today about Hawai‘i Volcanic Aquifer Study and give you some highlights of the results. This was a study—one of the studies that the USGS was doing across the nation of the groundwater availability of the principal aquifers in the United States. The final report, the third and final report of this study, was recently published, I think maybe about three or four months ago, and I—most of what I'm gonna talk about comes from this final report, but there are two other reports. The first report is a summary of the hydrogeology of Hawai‘i, and it includes updates all the way up to when it was published was kind of like the mid-2010s or so. It also includes updates on groundwater recharge for Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, and Maui. The second report—let's see. Let me get my pointer out here. Oops. The second report, that one goes down into the weeds about groundwater modeling. So for those who are interested in that, you can look at that, you know, if you're into mod flow and all of the details that go into that. of the information that I'm gonna be talking about, again, is in the final report, and there's also a fact sheet that's available. All of these are available online at these sites, or if you just Google USGS Publications Warehouse and Volcanic Aquifers of Hawaiʻi, you'll get it. Okay. So how to answer the question of how much groundwater is available in  from Hawaiʻi's aquifers? Well, all groundwater withdrawals have consequences. In Hawaiʻi, I am sure many of you are familiar with this, but those consequences are water-table decline, saltwater rise and encroachment  I guess you should see it down here  and reduction of groundwater discharge to springs, streams, wetlands, and the ocean. Groundwater availability depends on the severity of the consequences the community is willing to accept, so groundwater availability depends on what you're able to accept in consequences. And we know that those consequences  you know, it's a complicated question and, you know, involves human and environmental health considerations, economics, legal rights, and statutes, and so forth, which are kind of beyond the science part, but  Okay. The consequences also differ by hydrogeologic setting. Now, in the report, we group the groundwater occurrences in Hawaiʻi to four principal hydrogeologic settings. Again, these are probably very familiar to you, but  freshwater or basal lens setting, there's dike-impounded groundwater, there's thickly saturated aquifers, and then there's perched aquifers. I'll talk about the first three, anyway, subsequently. But there's also enigmatic occurrences, and this includes things like the Schofield Aquifer or Schofield high-level groundwater and some of the things that are being discovered on the Big Island that don't really fit into these principal hydrogeologic settings, and we'll talk about that a little bit. Okay. So the freshwater or basal lens, again, very familiar to you, freshwater floating buoyantly on saltwater in the aquifer. When you take groundwater from that, the consequences of taking groundwater from that is water-table reduction and saltwater rise, and reduction of discharge to the ocean. Where there is cap rock, then the freshwater lens is thicker because the cap rock resists the flow of water to the ocean. The fact is that the freshwater lens gets thicker, but it also causes some of the groundwater discharge to discharge above sea level to springs, such as the Pearl Harbor Springs are a good example. So when you take water from this system, again, you have water table decline and rise of saltwater and encroachment of saltwater, but you also have reduction of discharge to streams that are on land. In the dike-impounded groundwater system, we havelow-permeability dikes, volcanic dikes that have impounded groundwater to hundreds of feet above sea level. And where the erosion has exposed the dikes, then water discharges from these dike compartments feeds streams and supports stream base flow. When you take water from this system, and again you have water table decline and reduction of groundwater discharge to streams and springs and things on the land. There's also reduction of groundwater discharge to the ocean. There is some saltwater encroachment near the coast, but for the most part, this area is not gonna be affected by saltwater intrusion. Okay. And then there's the thickly saturated aquifers. These are aquifers that are not highly permeable, that the entire aquifer is made up out of low-permeability rock. And in particular, the example that I've worked on is the one on Kaua‘i in the Lihue Basin where lava flows—thick lava flows have filled in preexisting depressions and formed these thick low-permeability aquifers. And in this case, the freshwater saturates all the way to the land surface, and much of the—excuse me—much of the groundwater discharge occurs at streams above sea level. So, of course, if you take water from that, one of the biggest impacts is going to be to—would be reduction in streamflow. There is also reduction of groundwater discharge to the ocean. There likely is saltwater encroachment near the coast, but, you know, this Freshwater lens is pretty thick, so how far this might threaten wells further inland, we don't really know. Okay. So the one enigmatic occurrence that I'm gonna talk about today is the Schofield high-level groundwater. It's an area of high-level groundwater that's higher than you would expect from  in a high-permeability aquifer. We know from data, groundwater data that it's not perched; it's saturated all the way down to sea level, and freshwater probably extends quite a bit below sea level. Many hydrologists have postulated some sort of a groundwater barrier, like a dam vertical structure that is supporting this, but the actual structure is not really known. Now, the  probably the main consequence of taking water out of this is reduction of groundwater flow to adjacent aquifers, so, yeah, it will reduce the amount of water available in the adjacent aquifers. Okay. So to quantify the consequences of the groundwater withdrawal for this study, we used groundwater models of Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, and Maui. These islands have most of the  well, these islands have all of the principal hydrologic settings that we talked about before, so at least we can test them. We created calibrated models which had 2001 to 2010 conditions for pumping and recharge and land use, and so forth. So then we took this model, this calibrated model, and Then we did some scenarios looking backwards to see what would happen. When we compare these backwards scenarios—backward-looking scenarios—to the calibrated model, we can see how conditions that exist in 2001 to 2010 have impacted the groundwater resource. We also looked in the future and did some hypothetical scenarios with increased withdrawal and change in rainfall to see how these conditions might affect groundwater resources relative to the calibrated 2001 to 2010 conditions. For the first one, let's look backwards. In this example, we're looking at the past. One of the scenarios that we did was just shut down all the wells that we had in the 2001-2010 simulation. This would be looking back, you know, to pretty much predevelopment conditions. For example, this is just Oahu's, and these colors show the change in groundwater levels, the intensity of change in groundwater levels. You can see that by shutting down all the wells, it caused—well, it caused water levels to—I'm sorry, I've got to go back. I'll rephrase that. Looking at the no-withdrawal scenario and calibrated model, we can see how the 2001 to 2010 conditions impacted the past. Then we can see that the 2001 to 2010 conditions have caused groundwater levels, water levels, to decrease quite a bit in the dike-impounded groundwater areas.and a little bit more here because  but not as much in the Wai‘anae area because withdrawals are not as much as they are in the Ko‘olau side. The freshwater lens, despite having quite a bit of withdrawal in 2001 to 2010, can see that the water table hasn't declined quite as much as it has in the dike-impounded area, but that's because of the high permeability of the freshwater lens setting. But in the freshwater lens setting, the saltwater-freshwater boundary rose considerably under this 2001 to 2010 condition. So it shows that for the freshwater lenses, saltwater rise is one  gonna be one of the principal factors that limit groundwater availability. You know, there is a little bit also going on in the dike-impounded areas, but not as much as you see in the freshwater lens. This map shows the effect of the withdrawals on streamflow, and now, again, we see that most of the impact is happening in the streams in the dike-impounded groundwater areas. In the freshwater lens areas, it  there is an impact right at the  where the cap rock meets the aquifer, and there are  there is groundwater discharge to  to springs in the  in the freshwater lens. This is the Pearl Harbor Springs. Another simulation was to look at the combination of withdrawal and recharge, so we looked at  we simulated recharge in 1870, this was before the first modern well was.drilled, and then we combined it with the no-withdrawal scenario, and then by comparing that to the calibrated model, we could see what the impact of current recharge changes and pumping have. Most of the changes in recharge resulted  between these two periods have resulted in land use  have resulted from land use changes, including agriculture. And I'm gonna show Kaua‘i for this example and this is for water  changes in water levels. The agriculture has caused some areas to  for water levels in some areas to increase, and that's shown by these blue patches, and in some areas it has decreased as shown in the brown areas. The blue areas in particular for Kaua‘i correspond with irrigation reservoirs that are leaking, and they enhance the groundwater recharge, so they're going to reduce the effect of groundwater withdrawals in these areas. In areas where there's a reduction in recharge and lowering of water levels, that's going to exacerbate the effects of groundwater withdrawals. Another simulation was to look at  to the future, and this is to increase withdrawals in the future, and for this, we increased the withdrawals from conventional wells. These are the conventional vertical wells, wells that are drilled vertically, not tunnels. We did not increase the  simulate any increases in tunnel withdrawal, but  so just for the conventional wells. And this is a map of how the Increases looked. The bigger the dot, the bigger the increase. These increases are based on the permitted rates at the water commission, and in most cases, the permitted rates are actually higher than the actual groundwater withdrawal rates. And here's a map showing the water level changes caused by that scenario, and we can see that the big impact was in the Schofield Aquifer. You can see that's because there's a bunch of increases here. Oops. But there are also changes along the central corridor where the groundwater levels were increased. There's some increases in the dike-impounded groundwater areas. These are high-intensity; you can see the color here is kind of dark, so that indicates a high-intensity water level change, but it's not widespread. This is a map of the change in the saltwater-freshwater boundary, and you can see that, again, the big change is in the freshwater lens areas both in the south and in the north. This is a map of the change in streamflow, and the biggest change that's apparent here is at the springs by the cap rock, so the Pearl Harbor Springs and North Shore too. You don't see so much in the dike-impounded groundwater area, but that's probably because the model did not change the withdrawal in the tunnels, and much of the water that's developed in this area is from  from these tunnels. Okay. One thing we could say about the Schofield Aquifer is that this change in future withdrawals has  the model simulation does indicate that the fresh  the groundwater flow from the Schofield Aquifer to adjacent freshwater lenses in the north and in the south is gonna be reduced. It also pulls more water, causes more water to flow in from the dike-impounded groundwater areas. Okay. Now, looking at one more thing, and this is another future assessment, this was a change in rainfall. This was a climate change assessment. And for this, we used the statistical downscaling of RCP8.5 for the  for midcentury. I think you all are familiar with that. But it's a pretty dry scenario. And this indicates that  our model simulations indicate for the water levels that there will be some areas that will have large water level impacts, and in this case, it's Waena, the dry side of Oʻahu. It's  it also has  you can see some color in the impounded areas on  of the Koʻolau and in the Schofield high-level aquifer. This map shows the change in saltwater-freshwater boundary caused by the reduction in rainfall, and we can see that accompanying the change in water levels that we saw in the previous map is saltwater encroachment in the Waiʻanae area. So to summarize, the primary consequences limiting The availability of groundwater differs amongst the hydrologic settings. In the freshwater lens setting, saltwater rise and encroachment, reduction of groundwater discharge to the ocean, and also to springs where there's cap rock, are the principal consequences that are going to limit groundwater availability in that area. For dike-impounded and thickly saturated aquifers, the principal consequences limiting availability include water level decline and reduction of discharge to streams and springs. For upgrading aquifers such as the Schofield Aquifer, Schofield high-level groundwater would be reduction of flow to adjacent aquifers. These consequences depend on the magnitude of the withdrawals and can change with changes in recharge caused by land use or climate. Collaboration between management and science can work towards a balance between groundwater withdrawal and the need to limit the consequences. This study demonstrated how groundwater modeling can help quantify the consequences of groundwater withdrawal for a certain set of situations. If water managers have a certain set of limits that they don’t want to overstep, science can run scenarios to figure out what the available groundwater is under those limitations or, alternatively, if...stakeholders have estimates of how much water they would like to have, models could be run to quantify what the consequences of that  taking that water would be. And that is all I have. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Scot. Commissioners, questions for Scot Izuka?
I'll be first.
Aurora, your hand is up.
Yeah. Thank you for the presentation. It's good to see it a second time. I was wondering, Ryan Imata presented information on the deep monitoring wells last meeting, and the magnitude, I guess, of the changes of the transition zone seem pretty complex for  I think it was Pearl Harbor Aquifer. Ryan, are you there? And then looking at your, I think it was 2000 to 2010 model for O‘ahu, it looked like  I think it was the saltwater-freshwater boundary picture in the blue.
Yeah. Do you want  should I share my screen again?
Yeah, would you share that?
Okay. Sorry, then I won't be able to see everybody, but oh, well.
It looked like it had some really large changes on the order of feet  and I was justg if you could  it's a model and Ryan's data and have there been kind of efforts to take and caliber  calibrate the model with the deep water (inaudible). 
Since  since the  no, the  
Okay. 
There hasn't been any  well, the model was calibrated to the 2001 to 2010 conditions, and I admit that's, you know, a decade  more than a decade old already. 
Yeah. 
But that's  
I think it was the O‘ahu saltwater-freshwater boundary second  first (inaudible). 
This one, yeah? 
Yeah. 
Effect of the 2010 withdrawal on  so this is relative to, yeah, shutting them all off. 
Oh, to shutting them off. 
Yeah, yeah. Okay, so  so the way we did it is we took the calibrated model, which had all of those wells operating  
Oh. 
and pumping, and then to see what would happen if they did not exist, we shut them all down, and then we did the comparison. So this is the result of having those wells pumping.
Okay.
Okay, yeah. It's a backwards 
So this is a  kind of an imagined scenario of if we  if we stopped pumping, is that 
Right. And the reality was that the wells went in, you know, over time, right?
Okay.
They didn't just all happen.
Okay. Okay, so when Ryan said the transition zone has been stable from  you know, over the last, I don't know, 20 years or so or period of record, we  they aren't really comparable to this image, I guess. That's all I'm saying. I'm just trying to clear my thinking was like they were used  that data was used to build the model, but that data and this image do not line up, and I shouldn't compare them, right?
Well, there  yeah. There are things that are gonna make the model  you know, it's a model, but it's gonna make it difficult  well, there are gonna be challenges for matching actual data, but that doesn't mean it's  you know, that you should throw out one or the other. But one of the things is that this is a steady-statemodel, so there is  this is what will happen ultimately if the 2001 to 2010 conditions were kept steady forever. It  there's no time dimension on this simulation. So I couldn't say that this would happen in a hundred years or ten years or 20 years or something like that.
Okay.
And  yeah. And the other thing is that that  that also means that the wells didn't go in a  in the way that they actually did, you know, over time. Oh, the other thing that I wanted to say is so the change in the freshwater-saltwater interface is going to increase  it's going to  the change is gonna happen quickly at the beginning and slow down as you approach the  you know, the steady state. The  it may be very difficult to see changes as the  as these freshwater  as this  as the system settles into a new steady state. And the third thing is that, most likely, the aquifer is not at its steady state because new wells are being put in all the time, right?
Okay. Larry, your hand is up. Go ahead.
Yeah. How does this affect current estimates of sustainable yield, and what's the timeframe in which we'd have to change them?
Well, I guess my  my take on thsustainable yield issue is that for this  the things that  the consequences that limit the availability of water from any particular aquifer is going to be different because  depend on its hydrologic system. So, in this case  let me get the pointer out so that  so in the freshwater lenses, things like water table or the saltwater-freshwater interface or the depth of the transition zone will be very important. But, you know, when you look at things like dike-impounded groundwater and, you know, in  on O‘ahu or Kaua‘i, or the thickly saturated aquifers, it's probably going to be streamflow because at some point, you know, as the managers of Hawai‘i's groundwater, someone will probably ask you, Well, can you limit the amount of streamflow reduction in  you know, in my area? And that's going to become the limiting factor. It's not gonna be saltwater rise anymore. So then, you'll have to assess the availability of groundwater for dike-impounded areas based on that criterion. So also  already changes, I think  
But that's not really my question. My question is that  
Okay. 
I see that sometime in the future, even though there's resistance to it, is that you're gonna have to move water around. Like, for example, on the island of O‘ahu, you can't go by aquifer-specific use like Now, for example, I know there's resistance on the Windward side to be able to transfer water to the Leeward side if they start getting short. So I'm more interested in not aquifer-specific water, but how would that affect the availability of water across the whole island? And in the practical consequence of your research, is it not gonna make any difference or do we have to worry about that in the future?
I think the approach to assessing groundwater availability has to take into account these consequences. I guess I'm not understanding the question 'cause I thought that's what you were asking.
Well, let me simplify my question. How is your research gonna impact what we consider available sustainable yield? Is it not gonna have any consequence? Or if not, what is the purpose of your research?
Oh, okay. So what I have shown, the research has shown that as managers, you're trying to determine the amount of water availability for human use, but there are also other uses that you are trying to balance them with, right? So in order to get to that answer, you have to consider things that are appropriate for those situations. For those settings, for the dike-impounded groundwater or freshwater lens, it's gonna be a different  different set of limiting circumstances. So the study that I have done, the study that we've done, it's a group of people, demonstrated that we can use things like groundwater modeling, we can also have other kinds of studies that can assess, that can quantify the impacts of groundwater  of groundwater withdrawal and that will then, in turn, help you determine what the groundwater availability is. So it's a  it's kind of a question, a chicken-and-egg question. To know how much groundwater is available, we first  the scientists need to know first how much change are you willing to accept? How much of a consequence are you willing to accept?
Okay. I guess I'm not getting through to you. What I want to know is that based on what you've been presenting, are we gonna have to change the sustainable yield of the aquifers, like, for example, on O‘ahu?
I think you will have to change the method.
And then my secondary question on that was, what was the timeframe of that change?
As  okay, that is  I guess that's  would be a groundwater management problem.
Yeah. You know, because, for if we have the Pearl Harbor Aquifer at X amount of million gallons, as we take it down  if we take it down further down, I assume that you're gonna already have to change the sustainable yield as you get closer to the maximum because you're having saltwater uprisings, etc., or decreased streamflow or no more watercress forming in Pearl City. So that was my question, is that what would you estimate the timeframe in which we start to have to consider reducing sustainable yields?
Okay. That isn't  again, the model is not capable of  it's a steady-state model, so it doesn't have a time element in it, so it won't tell you how much longer you have. Models can be done  can be created to do that, but these models were not and takes a lot more data than we had.
But if  but if one of your  one of your scenarios was increased withdrawals.
Right.
So it seems to me that if that's one of your models and you could come up with an estimate, that would be a direct relationship to how much of a sustainable yield has to change, correct?
It  yeah. Well, it would  it would tell you what the result  it would tell you what the result of changing the pumping rate is, but it doesn't tell youwhether it's sustainable because it depends on how much the water managers, and I'm thinking that's you, that's the water commission, how much of the consequence of doing that you are willing to accept. Because we saw that by doing those scenarios, we saw that it caused the freshwater lens to get thinner, it caused some streams to go  to have less stream discharge, some springs to have lower discharge. So is that an acceptable  without the answer to what's acceptable, it's virtually impossible for the scientists to tell you how much is available.
So you're saying, then, that we decide sustainable yield when we start seeing negative effects? Because, you know, when I was on the water commission, we had sort of crude models for figuring out what sustainable yield or  was it Mink and  I can't remember.(Inaudible comments.)
So are we still  if we're still dependent on that and the only way that we would change the sustainable yield is if we start seeing  we're topping off and we're gonna start seeing negative effects like we did on the ‘Iao Aquifer on Maui a couple of decades ago. So  oh, okay.
I'm going to (inaudible) th 
Okay.
too, Commissioner Miike. I think, you know, this is one dataset we use as staff to come up with recommendations on any adjustments to sustainable yield and the timeframe for that. There is another study that's being  hopefully gonna get published by the end of this year, which is the impact of climate change on recharge. So there's the recharge values, there's this  the hydrology evaluation, these different hydrologic conditions, and scenarios that we have to consider. And as you mentioned, the sustainable yield and the RAM model is  crude, right? It has a lot of assumptions built into it. And so part of our challenge, I think, working with Ryan and his groundwater team, working with Ayron and Dean with surface water, is to look at this more comprehensively. Maybe just to  for clarification, Scot, you know, in your maximum pump scenarios, which looks at future increases, is that based on pump capacity, or was that based on water use permit allocations because we're in a groundwater management area?
Yeah, it was on permit allocations.
Permit allocations, okay.
Yeah, yeah. I got it from (inaudible).
So just getting to your  towardmanagement on Oʻahu, because we're a groundwater management area except for Waiʻanae currently. Another management tool is the ability to shift allocations, reduce allocations where we may see potential impacts based on these additional studies or that could be a recommendation that we as staff look at based on this new data. So we had set a sustainable yield, we allocated based on that sustainable yield, but with this additional data and information, we may need to revisit those allocations if those impacts to springs, shorelines discharge, or other types of protected public trust uses are impacted. We might need to re-evaluate that, so (inaudible). 
So we wouldn't so much change the sustainable yield, but, rather, we would change allocations? 
There could be both. It could be multipronged. I think a lot of the data that  and partnerships we've had with USGS on a lot of this research  and, you know, UH is jumping on board with Water Resource Research Center's work. We can come at it both ways. I think the commission has adopted historically a very conservative approach to sustainable yield and always picked the bottom of these ranges. The commission could open that box up, right, and look at where there's a high demand and there's this range, and if we're not seeing impact, do we want to create a range of sustainable yield and adjust it that way? Again, we  it is a management tool that I think can be revisited and looked at in a way  you know, region or hydrologic unit by hydrologic unit, it could be moku by moku, it could be island by island. Like you're suggesting, if we're needing to shift water resources around Oʻahu  we're having a presentation by Board of Water Supply right after this on East Honolulu Watershed Management Plan, so I'm curious to see how maybe builds off of some of these conversations about how water is utilized on this island considering the built physical environment of this  you know, the board's infrastructure. I think it  it should be both strategies, but that's something that we'd have to bring up and recommend to you folks. As our policy setters, what do you want to see pursued moving forward?
Okay.
Any other questions? I have one, Scot. On your summary, you talked about major changes, and you included climate change; what  in your mind, what is that? Is that the sea level rise and greater salinity? I mean, what were you thinking of? Because with the accelerated climate change, does this modeling get impacted by that?
The thing that we looked at in the modelas far as climate change was the change in precipitation.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, not sea level rise.
I see.
But that is a consideration. I think there are other people researching that.
Okay, all right. Thank you. Aurora.
Thanks for this. I just was wondering, is there a way that we can dynamically explore scenarios for planning, or does it have to be run—do we have to—does the commission staff need to give you the parameters? Do you have to run it and give it back, or will there be a future way where we can say play plan or play God a little bit and say if this happens, what happens in Ko‘olau? If we change this dial, what happens to these different response variables?
You know, that is a really good question because that is something that the USGS and, you know, else—throughout the USGS, nationwide, is kind of thought about because for us—you know, as you say, if you—the water commission came up with this scenario and you wanted us to test it, then we'd run the model and then we'd write a report and then, you know, so many years later you get the report
Right.
Kind of a  Yeah, and we understand that. So one of the things that has been explored  excuse me. Unfortunately, I don't know what the current status of it is, but was somehow getting the ability of the users, that includes the public, to run certain things on groundwater models because that's really what I think the value of the groundwater model would be. So you could say, Okay, I'm gonna put wells in here and here and here, put it on Nyx, say, and I think they have explored things like web-based  you know, a web-based tool that does that. And then, because groundwater models take a while to run  and that's gonna change because things are gonna get faster and faster and faster. But anyway, because groundwater models take a while to run back then when they were trying these things, they would have the  my understanding is that they would have the results ready for you at a certain time, and then they would send you a text and say, Okay, here's your results. So, you know, maybe it might take a couple days for the groundwater model to run that scenario. But anyway, scenario testing should, I think  I would  just looking into the future, it's probably  and it might not happen in my career, but I would think that that would be something that could be done.ady explored doing it. And sorry, did that answer your question?  
Well, it's discouraging to hear that it might not be during your career, and maybe there's ways to make that happen sooner. Unless you're planning to retire soon. 
Maybe that's  maybe that was a hint that I was gonna  no, but anyways, yeah. (Laughter.) It's  you know, it's possible for that to happen. 
Yeah. 
I think the technology's already there. There needs to be a customer for it, and I think, you know, there is, and then someone to provide that product, and I think the USGS could do that. 
Thank you. 
Any other questions? (No response.) Is there anybody in the room that wants to make a comment on this? (No response.)  
Anybody on Zoom? Kathy, is there anybody  Abbey and Franz are here for  is it B
