So you've done it really well and set a model and an example for all of us.

As you come here, you don't know a lot, but yet you're very respectful of everybody else, a good team member. And as Wayne has said, you recognize that these decisions have to balance a lot of interests. You have -- you have some, others have other perspectives, and I've always felt this great sense of respect for your peers and for the testifiers and the diverse constituencies out there that need to be served. I appreciate that.

And finally, you made a special effort to be transparent, and your -- you kept those humongous decisions, you know, East Maui and Nā Wai ʻEhā and so forth, you know, you were the one who fought for executive summaries. So the public really needs to not get mired in all the details or just the one line item that affects them and so forth; they need to see the big picture, and I think it really helps people. It creates the common ground, the higher -- the higher sense of vision and value that helps bring people together. So it's -- it's considerate of them to -- they should -- they need to know, but it's also unifying for those that can share this, and I think that's helped us a lot.

So I hope part of your future is not just building a wonderful school, but also maybe playing a little music.

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Oh, yeah, yeah.
