Approval of Stream Channel Alteration Permit (SCAP.6039.2) Application and Special Conditions, Hawaiʻi Department of Land and Natural Resources, Lihue- Koloa Forest Reserve Queensland Crossing, Wailua Stream, Kauaʻi, Tax Map Key(s): (4) 3-9-001:004; 3-9-002:001; and 4-2-001:002
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Deputy Director Dean Uyeno & Sheri Mann
Staff stated the summary request which is to approve SCAP.6039.2.
Why do you need to replace it and just not remove it?
I can call up Dr. Strauch to speak to the difficulties in having to cross that. Whenever there are high flows the basketball-sized boulders that are within the stream channel tend to get moved and when you’re trying to cross the stream at times it is...
Wasn’t that an old cane haul crossing historically? 
Yeah, it was in the submittal. I believe it was 70 or 90 years old.
So again, is there a need to access at that point?
Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Branch. I won’t speak on behalf of DOFAW, but I do know that state employees, both DOFAW and CWRM if not other state employees utilize the lands mauka of this crossing. This is an important access point to forest reserve and game management area lands. CWRM has two monitoring stations above this crossing. The original crossing was passable under most non-flooding conditions, but currently it takes a lot of maintenance, to maintain any sort of crossing some sort of excavator has to move around the boulders after high flow events.
Well aware of that.
Not just state employees but the public likes to access the forest and the streams mauka of this location.
There is a utility value? 
Maybe Sheri can speak to that as well, from DOFAW.
If you could share with us what the crossing is used for and by whom?
Sure, aloha Chair, Commission. My name is Sheri Mann, I’m the branch manager for the Division of Forestry and Wildlife for Kauaʻi island. This forest reserve has many uses by the public, it’s also the primary access road to Blue Hole which is towards the end of the road and a very unique geologic formation on Kauaʻi island. It’s also the location where the North and South Fork streams start and divert and so there’s a lot of uses of those streams. As Ayron said there are some devices up there to be checking instream flows. It’s also a major hunting area and we have people up there every day of the week hunting and it’s used a lot by cultural practitioners. It’s heavily used in terms of forest reserves on Kauaʻi island. It’s also the primary route to get up to do research and all kinds of management activities that are critical for us to maintain, so we slowed down the encroachment of invasive landscape-altering plants that we don’t want to go up into the upper mauka watershed that’s highly protected.
Sheri, it’s a vehicular access, right?
Yes, the Queensland Crossing is actually a cement ford and over time the ford has been deteriorated and then the floods of 2018, it was pretty much wiped out. We’ve done our best to try and patch it and fix it over time, but it’s just been altered significantly at which time we approached Rep. Tokioka for a CIP for more of a long-term repair. These are the funds that are going into that kind of work and this permit is needed to put that work into action. It’s a $2 million CIP.
The permittee is DOFAW?
I’m not sure if it’s under engineering or under us.
Well, it’s actually DLNR, it’s not the county.
Engineering division.
So DLNR. There’s always an issue about who should be maintaining streams and whether that’s the state or the county. I guess we won’t address that here.
State lands, in this case it’s the state.
This is for staff and it pertains to traditional and customary practices. While the applicant kind of reviewed the site history, are there downstream users who could potentially be affected by the construction and repair of this? Specifically, when we discussed Mahi Pono’s modifications we talked about downstream users and just notification of when construction is happening. If there are downstream users that may notice changes in flow or quality, that we consider that in this application?
At this point in the stream if you’re speaking specifically to aquatic species I believe there is a lot of largemouth bass in this section of the stream so our concern for native species isn’t as, not to says it’s not of concern in this area, but we temper that there is a considerable amount of invasive species such as bass and trout in this section the stream.
The quantity of water won’t change in the stream and obviously best management practices regarding water quality will be practiced.
Specifically speaking to traditional and customary practices, are there any kalo farmers down gradient? I don’t know this area well so that wasn’t...
There shouldn’t be any impacts to the flows in the stream while construction is going on.
Even during construction, you won’t have to stop the flows to put in this?
They’re just building a small coffer dam for half the stream at a time.
We will be closing the Loop Road during construction so that won’t allow the public to traverse to this point or beyond it. There are other ways to get beyond this point but they’re from either other landowners or they would have to go through forest non-accessible lands. There will be a temporary change to general access for all users, but it’ll just be during the construction phase of the project and it’s basically repairing the ford that was already there so the water flows over it. The way we’ve been mitigating it is building the rocks back up so users can cross but this should allow smooth, traversable access with a four-wheel drive. Ayron would know better but I don’t see this changing the water flow. That really has been a natural occurrence when floods come, it comes raging down but otherwise it’s fairly consistent.
Following up on Aurora’s comment about hunters, are we notifying hunters that this access may be closed temporarily so that they’ll have to find alternate access?
Yes, we have had to close it several times over the last several years due to the impassibility of it. They’re fairly aware and used to us closing but certainly once we get close to construction time, we’ll put out press releases and consult with the GMAC and make sure that all the stakeholders are aware of this. I think they’re supportive of it because right now they either can’t pass, or they take a chance passing which is not anything we want. We’ve had vehicles get stuck and roll into the river and we just want to avoid that. They are aware and we will certainly reiterate that.
It’s probably better that we improve it for water quality and everything else. They’re probably driving all over the place.
MOTION: (KATAYAMA / KAGAWA-VIVIANI) To approve staff recommendation as submitted.
