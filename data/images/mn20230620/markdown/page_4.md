For all meeting participants, I would like to stress the importance of speaking slowly.

I am now going to read the contested case statement for the record if I can find it. Yikes.

DEPUTY MANUEL: It should be at the back of the agenda.

CHAIR CHANG: Back of the agenda. Aha, I found it.

In some of the matters before the commission, a person may wish to request a contested case hearing. If such a request is made before the commission's decision, then the commission will consider the request first before considering the merits of the item before it. A person who wants a contested case may also wait until the commission decides the issue, then request a contested case after the decision. It is up to you. Any request made -- must be made orally by the end of the meeting and followed up by written writing within ten days. If no request for a contested case is made, the commission will make a decision. The department will treat the decision as final and proceed accordingly.

All right. I am now going to take roll call of the commissioners. I will go first in -- those that are present in the room.

I'll start first with Wayne.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Wayne Katayama.
