The next item on the agenda is Item No. B1, it is the Navy  Navy Region and Navy Facilities Overviews/Updates of Red Hill Remediation and Closure, Redft Recovery and Monitoring, and Monitoring Well Development and Water Data. I think General Hashimoto, you are at the table. Again, thank you very much. This is the second update to the water commission. We have greatly appreciated the Navy appearance before the commission intended to provide us some good information about the current status of your  the cleanup at Red Hill. So go ahead, General Hashimoto, and if you could also introduce your staff.
Aloha, Chair Chang, Deputy Chair Manuel, Commissioners, Ladies and Gentlemen. My name is Major General Mark Hashimoto, and I represent the United States Indo-Pacific Command. And mahalo for this opportunity to provide updates on matters that are directly related to the water itself and that are also forward-looking. We are going to provide updates on Red Hill site remediation and closure, shaft recovery and monitoring, and monitoring well development, as well as water data. As Chair Chang mentioned, the last time we were here was the meeting on March 21st. During that meeting, we had a few follow-ups to  besides providing a general update periodically, and those had to do with soil vapor extraction, as well as GAC flow optimization, so those will be covered as well as a general update as part of today's brief. What I'd like to start with before we get into the specifics of the agenda item is I'd like to have the JoinTask Force-Red Hill provide an update on the defueling operations. And we'll start with Lieutenant Colonel Wingear. 
Good morning. My name is Lieutenant Colonel Casey Wingear. I am the new chief of staff for the Joint Task Force-Red Hill. I replaced Colonel Kevin Williams, who briefed you last time in March. Although new to the position, I am not new to the joint task force. I joined the joint task force when it was stood up in September, and I've been serving as Admiral Wade's executive assistant and a planner on the team. Thank you for the opportunity to provide an update. It's truly an honor. As you know, the mission is for the joint task force to safely and expeditiously defuel the Red Hill facility and to rebuild the trust with the people of Hawai‘i. When we assumed this mission, Admiral Wade was committed to building a plan to iterate and increase our understanding of that plan, to learn, and in partnership with the regulators, find ways to speed up the process to start and finish defueling Red Hill. Next slide, please. As you may remember, this is our Integrated Master Schedule, and I want to draw your attention to the yellow box on the top (inaudible) when we updated you last time. The (inaudible) we are on plan to commence gravity defueling starting in August  October of 2023 with a completion date of January of 2024. This is five months earlier than briefed.- time. This process will remove 104 million gallons or approximately 99 percent of the fuel in the facility. We realize that there still remains a substantial amount of fuel, approximately 100,000 gallons when we complete this phase, and to  and we are  to be clear, we will remove every last drop of fuel from the facility. We are currently in planning to determine how best to safely and expeditiously remove that residual fuel and we will add additional supplements to complete that plan that will address all actions to remove that fuel. I want to draw your attention to the Plans line, a couple of key points along this one. First in May, Defuel Supplement 2 that was submitted by  or was released by the Department of Defense on May 16th, and that plan outlines how we are going to execute defueling operations on this accelerated timeline. Since that release, it has since been approved by the Department of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency. Moving a little bit further to the right, in July, you'll see a decision point for tankers for the October start date. We did, in fact, meet all conditions for that decision point, and Admiral Wade informed the Secretary of Defense and also the Defense Logistic Agencies to move forward with the contracting actions to have tankers online for this accelerated start date. Moving down to the Response line, down in July, you'll see a fueling spill; that was our final interagency exercise that we just completed on the 13th of this month, and we are currently training our roving security and fire watch teams to complete a culminating capstone event to move a couple diamonds to the right for the fire watch capstone event in August, to be conducted on the 16th and 17th. Moving down to the bottom on the NEPA line, since our last update, we completed the 30-day public comment period in June, and we are on track to complete the NEPA process by the end of August. Moving up one to the Ops line, we completed the dewatering process, which, as you may remember, removes water from the tanks and the pipelines to prevent corrosion and to ensure the quality of the fuel. A little bit to the right there, we did complete tank tightness testing, which ensures the integrity of the tanks. And a little bit further to the right there in July, we are currently in the process of draining the surge tanks. We should be complete sometime next week. This process will remove 480,000 gallons of fuel from the facility. Each of these evolutions are meticulously planned, trained to, rehearsed, response drills are exercised, and they are all each approved by the regulators before execution. are currently in the process of that same methodology for the next one, as you can see if you go down from the August timeframe, fuel repacking. Repacking will be conducted at the end of August, and it will be the first time that we reintroduce fuel into the pipelines starting from the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam side up to the Red Hill facility since we actually unpacked the lines, as you may remember, back in October-November of last year. And last on this slide, moving up to the Repair and Maintenance, you'll see in June, the DOD repairs need to be complete; in July, the third-party quality validation items need to be complete; and then in August, repair approval received which comes from the Department of Health. Next slide, please. This is our 
Chair Chang. Chair Chang, may I?
Yes, please go ahead. Is that Neil?
Before you leave  before you leave the slide, Lieutenant Colonel Wingeart, thank you for using the dashboard and keeping the goalposts in place so we can see our progress toward the end line. I have two questions. What about that 6 percent of the fuel you can't defuel immediately makes it problematic? Why is that a problem?
It's not necessarily a problem in terms of it just randomly leaking out; it just takes a long time to remove because it's stuck in pipelines at bends or low points, and it takes a different process than gravity to remove it.
I see. Thank you. And with your  respect to your NEPA public comment, can you give a high-level summary of what the comments of the public were and what your responses were?
There were, I want to say, approximately 20 comments, of which, if I remember right, I think six were substantial, and that process for reviewing those comments and addressing each of those concerns is ongoing.
So what was the nature of the six that were 
I'd have to come back to you with the  those specifics.
Chair.
Yes, I see Aurora.
Yeah. While we're also still on this slide, what  and I don't know if this is in your purview, but what kind of monitoring and surveillance is there to, say, quite quickly identify potential spills, you know, with repacking and defueling? Is that (inaudible)  
Yeah, I can start.  
Okay.  
So the roving security and fire watch team that I mentioned that we're currently training, that team will be a 68-person element that will be in the facility 24/7 roaming.  
Uh-huh.  
So moving up and down the pipelines so that we can identify, if there is a problem, quickly, and then take action as required.  
When you refer to facility, do you mean just around the tanks, or does that facility include all of the pipelines all the way down to the piers?  
It includes the pipelines.  
And those are   
And if I could add, in addition to that, we are continuing with the groundwater monitoring that is occurring as well as the soil vapor monitoring that is occurring within the vicinity of the tank gallery.  
Yeah. So my understanding is that is, again, around the tanks, but there's potential for   
Correct. So it   
So it's human   
has expanded. The original were all within the tank gallery, but it has expanded.  
Okay.  
(Inaudible.)  
Okay.  
One other aspect, ma'am, if you may remember, we  we have increased our video monitoring system as well. We've supplemented what was in the facility with some new purchases so that we can monitor  supplement our roving security watch with a little bit more camera ability.  
If I can also turn to DOH, and is DOH working, and on which side?  
DOH is working along with EPA, and they are training their  they go through the same  the exercises with EPA and DOH along with the Navy (inaudible).  
Thank you.  
I have a  I have a question. You said a 68-team roving  a 68-person roving team.  
Roving security and fire watch, yes, ma'am.  
Is that per shift, or is that in total?  
That's in total.  ll be broken down into multiple teams. Each of them will have a lead who is a subject matter expert in that field, and then each of them are going through our training process right now. 
And they're gonna be responsible for different sectors of the  
When the team is on, each person will be identified into a certain section, yes. And then, obviously, when the new team comes on, they will cover the same areas. 
Thank you. I know that  while we're at it, I'm assuming that means, like, 24-hour coverage. 
Yes, ma'am. 
And  oh, okay. 
Any other questions from the commissioners before we move on from this slide? (No response.) 
All right, thank you. Go ahead. 
This is our defueling dashboard. We update this every other week, and it's posted to our website and to our apps. I want to draw your attention to the center of the slide, where you see the four gauges. This is how you can track our progress to maintain our We are on track for the early-mid-October start date. On the far left, working left to right, you'll see that we have completed all 253 mandatory repairs as planned. We are complete with 246 through the third-party quality validation program. All 46 of those packets have been submitted to the Department of Health for their review and approval. Finally, on the far right, you'll see that the Department of Health has conditionally approved 178 of those packets we've submitted to them. We feel like we're in a good place between us and the regulators, and we are on glide path to maintain an early start date of October 2023. The last highlight on this slide is in the bottom right, where you'll see two QR codes. These are to our apps to help you download them so you can receive information and track our progress as we defuel the facility. In summary, we still have a lot of work to do, but we are on plan to start defueling early on a mid-October start date. I want to thank you for the time to provide this update, pending any questions you have. Thank you.
Does anybody have any questions? Can I just ask, actually, Kathy Ho, this is a question I have for you, what's DOH's capacity to review all of these documents and materials that are being..submitted to you for review?
We have a small but dedicated team, and we are on track for an August dead  I think it's August 6th deadline to have reviewed and  all of the packets that have been submitted to us.
Thank you. That's (inaudible).
To check just with regard to the NEPA comments and your response, since I don't know when you're coming before the commission again, can you get that  work with our staff to get that to them, and they can get that information to us?
Of course, we'll do so.
Any other comment, Commissioners? Questions?(No response.)
I don't see any hands.  Okay, General Hashimoto, is there any other updates?
Yes, we do. I'd like to 
Okay.
pass it on to Don here. He can introduce himself and talk about tank closure plan timelines and status.
Okay. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for  appreciate the invite down here today. I'Donald Hampton. I work for Navy region of Hawai‘i, overseeing the tank closure plan for Navy Region of Hawai‘i. The slide you're seeing right now is a brief synopsis of all of the products we have submitted along the timeline that we have submitted them. We are making progress going forward. We're working with regulators through ongoing meetings, responding to the requests for additional information so we can provide amplifying information to make informed decisions. We're on a good glide path right now, and we are moving the tank closure plan forward. As you're aware, we're still in the planning phase of the tank closure plan, and it's scheduled to start once defueling is completed with this last spec of it.
If you can highlight Supplement 2.
Yes.
That's something new.
And Supplement 2 is the one released since last time this group met and that provided amplifying information on closure in place, which is a recommendation for the tanks, and envisions a structural analysis report, and we responded to EPA's RFIs on the tank closure plan. All of this information which you'll see on the next slide is in the  I'll pause here. Any questions on this
I don't see any hands. Go ahead, Donald, the next slide.  
The next slide, please. This is just a (inaudible) on this (inaudible) changes in the graphic. The tank closure plan is broken down into four phases. Phase 1 and Phase 2 are in progress right now, which is the planning effort. Phase 3 and Phase 4 will commence once defueling is completed, and that's the physical aspect of the tank disclosure plan.   I'd also like to note right down here, on the bottom middle right there is also a QR code. All that information on the tank closure plan, also anything related to Red Hill and other websites, will be in the QR code. All this information that we're showing here today of all the plans, the supplementals, requests for information, our responses to the requests for information are all posted on the public-facing website via that QR code.  
Commissioners, any questions on this slide?  
Oh, it's on the next slide.  -
Commissioner Viviani.  
Sorry, I think my question is addressed on the next slide, so   
Next slide, please. Okay. This is Phase 2 of the tank closure plan that may be contracted out for public outreach on beneficial nonfuel reuse. Basically, what we need to do in Phase 2 is to identify, evaluate, and discuss options with a public outreach program for the state of Hawai‘i. Nakupuna is doing this effort for us. It is broken down into three phases. Initially, there was an open survey requesting any feedback at all of any recommendations anybody might have. The second part of this was one-on-one interviews with key stakeholders across O‘ahu, which has been completed. And the third phase, which will be going out at the end of this month, is a mail survey to particular area codes  zip codes here within O‘ahu.  All of this information will be comprised into a final report; that final report will be publicly posted and released via our website. The public final report will also be briefed at the fall FTAC this year.  
(Inaudible.) 
Yes, ma'am.  
So how did you  oh,
No, no, no. Go ahead, Vivian. Go ahead.
Can you describe how you identified the key stakeholders?
The key stakeholders were brought in from all  many aspects of  a lot of them were recommendations going from people that have had a lot of involvement with Red Hill overall. Some people that have been more outspoken with Red Hill, depending on any aspect of a reason why, people have sent in RFIs to us just with generic questions that we responded to; since they were interested in Red Hill, we actually reached out to them too. 
Okay. So these are organizations? 
Organizations or individuals. The key stakeholders are organizations, help me's, or just private citizens. 
Including groups that were highly critical of  
Sierra Club was included in that, ma'am, and also Board of Water Supply. 
Okay. 
Any other  oh, yes, Neil. Go ahead. 
What criteria have you...o be employed to make the decision as to repurposing   
Okay.  
of the fuel   
So I'll expand upon this a little bit. The tasking for us in the tank closure plan was to go out and identify, evaluate, and discuss options. Okay? Taking this forward, honestly, there are three independent efforts going on in reference to beneficial reuse. There's the NDA effort looking at DOD reuse.  
National Defense Authorization.  
Yeah, which was being led  which is independent of this one, this effort here. And also, the Office of Naval Research gave a grant to the University of Hawai‘i to look at nonfossil fuel possible reuse. All these three independent efforts are gonna be consolidated into a final report in the latter part of this year, and there will be a brief to Congress in February of 2024. Coming out of Congress, those next steps, I don't have all of those next steps at this time, but I know, finally, it will be an engagement between the Department of Defense and the State of Hawai‘i of what the options  future options could be.  
But there must be some criteria for analysis 
cost, time, safety, public  so can you  can you elucidate, yes.
So when we get all the options in, I'll say there's gonna be a handful that have merit, and the ones that are decided  deemed to have merit are going to go through a feasibility analysis. Because they have merit doesn't mean they're environmentally approved or utility point of approval or structural, so we're gonna have to do a final feasibility analysis, and that feasibility analysis will narrow down the list of options that are feasible  have merit, and that are feasible to implement.
You're giving me process, but I'm not hearing the substance of the criteria. Like such as the 
Cost, time, feasibility, and sustainability.
So what  so sustainability, what does sustainability mean?
That it can  it's something that can be sustained politically, environmentally, financially in the long term.
And do you think that's reflective  those criteria are reflective of the concerns of the public that you're getting from Nakupuna or any otherpublic input process?
Yes. A lot of the feedback we've gotten, sir, is something that would support  benefit the State of Hawai‘i that could be from a usage point of view, an economic point of view. It has to be  also, the feedback, it has to be a hundred percent environmental compliance and protect the environment. So those, I'll say, themes are coming back.
Yeah, I think that's what we're interested in here.
Yes, sir.
I think over time, it's a really good question because what we're talking about is one of the criteria, as you bring up, and then, as with any sort of decision of this magnitude, it's the weighting of each criteria.
Correct.
And so I think this  this effort to get as much input as possible would get, I think, at what you're talking about because while many of these  these are all important decision-making criteria, there are some, I think, that would be reflective of, you know, what the public would expect. And so, again, we're just in the data-collection phase, and as you know, we move into later decision-making, I think absolutely, you know, these kinds of...
If it's, as Lieutenant Wingeart  Lieutenant Colonel Wingeart said, you want to rebuild trust, I think that there needs to be some transparency about that 
Absolutely.
because the fear of somebody who doesn't trust assumes that maybe it's not their interest that's being  that's prioritized, it's money 
Right, right.
or it's something else. So if you lay those cards out on the table and we talk about the prioritization, I think it's  it's more transparent, and there will be a balance, obviously, and I think that's 
I think that's (inaudible).
And it'll all be for all to see.
It's a balance, you know. As I think we could appreciate, it's not  probably won't be formulaic, you know, if you will, but yeah. Thank you.
General Hashimoto, can I ask you who will ultimately make the decision on the reuse?
Go ahead.
Ma'am, this is Donald Hampton. I would say the ultimate decision will be between the Departmentof Defense engaging with the State of Hawai‘i.
Engaging with the State of Hawai‘i.
The State of Hawai‘i. There will be some very senior meetings going back and forth of this  the ones that had merit and that are feasibly capable, and there will be some discussions between the Department of Defense and the State of Hawai‘i to pursue an ultimate solution and recommendation. 
Is the State of Hawai‘i the governor? Is that  who is the State of Hawai‘i? 
Under  under ordinary circumstances, when we're dealing with an underground storage tank, it would be the Department of Health. Obviously, the Department of Health would reach out to other agencies within the State of Hawai‘i and have discussions with members of the public as well. 
Next question. 
I have two questions. Maybe for you, first, following the  and then for Mr. Hampton. So given that  would the process for public input, then, be through FTAC because DOH, you know, doesn't have, like C1, a regular open process? For helping make that kind of follow-up decision. Or is there gonna be another (inaudible)? 
It probably  you know, we 202I haven't really thought that through yet  
Okay, okay. 
because we still have to see what is the outcome, but we will be seeking some public input either through FTAC or some other reaching out. 
I concur with Kathy; you know, we have quarterly meetings to be transparent with the public, two a year with FTAC, two a year with the Navy working with the regulators on the public meetings, and as we progress forward, that would be a great topic. 
Yeah. In addition, the  there was a settlement, a consent order with the federal government, EPA, and the  the Navy and others, and there  on Thursday, they are going to be convening a  their first meeting of   This is a community outreach (inaudible). 
Community outreach and involvement, right. So that's also a good forum to talk about the reuse of the tanks.
I have a question for  
Yes, Larry. 
for the Department of Health. When you say you're gonna be the decision-maker, you really mean the governor, right? The governor or the legislature? You know, this is a political issue. I mean, I..know you're the technical agency, but when you say that, you're not the ultimate decision. 
I would say we would have discussions with everyone about the  
But I  but I'm asking who makes the final decision. It's not DOH, right? 
Well, ultimate  
I used to be in DOH, so I  
I understand. I used to work for you when I was a DA, and you were the  you were my client when you were the director, so I understand you understand the political nature of this. So yes. 
So that's why I asked the question because it's not that it's gonna be DOH dealing with the Department of Defense, which is kind of an unequal partnership, which I accept. I just wanted clarification is that I know politics will be involved, and ultimately, I think it's gonna be either the governor or  I hope the legislature doesn't get involved with this; it'll just complicate things, but it's more a comment than a question. 
Right. 
Okay. So  
But I think that's the value of transparency. If we  if the criteria are on the table and the analysis is supplied in an ethical and  and open way to each option, then everybody can see it. Somebody's gonna make that call who has the authority, but the consequences of the call will be clear, and there will be some accountability.
Well, I think both DOH and the Navy 
In a perfect world.
I've gotcha. (Laughter.)
Okay. Will Congress have a  have a role in this, or is that gonna ultimately be DOD? Do you know, General Hashimoto?
Is Congress going to have a role?
In the decision.
Ma'am, I'll tell you, I'm unclear on that right now.
Okay.
I think that will be one of the outcomes of the brief to Congress in February 2024, so we'll have to follow up on that at that point in time.
Very good.
But this costs money that's not in a normal budget. Wouldn't that money be coming from Congress?
It all depends on if  are you Talking about what is the final solution or the recommendation for beneficial use? 
Well, any solution would have to be funded. 
Any solution  it may  it could be state, it could be DOD, it could be a corporation, so it would have to be funded. And so when we come down to that short list of options, that will have to be taken into consideration at that point in time. Because it might be a great option or recommendation, but if you can't get funded to  I'm making this up right now  to 2035, then maybe you might want to go with a different solution at that point in time, but that will be a future prize. 
Well, I think the Navy is getting a real clear message. If you can kind of include this on your regular updates to us, you know, just the more transparency, the criteria that Neil is talking about, and process and substance. But I don't think  the intention isn't to have all of the answers today, but clearly, we are looking at sort of the bottom line, who makes the ultimate decision on this very important issue of the reuse of those facilities. Any other questions? Aurora. 
Yeah. I just have a second question for Mr. Hampton, which was if you could recap the three parallel efforts, nation 
NDA.  
That are happening. NDA, National Defense Authorization Act, ONR has funded UH  not (inaudible) for nonfossil fuel reuse, and then  and then this.  
And then Nakupuna is the third.  
Nakupuna. So given that  I guess having worked with the community, sometimes the perception can be that people's input will be considered in its full entirety, and the reality is that it will be  it would be weighted. Do  do people who are participating in these engagements understand that?  
I think some more than others, ma'am.  
Okay.  
I can say we've collected probably about a thousand just open surveys from the website. There was another about 40 interviews, and we're expecting another couple of thousand from the mail order coming in.  
Okay.  
So you can have a wide range of recommendations there. And out of the wide range of recommendations, there  it's only going to come down to a short list of two, three, or four that ultimately get  have...  merit and are for strong consideration as the final product. So we consider everything, and this is why it was open for a wide range.
Okay.
Not only did we get a lot of recommendations, but going back to criteria, saying  some people said we don't care what it is, as long as it has this criteria in there to make sure the environment is protected and the public (inaudible). So we're collecting all of this data and information; we're in the data collection phase right now, so as we synthesize all of this information and move forward, we will have better clarity on the next steps. But you're right, with all of these recommendations, it's gonna be a  99 percent of them won't  the recommendation won't be (inaudible), and it's gonna be narrowed down to a couple. And there are some, I'll say, recommendations that are consistent between multiple individuals making their submissions.
Okay. So what is the process? We heard about the process for the selection will be based on certain criteria, but what's the process for shortlisting? Because there's a lot of stuff that can drop out, I bet.
Well, that's gonna go  all of this will be  okay. So the consolidated briefing is no
Uh-huh.
All of these three inputs are being fed back into D.C. Okay?
Okay.
D.C. will be consolidating  folks in D.C. will be consolidating this report later this year. They're working on criteria on how they're gonna approach that right now. I'm not involved in that at this point in time, but that's what they're gonna be doing to make the recommendations to the final brief to Congress in February '24.
Is there  and is the cri part of that process in D.C., or can it be? And I'm just asking because in, like, planning and participatory theory, there's rungs of engagement.
Yeah.
And consultation is sort of the lowest, and then, like, community decision-making is the highest, and the reality is it's gonna be somewhere in between. So is there  you know, in this  and it's really important for building trust to have more than that. So are you sort of engaging with those ideas of maybe shifting in order to build trust in the level of sort of community, say in at least that shortlisting?
So we do brief the community  
Yeah. 
in each and every open house we go to. 
Yeah. 
As a matter of fact, we just came up with a new flier that is  I mentioned the mail survey going out at the end of this month; it's being targeted through zip codes throughout Oʻahu. 
Okay. 
We have a flier for that. We go to neighbor boards maybe two or three a week  two or three per week, and we're presenting this at the neighborhood boards.  And as Kathy just mentioned that we have this initiative kicking off this Thursday with the CRI, which is the community relations team, which will be a small group, okay, of people that are interested in Red Hill, which they'll be talking about the progress towards Red Hill overall being environmental tank closure plan and beneficial nonfuel reuse, and maybe be meeting twice per quarter in addition to all of the other public meetings, our public outreach. So there's a lot of opportunities we've had where we do go out and speak to the public about where we are in the process and the next steps.
Right. But still very one  one way.
It's priority  I'll say it's priority right now, ma'am, because all of these three efforts are in the data-collection phase.
Uh-huh.
So until we get all of the data in 
Right, you can't 
That will help us narrow down some of the criteria and the next steps and how to synthesize the data and represent it and present it. So it's almost like a Scattergory going on right now 
Yeah.
collecting all the data, and then which will inform  help formalize 
Okay.
how we  how it's consolidated and sorted.
Yeah. I guess I'm thinking if  just as you move along, considering how much say  it's probably very different than how the Navy normally operates, but if the objective is to also build trust, then that feedback needs to come back. Because if you've taken a lot of people's time to get input 
Yeah.  
and then don't take it into account, that actually puts you in a worse place afterwards because there's deeper cynicism.  
So I think we'll have more clarity by the fall FTAC 2.  
Yeah.  
Which we will be presenting this final brief from Nakupuna of all of their results  and communicating some of the next steps that will follow on after that.  
Yeah.  
And so that's hopefully  that's one avenue.  
Okay.  
But whatever we do at the FTAC   
Uh-huh.  
we have the same material that we use for community boards and other public meetings in addition to that.  
So people will see it in different places, yeah.  
Yeah. And all of this information I'm speaking of is currently with  in reference to Nakupuna, the survey results that we've received so far   
Yeah.   
who  the people that we interviewed one on one    
Yeah.   
for the one on ones, that's all on the public-facing website right now through the QR code I showed you on the previous slide.   
Okay.   
So all of this is out there available to the public today    
Okay.   
for what's going on with this effort.   
Yeah.   
It does not elaborate on the other two efforts I told  spoke of    
Uh-huh.   
because those are independent until they get completed when we'll post the final information for those too.   
I understand.   
And when the final report is publicized    
Yeah.  -
I guess after the brief to Congress, that will also be posted here too.  
Okay. Thank you for explaining this. It does help.  
Okay, thank you, ma'am.  
Yes, Neil, go ahead.  
Well, it strikes me that this briefing of Congress is very important in terms of creating their impression of the status of the  of the issues and the background. Will you  is that an independent briefing? Is it the Navy telling its story to Congress, or will it be reflective of Department of Health and state interests?  
So I'll have to get you more information on exactly who's gonna be presenting the brief itself, but it's gonna be input from those three independent efforts going on right now. So it's not gonna be the Navy's or a point of view; it's gonna be the collective point of view of all of the input we received and recommendations that we received regardless of the source of that.  
So unless you're gonna have a representative team presenting to Congress, there probably should be a process to see what you're gonna say so that DOH and CWRM and other  Board of Water Supply can look at it and say, yeah, that's  you got it, that's what's going on here, so we all feel like Congress is being given an accurate viewof all the parties. 
So are you  in other words  sorry, Chair Chang. 
No, go ahead, Kathy. 
In other words, are you suggesting that they  that they present us the findings prior to the reports so we would have comment on it. Is that the  
I'm not sure who will summon  how this briefing occurs, whether it  you know, anybody can jump on the agenda or  but if we're not on the agenda, if it's just the Navy, then I think some prior  before that occurs, some prior discussion with these parties, the stakeholders, would be healthy  if not required, it would at least be healthy and transparent so that we know  understand, yeah, you've got our position accurately captured.  Okay, sir. I'll write that down as an action item for myself. I don't think  I don't have an answer for that right now. I  honestly, I don't think the brief to Congress is gonna be released intact before it goes to Congress, okay, but I think discussions could probably take place prior to that. 
General Hashimoto, I think we agreed on, like, quarterly updates, so this is July, I think the next update would be very close to your  I guess it's October. October, July  yeah
We'll come back with whatever frequency you require, Chair Chang.
Okay, yeah. I think we were looking at quarterly updates, so maybe the next one would be back in October, and hopefully, you'll have some greater updates. I was also hoping—you know, I think you're getting sort of an inclination from this commission about the desire to be transparent. I have greatly appreciated the updates you've provided us, sort of the candor in your process. It is so much better when you say—if you don't know, don't—you know, don't make something, but that you'll come back to us. So, again, we hope—you know, please come back to us But in the desire for transparency, I am hoping that after the report on your findings in the outreach, that report is broadly distributed to everyone who participated and more so that they have an opportunity to provide you comments on the report as well. I think, you know, in the past, we have had other very important issues where we've had minority reports that go up that the report is, you know, reflects the authors, and it may be a majority report. There may be something—there's an opportunity for someone who—a group or, you know, entities who disagree to submit at least—at least where there's additional comments or a minority report. But please think about that as a way to continue ongoing Transparency as providing us another opportunity  us being the community, another opportunity to weigh in on the report that it does reflect the community's both process and substance. 
Yes, ma'am. And Chair Chang, what I  what I can promise you is when Nakupuna's report is final  
Yeah. 
we'll have a press release announcing that it's final, along with the website where it's publicly posted. Also, there will be an email address. If anybody has any request for information or would like clarity or follow up any point, I will take all those in  all those requests, and I will respond to them. And all the responses to anybody's questions, I will also post on the public website for everybody's information. So I can  
Excellent. 
Chair. Chair Chang. 
Yes, Larry. 
Since I'm new to this process, this kind of briefing, where else have you been giving this to? The reason I ask is that the questions from the commissioners are like  we want to be able to disseminate the information to as many people as possible, but what I want to know is, is this commission the proper one or the one...-
I'll take that. There have been multiple venues where this team has presented information. You've already heard about the FTAC; that's pretty well-known. There's the House Special Committee on Red Hill, there's a Governor's Commission on Water, and there's also defueling  a specific defueling information-sharing forum as well as the ability to interact at any time.
Okay. I appreciate that because my impression was the questions were being asked by the commissioners as  like you guys gotta go out there and do more. I just want to know if this is the main forum, or do you have many forums?
I would say it's one of many that is attended by many of the commissioners here that have been ongoing.
I can respond, though. I mean, part of the feedback that we've gotten loud and clear and regularly from the public 
Can you  I have a hard time understanding what you're saying.
Yeah, yeah. I have small kids who have germs, so the feedback that we have gotten from the public from day one has been that the commission's regular open meetings have provided an important forum for exchange and questions at a time that there wasn't all of this public kind of facing organized communication. So we still get, you know, sort of that push from those who provide testimony to  to ensure that transparency happens. So it's good that it's happening through other forums now and with more regularity. 
And Larry, if I can just add to Aurora's comments, there was really  I mean, I have  since I've come on board as chair tried to use both the water commission and the land board as an opportunity for a public forum because we are one of the few agencies that actually open our meetings to the public. It was designed to create a safe space for informed decision-making, permitting, you know, issues before they are controversial, including the Navy, an opportunity. And General Hashimoto has been extremely cooperative and willing to do that, so it is  and we've asked for a comprehensive update, not just on defueling, but on all of the aspects So I think the intention for CWRM was while some of these things may be out of our regulatory lane, it is nonetheless a public platform that the community can look both at our minutes, can review our transcripts, and can all participate in our process through either YouTubing or coming and providing comment. So that's kind of the  you know, the impetus of this. But I do know that the Navy has been having numerous meetings. I did  you know, I don't know how coordinated everyone is, but this has been just our platform to create another space for good information before decisions are being made.
Okay. I'm glad about that clarification because what I'm looking at is that we are the water commission, and my focus is on water issues.
Yeah.
And so I don't want to get into wide-ranging things where we're  we're basically looking at stuff that we shouldn't be looking at. But as long as they want to be  are willing to provide information to us, and as long as some of the commissioners think it's important that we be the conduit for the public, I'm fine with that.
Okay.
But I want to remind everybody that we're the water commission, okay?
Yeah. No, appreciate that reminder, Larry. I mean  and I think that the commission is clear what our role is, but I think we also  many, many members of the commission hear public comments, and General Hashimoto 
His team have been willing to utilize our meeting as an opportunity for good, accurate, current information on a regular basis. Also, I think I'd be remiss if I didn't add the open houses these organizations hold, as well as using the City and County's neighborhood board system to get the information out. And I would like to say as valuable as it has been for us to be able to push information to the public and the commission via this meeting, I can speak for everyone here today; the insights that we have gained from your comments have been invaluable. And so making sure we meet accuracy and completion standards, we wouldn't have that kind of interaction, so mahalo for your input.
Okay, great. Any other questions? And General Hashimoto, do you have more presentations?
Oh, absolutely, Chair. I'd like to turn it over to Ms. Sarah Moody to continue information about the remediation efforts.
All right.
Good morning. My name is Sarah Moody. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. I work for Naval Facilities Engineering Command Hawai‘i overseeing the Red Hill environmental work that we're doing in regard to... I would like to speak to you today about water quality and efforts the Navy continues to ensure our water quality for our distribution system and to protect, monitor, and make sure that we're doing everything we can to ensure we have safe drinking water. Currently, we are in Period 6 of a seven-period commitment that the Navy made in March of 2022 to collect 7800 drinking water samples from the distribution system for the purpose of identifying clean water in locations, ensuring that the recovery we had done following the water crisis in November of 2021 had sustained and that we had no ongoing issues in the water system. This effort also aims to build public confidence in the drinking water system by creating an avenue for consistently collecting data, posting it publicly, and interacting with residents in the community to demonstrate that the drinking water is safe. So far, we have collected 6300 samples of drinking water from residents and facilities throughout the distribution system. We also have several locations where we continue to collect samples on a periodic basis, such as all of our schools, child development facilities, medical facilities, and any other high-risk locations. We do this with the purpose of ensuring that we are showing that the water is safe. especially for communities with at-risk populations such as our keiki. So all of that data is posted online, and it continues to be shared. We continue to see that the water remains safe to drink. We have not had a detection of JP5, of jet fuel, since we began the long-term monitoring program, and we continue to look at those results. If we identify any concern, such as an exceedance like lead, it is immediately dealt with. The family is provided bottled water, or the school or whatever of that nature, and we do the process to remediate and close out that exceedance. In addition to long-term monitoring and the monitoring we're doing for total petroleum hydrocarbons or fuel, we have also sampled our Waiawa Shaft, our primary source, which is our sole source right now for the drinking water system, for PFAS to guarantee that we don't have PFAS in our drinking water and to guarantee that's not an area of concern for our drinking water constituents. That result was non-detect. We were able to verify that the drinking water is non-detect for PFAS. We also continue to make sure we're sharing our data in a variety of avenues. We've created a website called Safe Waters, which is a sharing website that the Navy has utilized to make available the data to all members of our community. So we are able to share the data in We have data for courts or files, so the actual laboratory reports from the files shared in the library. We have data summary reports at the end of each period to be able to attempt to better explain the data that residents in the community are looking at, help them explain what that means to them and how it's relevant. We also have an interactive map which allows residents or business owners, or community members to look up an address and be able to see the data history from that specific location. Some of the feedback we've heard specifically is to make things like school names easy to search so that a parent with a student in a school can easily look up that school name and identify what the safety of the water at their child's school is and things of that nature. In addition to these efforts, we also wanted to continue to promote public outreach and community outreach. We've been setting up booths in places like the Naval Exchange facility in the lobby area, which is open to the public for people to interact with drinking water experts, look up their results, ask questions, and find out more information about the work we're doing. We are also working with our schools, hoping this fall to set up those similar booths at maybe some back-to-school events or open houses so that parents of students can help feel confidence In the drinking water for their children  can interact and ask questions and get information about the water. So those are just some of the efforts that we're doing to continue to show the water is safe and to also basically hold to our commitment that we were going to continue to sample the water. In addition to all of the efforts we're doing here, we continue to pursue sampling at the Navy Aiea Hālawa Shaft. It is our current shaft that is offline; it's been offline since December 3rd of 2021; however, we felt it was important to build data history for that location. And so starting in September of 2022, we began doing every two to three weeks a flushing to over land for about 15 to 20 minutes for the purpose of collecting samples from that location to build data history so that we could see what the water quality is like in that location for future discussions with our regulators about reuse of that location. So that's just some of the things we're doing in regards to our drinking water, and Captain Sullivan will share more about our remediation efforts and other environmental 
And if I could also, on this same topic that we do have  as Sarah mentioned, all of the testing going on, we also have a rapid response team that is available. If any resident has a concern about their water quality, if they're seeing anything unusual, they can call.over to our Emergency Operations Center, and then we'll dispatch a team to go look at the quality as well as take samples for an initial sample, and then we'll add them to make sure their location gets included within the period within the next few days for the long-term monitoring so that we can get those results. So that remains (inaudible). 
May I?   
Yes.   
These  these are your tactics. What indicators are you using to determine whether your tactics are successful so that the public feels a sense of high confidence in drinking that water?   
So that's a  that's a challenging data point to track. Obviously, we continue to take feedback from the community. If they're drinking bottled water, if they're not using their water, is that something where we can have conversations, actually go into their home and look at the water in their home and see if there's a specific issue that can be addressed. We have seen a distinct down-shift in reports and calls of concerns and things like that over the last six months or so, and so we hope that's indicative that people are starting to have confidence in their water again. But the challenge with public trust is that's a hard thing to quantify, and so all we can continue to do is act to show, sustain that we continue to hold to our word.the best reports and the gauge I have is my interactions with the community.
And if I could add to that, at a lot of these town hall events and our booths at different locations, we will have individuals to come up very concerned, very emotional at times, and take the time to walk through. We explain the results, we answer all the questions, and most of those interactions do leave with that individual feeling like they got their questions answered and at least understanding it. You know, sometimes  sometimes we can't pull back and restore that full trust, but we at least  by the mood, by the way those interactions go, and what might start as a very tense interaction, we do our best and receive indications that when that individual finally does leave the table, the booth, or the discussion, they seem to be satisfied and understanding at least of what we're doing (inaudible).
As imperfect as any measure might be, I think making an effort to just kind of identify some things that you're tracking and seeing the delta over time I think would be beneficial.
Kathy.
Yeah. So with what frequency are you  this is the questions we get. So with what frequency is the Navy testing for PFAS?
So currently, we have tested the WaiawaShaft a single time under the UCMR5, the basically unregulated contaminates program under the EPA. And so we will collect another sample this fall, seven months after that sample, to verify that. We do not currently sample for PFAS within the distribution system just because of the sensitivity of that testing procedure and the risk of cross-contamination because PFAS is so prevalent in all sorts of things in our community, in popcorn packaging and Teflon pans and things like that. So we've prioritized those efforts on the sources; both the Navy Aiea Hālawā Shaft has been tested as well as the Waiāwa Shaft.
I have a follow-up, then. So by that token, are you using EPA  what is it? Method  what methods are being used?
Sorry. So there are two separate method groups for PFAS. We  for the Waiāwa Shaft and the Navy Aiea Hālawā Shaft, we use Method 537.1 and 533, which are the EPA drinking water methods. For other PFAS efforts that we've done in the area, such as following the AFFF release or at the Red Hill Shaft, we have used Method 1633, which is the method that's been identified for environmental sampling
Okay.
And to follow on to Kathy's question for the PFAS sampling, we do continue to monitor and sample for the groundwater monitoring wells in the vicinity of the AFFF release in November of '22. So those are collected. It was weekly for the first six months after the release, and it is now two-monthly testing of those monitor wells in that vicinity for PFAS.
Yeah.
Oh, sorry. I asked because we know that those methods are limited to a certain set of known and regulated  or not regulated, but, like, you know, a subset of the possible substances that can occur. And so I guess, are you considering  maybe that's a silly question, but, you know, are there other methods that are coming online that are not regulatory or not, I guess EPA approved yet, such as AOF or TOF that really look at, like, the full  you know, you might have a contaminant event, and then it breaks down into other compounds that are still potentially harmful, but  I  and I'm saying this for the public too, like that our knowledge of how to regulate and monitor PFAS is evolving, but what are you guys doing to think about how to protect public health given the potential for contamination?
Absolutely. So we continue to work with the regulators to sample whatever methods are kind ofpreferred and asked of us from the regulators. 1633 did extend to 40 different PFAS analytes. 
Right. 
So it is a more extensive, comprehensive look; it has lower detection levels. 537.1 and 533 combined give us a pretty complete picture of the primary group of PFAS, so  and also to  under long-term monitoring, we're collecting for 60-plus analytes of all sorts of other constituents such as volatile organic compounds and semi-volatile organic compounds and anything related to total petroleum hydrocarbons. So we are already doing a pretty comprehensive sampling program; this is just adding those 40 PFAS constituents in addition to that sampling. 
And that (inaudible) of Waiapo will be moving forward  
So  so Waiapo is sampled every period. Our sources are sampled at the beginning of every period of long-term monitoring. So we do a threat  so there are seven periods in the plan. 
Okay. 
So we do a  kind of a baseline sample to make sure we're re-verifying that our source water is meeting safe drinking water standards, and then we move forward through that period. So we continue to sample the Waiawa Shaft, and we're committed throughout the defueling process to be mindful of public trust in the community and needed to take a sample from Waiwa Shaft to continue to verify to the public that the water remains safe to drink because that location is six miles from Red Hill.
Right.
Okay. Any other questions?  (No response.)  
Thank you so much.  
Thank you.  
Do you have  go ahead.  
Go on to the next slide, please.  So my name is Captain James Sullivan, and I'm the commanding officer of Naval Facilities System Engineering Command Hawai‘i. I got an opportunity, I thank you for the opportunity last fall to also brief the commission, and the slide you're looking at now is actually one of the  the results of that discussion and not just with  with CWRM, but also discussions I've had with Ernie Lau and many other key stakeholders, and that is to make sure that we have a very clear and transparent plan that's laid out so that you see all the activities that we're doing. It's updated and posted on our website, and you are able to hold us accountable just as we hold ourselves accountable for all of the actions that we're proceeding. So while this focus is on the current remediation And recovery efforts that are going on, we also have  and the Navy is committed to the long-term remediation of the site. Long after defueling, long after closure, we know that we have that responsibility to remediate that site, and those steps are beginning right now with some of the site assessments that are looking at the site in its entirety and all contaminants that may exist so that we can have a plan for what our remediation efforts may be for many, many years. In everything that we do, you know, my team is working directly with the DOH, the EPA, BWS, CWRM, USGS, and UH. Since last fall, there have been a lot of additional forums. As the general mentioned, we're briefing at whether it be the Governor's Water Committee, but we've also started  there's SME roundtables that are conducted at both the senior level as well as the working level with the SMEs where we're pulling in folks from your team, folks from Board of Water Supply and USGS, University of Hawai‘i, all to sit down and talk about are our tactics working? Are there new issues arising, or do we need to change something that we're doing right now? As well as receive any feedback that they might be receiving from their constituents. We also meet with Ernie Lau on a very regular basis. I know that there are sometimes we don't see eye to eye on an issue, but we definitely talk it out and make sure we're hearing his perspective so that it could influence our  our decision and our way forward. So while I don't intend to go into great detail into everything on this slide  again, this is what is posted on our website, and this is the  really, the tool that I utilize every time I'm briefing on one of these major forums, but I did want to call out a few key efforts that I know have been part of the decisions within this committee in the past and are very important to our continued success in the remediation of Red Hill. So moving down to the first section is the Monitoring and Sampling Effort, that first blue and the bars below it. Those are all related to our continued sampling to make sure we know what's going on in the soil but also below the soil all around Red Hill. The key area there is the monitoring well expansion. We've committed to 22 additional monitoring wells this year. We're making great progress on that. We've already got ten complete; there are four in progress, still have eight remaining. We also  on that effort, there will be another discussion in October with all of those SMEs again, members from this commission, but also with DOH, EPA, and Board of Water Supply to talk about monitoring well locations that we currently are not proceeding with. Do we need to adjust where we're putting those to make sure we fully understand what the water underneath in the aquifer is doing?
Captain, excuse me. Oh, Captain, could you  sorry. What's an SME? I'm not familiar.   
A subject matter expert.   
Okay, okay. Thank you.   
Sorry. I apologize.   
No. Sorry, sorry, sorry.   
Yeah.   
Go ahead.   
So one of  while it's much lower on the slide deck here, but what are we utilizing the data that we are getting for the monitoring wells? It is to also make sure and conduct modeling. So there are two parallel modeling efforts that we're proceeding with. We have both the Navy modeling effort where we're working with one of our contractors and have been for several years, and then there is an independent University of Hawai‘i modeling effort that we are supporting, giving them  make sure they have all of our data, any access, and helping them in any way we can, but that is a parallel modeling effort the University of Hawai‘i is doing to, again, make sure we understand what's happening below the surface, where is the groundwater flowing. Another item I would like to talk about is, you know, we mentioned  I think at the last CWRM there was some discussion on what are your current actions. The soil vapor extraction is a technology that we are proceeding with right Now. So where we're getting the tunnel and the Adit close to where the November 20 release occurred and close to the Red Hill Shaft, preparing, getting the holes that we need and the equipment that we need to do the soil vapor extraction, where this is basically we're pushing air  we've identified locations from below the surface of the tunnel all the way to the top of the aquifer where we believe there may be fuel that's trapped within those layers to where we will be pushing in air and pulling back air, out air, sucking that air out to try to pull all of that fuel that might remain anywhere trapped within the soil. So that effort is currently in progress. We're getting the equipment ready; we're getting everything we need ready to proceed with that. We also have to be very careful that none of the efforts that we're doing now, we're not gonna do anything that could in any way slow down or impact the defueling operations. So it is a little bit  there are some pauses at times, and there's a lot of working with the DOH where we know a lot of people on their team that would be reviewing and are working with this, on these plans, are also the same reviewers that are working on all of the defueling. So a little bit of patience, not moving as quickly as we would like, but still an effort that we are fully pushing forward with. Yes.
Oh, okay. A quick one.u're on monitoring. So is the data from these new monitoring wells on the groundwater sampling? 
Yes, ma'am. 
Okay. 
And so one thing of note, just like Sarah had talked about the Safe Waters website where we have interactive maps, all of the results are posted. We have developed a parallel site which is focused  we have one on drinking water, our distribution system, and then we have developed a similar site on all of the environmental groundwater samples, any soil samples, and that’s  and that’s where this remediation table is all on the environmental app. We have an interactive map on that one as well where you can click on any monitoring well that’s in the network, and you can find out what the results were for that monitoring well, but we also have all of the full detailed lab reports and everything posted on that site as well And that was one of the things that we worked very closely with Ernie Lau and the team to make sure he had access to all of the results and everything that was required of us, and we continue to every day improve the quality of that site and the user-friendliness of it. 
Thank you. 
The only  
Captain, with regard to this Monitoring and sampling, you're continuing to run the pumps and put the water into Wahiawa Stream, and there's been public concern about the effects of that water on the surface  the surface water system itself as well as the life that's dependent upon it. Is that captured in the monitoring?
It's in  in the monitoring, but also one of the efforts that we  that I was gonna talk about here in just a moment was halfway down the slide under the Adit 3 Remediation Efforts. The first and second bullet talk about the capture zone that we're maintaining within the Red Hill Shaft where we're pulling any contamination that might be in the aquifer towards the pumps so that we can collect them. If you go back to in the months following the release, you know, December all the way through the spring of '22, we recovered several hundred gallons of fuel off of the surface through the skimming operations and everything that was required. We've continued to maintain that capture zone, and we're to the point now where we're pulling about a teaspoon every 30 days off of the surface. So very, very little in quantity, but we are maintaining and pulling any contamination. But we did start a pilot study in working with all the subject matter experts to  we developed a pilot study to try to reduce the pumping to the least amount required to maintain that capture zone. So on the 20th of June, we..d that pilot study. We have resumed up to the pumping rate we were at before, about 4.3 million gallons a day. We're gathering all the data, putting it all together, and then we're gonna be sitting down again with that same group of subject matter experts to verify did we maintain the capture zone effectively and can we permanently reduce our pumping down to that 1.8 million gallons a day average. On a parallel effort to the reducing the capture zone  or reducing the pumpage required at the capture zone, we have been proceeding with  there's a military construction project, an effort for a water treatment facility that we will be installing at Red Hill. So that design has been proceeding, the design will be complete this fall. Obviously, there's still the Congressional approvals required to make sure that that military construction project is fully funded before it is awarded, but we are moving very quickly to make sure that we have that water treatment facility ready to go. Again, knowing that we do not want to forever 
Make sure 
(Inaudible.)
my simple mind understands this. So the Board of Water Supply cuts off their pumps so that you're the only draw in that aquifer.
Yes.
So all of this is coming toetting a teaspoon out a month. And then that draw then has to be  exit the system, so it goes into Wahiawa Stream after you've taken the teaspoonful out and you're monitoring that there's no more in there that's causing damage to the  the riparian?
So the  within the capture zone within the Red Hill Shaft, we are pulling and skimming from the surface of the water. The pump is pulling from 18 foot below the surface of the water to where we are testing the water quality there. We are running it through granular activated carbon treatment to strip out any TPH-related components that could exist, and then we are again testing the water at the effluent side of those GAC treatments before it is going into the Wahiawa Stream. So it's being tested prior to as well as at the exterior, and we are not pulling from the surface; we are pulling from 18 foot below.
And those tests are indicating no problem?
Correct. Those  yeah, there is not  there is no TPH that is being released into the environment at all.
Okay, thank you.
Okay. Any other questions?  (No response.)  
Go ahead
Yeah, pending any questions, I know that there's a lot of detail to give. This is why we will always keep this updated on our website, and this is the tool that we're gonna utilize any time that I'm briefing, whether  it doesn't matter what the forum is, this is  this is what we will utilize to make sure that that whole transparency is out there and we continue to move forward in it.
Excuse me, Chair. This is Wayne Katayama.
Yes.
May I ask a question?
Yes, Wayne.
Captain Sullivan, maybe you could help me with the eight remaining monitoring wells. What is your ETA on putting those online?
Our goal for all of those eight remaining is to get them complete by the end of the calendar year, but we have run into substantial issues with some of the private landowners that are in the area that are  that are not interested in us drilling a well within their area. So we continue  again, Board of Water Supply has been very helpful in helping us to maybe encourage or to work through some of the permitting requirements. Obviously, we have to follow all of the Section 106 and following all of the rules, but that's what some of our challenges have been. So I can't say that we are  we are still tracking and pushing hard to complete all 22 by the end of the calendar year, but we have some major challenges still to get through when it comes to some of especially those  those land agreements that are required.
So the calendar year is FY '24? 
I'm sorry. What was that, sir? 
Is your calendar year FY '24, or are you looking at December? 
Yeah, it would be into the beginning of fiscal year '24, end of calendar year '23. So by December of '23 is when we would like to have all 22 in place, but we are a little bit behind schedule due to those land issues right now. 
Oh, thank you, Captain. And I guess this is for maybe either you or Sarah. You know, you've talked about long-term monitoring; what organization will be in place to carry out the monitoring requirements that you're presently on, or is that gonna be different?
The 
'Cause you have quite a few resources right now  
Correct
focused on monitoring.
Yes, sir, so  so as the  I'm the commanding officer of NAVFAC Hawai‘i, and NAVFAC Hawai‘i will maintain the responsibility of proceeding with the long-term monitoring that exists currently as well as any additional follow-on monitoring that may be required. That would all fall within my organization, sir.
And have the resources been identified and funded?
They have. The individuals, as well as the resources, at least for the next couple of fiscal years, are already in place or are being put in place.
Okay.
So the funding right now is not a concern that I have.
Great. Thank you very much, Captain.
And Captain, this is Dawn. I just have a question about monitoring. I know that in response to Commissioner Hannahs  are you also monitoring down in any of the stream outflow by Pearl Harbor and its impacts to aquatic resources, marine resources?
Yes, ma'am. So one of the  following the emergency order, there is a team from the University of Hawai‘i that does ecological monitoring down in the HālavaStream to ensure that we're not impacting any wildlife or causing any issues, and so that's been ongoing, and we haven't seen any significant issue from that water coming from the GACs. So because it is clean water, it's being tested; we haven't seen any impacts to the Hālawa Stream as it's entering Pearl Harbor.
Okay, thanks. That's really helpful. So at least we've got some baseline to have some ongoing monitoring to look in the future whether there's any change. Okay, thank you for confirming that. Any other questions? I note it's almost 10:30. General Hashimoto  oh, go ahead, Aurora.
Sorry, I'm keeping people from a coffee break. So I just wanted to add, I think Ayron was working with that effort as I  is that correct, Deputy Manuel, that Ayron Strauch is working with the UH team 
I will defer to Dr. Strauch.
on that?
But kind of answering that, we've set up kind of a monitoring program with the University of Hawai‘i to be the lead on biological monitoring of Hālawa Stream, and then our staff coordinates and/or, you know, talk to the University of Hawai‘i with that research that's done. And we  we had them present, I think It was maybe six months ago, on the findings or if there were any significant findings, and they didn't find any impact at this time. But we can make the request maybe at the next quarterly to maybe do an update more formally on the Hālawā Stream biological monitoring if that's possible. 
So I do have a question, and this is for Captain Sullivan or Ms. Moody. We've talked a lot about monitoring but remediation at specific sites, but I think I'm curious because I think there's a way that the public understands the word "remediation" and the way that agencies use the term remediation. How do you define it under standard remediation? And then who is responsible not for Adit 3 or Adit 6 but aquifer cleanup if there is contamination? And maybe that's also between DOH. So I'm not sure who to direct the question to, but maybe we can start here. 
So, part of our efforts is looking at Red Hill holistically, right? It is not just a situation at Adit 3 or a —
Right. 
— situation at Adit 6. 
Yeah. 
But because we are actively defueling right now, the goal right now is to pursue site assessment planning, which will be the comprehensive look at the entire The facility, all of Red Hill, will identify any historical events that may have occurred at Red Hill that we're not currently actively pursuing. We will begin the process of active remediation or exploration as needed once we don't have fuel in the hill. Right now, that risk is not really worth starting to drill and explore; the priority is defueling. As we move forward, we will look at Red Hill as a holistic site and identify what site remediation needs to occur. This is a long-term effort. The Navy is committed to the environmental restoration of Red Hill in the long term, so we anticipate a complete, comprehensive site assessment that could take several years. Remedial project management work will be occurring with project engineers who are down in the details, looking at aerial view footage of the facility as a whole, pulling up historical data from the archives, and identifying anything that could have potentially been located or a certain piece of equipment. Do we need to pull soil from this location or things of that nature? Right now, we have very active efforts at Adit 3 because of the events in 2021, and we have specific efforts at Adit 6 following the AFFF events. Right now, monitoring is the key goal through defueling to make sure nothing has changed in the landscape, and then we'll pursue the active remediation portion and site assessment.
And that would be for both land and water, right?  
Okay, yeah.  
So there's two separate and distinct studies that are gonna be done or remediation that's gonna be done, one for land and one for the aquifer. Okay. And so how does that  that's not on this timeline, but at some point, it overlaps with the first timeline and   
Right, if  yeah, it will continue   
Yeah.  
long, long after the bars on this timeline come and go. I mean, it will be ten-plus years of   
And it would be an effort between the regulator  the regulators, in this case, would be the Department of Health and the EPA reviewing the plans and getting input from the public on the remediation efforts.  
Okay. But as a water person, I'm wondering how does the aquifer work? Because you know, when you're cleaning up soil, it stays in place.  
Not necessarily, but yeah.  
Right, no, not necessarily, but, you know, it's a little bit more straightforward. You scrape up the dirty soil, you move it offsite and put it anyways. But how does aquifer remediation proceed, or are you waiting for the groundwater monitoring modeling studies? You know, like 
Yeah, I think  I mean, I think it's a combination. We have to do the modeling to see where it's moving, but also, like Sarah had said, it really is  we really do need to, in earnest, wait until it's defueled because we want to make sure that there are studies that are being done, but if there is a drop that enters the environment in any way as a result of the defueling effort, we’re gonna have to analyze that as well.
Right.
And we're very sensitive to any penetrations, any pathways that we could create 
Create.
if there were an event to sort of 
Yeah.
And one of our primary efforts during defueling is groundwater protection efforts, so increased monitoring of the aquifer, of the soil vapor to be able tquickly identify if anything changes. 'Cause that's the beauty of having these extended periods of data is you can see changes in the data trends and then act quickly and accordingly to make sure we're taking the most protective stance possible (inaudible).
Okay. I guess I just have a little bit of trouble seeing  like we had a contamination event, it moved, it appears to not be as much of a problem anymore. It would be great to see the data that showed that if you have the data and if it is visualized. I know we can dig it up and look at it under tables, but then  and there's a system in place to do a rapid response if something bad happens during defueling, but I guess, like, it's  to me, it seems more important to have like a really tight monitoring system in place because the way model building works is like you need data to  to validate your model, so you have to have your monitoring network and, like, it has to be high frequency, and then you can build the model. But the model is only gonna tell you something useful in the future if you have a release again, which we hopefully won't  
Right.
if we're defueling. So I'm just trying to piece together what  the logic of all of it. 
So there  we have DOH, EPA, and the University of Hawai‘i has a team that is trying to understand the modeling efforts. 
Right. 
Now, currently, there are still inputs that need to be placed in to complete the model. 
Yeah. 
And you also have 37 monitoring well location inputs right now. 
Right. 
So we are actively monitoring those locations in addition to pursuing new locations. 
I think this is great. I think there's a lot of conversations here. Everybody's working really hard. If there is a good opportunity for that information to sort of be packaged into something digestible so that the public can understand and  I mean, I am a member of the public. I have an advanced degree, and I really struggle with it. Like if we can understand the roles that everybody's playing on this more  not looking up so much at what's happened, but how we're, you know, sort of building better responsiveness or awareness of what's in the aquifer. 
And I believe one of our big One of our efforts has been to improve the environmental side of our website to make it as clear as possible. So I'm not sure how familiar you are with the interactive maps we put in place as well as e-maps. So those discussions are occurring, and we're taking the recommendations from Kathy Ho and her team as well as Ernie and trying to incorporate and do just what you said, make it very easy to understand what's going on. It is a complex issue to where it's not easy to understand.
Oh, yeah.
But that's what the intent of that environmental half of the website is.
Okay, that's good. I mean, if I can request like maybe  if it's ready for a public-facing presentation at the next meeting, I think that would be very helpful because, yeah, like Dr. Miike said, we're focused on the water.
Ma'am, I'd also like to add just a little snippet here. I know people heard there's a lot of websites out there, and you're trying to say, okay, which website's for what.
Yeah.
Right? That QR code that I showed you in the tank closure graphic.
Yep.
Okay? You go there to that main website; you scroll to the bottom, and all of these other websites you heard about are listed right there at the bottom of that main page.
Okay.
You heard 
Yeah.
Safe Waters, you go to the QR code and scroll down, all  it's one-stop shopping there.
Okay.
And you can go down and go to the Safe Waters and all of these other websites you heard through those links right there, so you don't have to remember six or seven different websites.
(Inaudible.)
(Inaudible.)
Yes.
Okay. Any other questions or comments before - General Hashimoto, do you  do you have additional presentation, or does this close your presentation? 
Chair Chang, that concludes our slides. We want to say a big mahalo to everyone, the commissioners, for the opportunity to present this information about what we have been doing, what we are doing, what we plan on doing, and some things we really have to look forward to. Again, the big one, going back to Jason's initial presentation, is the start of the gravity train in mid-October for scheduled completion in January, which for historians of this crisis know that that will represent at least a year's worth of condensing of the timeframe for the safe and expeditious defueling of Red Hill, you know, which is about  it's not about the water itself, but it's about the removal of the threat to the aquifer. So really appreciate this opportunity. We greatly look forward to our next time showing up here in front of the commission, and we've got the things that we'll bring back the next time we're able to get together.  Very good. Thank you, General Hashimoto and the team. Commissioners, do you have any final questions before I let the Navy team step down? 
I will just say even your characterization in your summary, it's not just what you're doing, it's the impact and  of those actions. It's like  you can tell me what phase you're in, but I want to know what the score is.
The true art and science of this effort, that's the big takeaway.
Yeah, its impact, whether it's working.
Okay. Ready? Okay. And I do, on behalf of the water commission and at least the public that participates in our process, thank you very much, General Hashimoto, to you and your team. I think we have felt  at least I have felt this increased level of confidence in this joint task force and the transparency. But, you know, every time you let your guard down, all it takes is one, so, again, mahalo to your continued commitment and your commitment to us to provide us updates. So I'm gonna  we're gonna move the Navy off, and then we're gonna open it up for public comments, but I'm gonna take a ten-minute break. We'll come back at 10:45. All right, everyone? Thank you very much.(10:33 a.m.-10:50 a.m.)
I'm gonna call the meeting back to order. And now  thank you again to the Navy for the presentation. I'm now gonna take public comments. So we have received written testimony. Are  is there anybody in the room? I'm gonna go first there. Anybody in the room? Okay. The woman in the back, why don't you come up to the table and identify your name. 
You have three minutes. 
You'll have  yep, you'll have three minutes. 
Okay. 
And if you've submitted written testimony, know that we've reviewed your written testimony as well. Thank you. 
Okay. Thank you for allowing me to testify. I'm Susan Gorman-Chang with Shut Down Red Hill Coalition. First, I want to comment about the Navy. You know, there's an imbalance of power going on here. The Navy's presumption is they really are gonna have the final say; that's what I'm hearing. You know, when they say, We'll let you know after the briefing is written, and we'll share with you, and we'll take your comment; that is different than working alongside us, and so the  the empower  the balance in power is not right. It is our water, not the Navy's water.  Okay. So first and foremost, I wonder if you have all read this from the Department of Health, Exposure Assessment, November 2021, "Release of Jet 5 Jet Fuel Into theJoint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam Drinking Water System" by Dr. Roger Brewer. Has the Navy, the commission read this?  
I'll admit not in its full entirety.  
Oh, okay. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you so much.  And I think the report shows that jet fuel is not the only thing that should be tested. The report and presentation reveal level  the levels and seriousness of exposure that families endured regarding several chemicals in addition to JP5, and they continue to experience. To me, it is evidence of the US Navy's mishandling and lack of ability, lack of supervision of their contractors, lack of emergency preparedness to deal in any way with the November 2021 jet fuel, deicing agent, and solvents and other chemicals that were leaked into the drinking water system and ingested and inhaled by countless military and civilian households. I think the latest evidence and analysis shows without a doubt that the US Navy cannot be trusted to manage any water system without strong and continual oversight by the commissions. The most recent TFA leaks is further evidence of this mismanagement. Commissioners, this happened on your watch and continues to evolve and unfold on your watch. Commissioners, you are not the helpless orchestra that played as the Titanic sank. You have responsibility and power. You have access to our lifeboats which in this case is safeguarding our water.
I'm gonna ask you to summarize. I'm sorry. Go ahead and summarize.
Okay, I just have some more requests. I'd like you  we'd like you to have a meeting every month; it would be nice if the Navy were here every month and to have Red Hill an action item. Ask the Department of Health to update their environmental action levels to protect all water drinkers. Do not give the Navy any more permission for any more water. Decrease the Navy's water by 20 percent or whatever the imbalance of those shafts that they're not gonna be reopened. And consider pursuing a lawsuit jointly with Board of Water Supply against the corporations that created the forever chemicals, PFAs, so the creators of the chemicals must pay for remediation to take PFAs out of the water. This has just last month been successfully accomplished to the tune of a one billion dollars agreement by Chemours, DuPont and Corteva, who agreed to provide more than one billion dollars to municipalities and water 
I'm going to ask you to  this has been four minutes. But we've also received your written testimony, so thank you very much.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much  the gentleman, why don't you come on up and identify yourself, please? 
Hello, I'm Matt Garrick, a member of the public living in Mānoa, and I really appreciate the commission for having these public meetings, for allowing public testimony, and for your  time and consideration of this matter in looking into it. In one part of the meeting, I  I heard a concern whether this is relevant, and we were on the slide that was talking about the repurposing of Red Hill and whether that's relevant for this commission. And I just want to ask, don't you think that given the tanks are located in or on  right above the aquifer, depending on who you ask, that any repurposing of these tanks would have a relevant impact on our water, potentially permanent impact on our water. So I hope you consider that. The other thing I noticed from the presentation was that I didn't see anything about ag land, and it's been known that these PFAS allow these chemicals that are being polluted into the water can be taken into fish, can be taken into plants, move up the food chain, entering into our bodies. I was recently  someone recently reached out to me who lives on ag land in Aiea, and they said the military came, asked to make sure that no one was drinking any of the water that's being pumped into their homes, and then left without doing. anything. And then, the landlord on that property has tested the water but won't release the results to the residents. Their young children are bathing in this water, sometimes drinking it, even though they're being told not to, but they're little kids, so they do what they like And it's just something that I think we should look at also at the ag land because that's very important. I know you're the Commission on Water Resource Management, but if not you, who? If not when  if not now, when?
I need to respond to what you're saying.
Absolutely.
You're obviously referring to my comments when you said that I  somebody said it was irrelevant. Wrong.
Okay.
Okay?
I apologize.
I did not say that. What I said was that we were starting to range too far away from the water issue, so don't  don't go mischaracterizing my comments, please.
(Inaudible.)
Other than that  other than
Okay, thank you. Could you wrap up? Could you summarize your testimony?  
I'll just stop there. That's fine. Thank you very much.  
All right. Thank you very much for your testimony. Is there anybody else in the room that would like to provide a public comment?  (No response.)  
Okay. I'm going to go on the YouTube. I have Susan. Go ahead.  
Good morning.  
Good morning.  
Can you hear me?  
Yes.  
Okay. My written testimony contains a slide show for you since that's one of your favorite ways of getting information. In the slide show, I'm referring to several references when the Navy provides a supplement, the DOH and the EPA need to respond to it. So some of these slide show  the Navy's response to the DOH comments of 15 March closure plan, the Navy's response to EPA comments of 7 April, some information from the Closure Supplement 2, which they received after they already provided the comments, and then because  I transfer the FTAC, excerpts from the FTAC. I don't plan on going through all of these slides because I believe they're self-explanatory, so I provided talking points for my testimony. I would ask the chair if you can find out if the public can get a link to the QR code because I don't even know how to use a QR code, so that would be helpful for me and maybe for other people. The other statement I'd like to make is anything under 266 parts per billion will be designated as non-detect. I do not support any reuse of this facility. I know the legislature's looking  legislators are looking at some kind of revenue; they need to realize that it's gonna take for years to get these pipelines out, so we have plenty of time to start planning and talking. If there is money received, this money needs to be put in some kind of trust for the people that have drank and are seriously ill from the contamination. Thank you, Susan, for giving a brief update on Dr. Brewer's memo, and I can provide the video and my transcripts of that to the commission. One part of the Navy's response was 
Susan, Susan, can you summarize your testimony, your comments? 
Yes. There's two points I want to make. The Navy believes reuse is outside the UST closure requirements and are not aware of other closed USTs that have been reused for nonfuel purposes. These are taken directly from my references And the last one is during the FTAC, the DOH presented reduce, recycle, and reuse; neither the HRS 382.G nor the underground  there's nothing saying that these tanks or that place has to be reduced, recycled, and reused. I just don't want this kind of information going out unless somebody can point me to exactly a document that says USTs must be reused. Mahalo. 
Thank you very much, Susan. I've got next is  is it Abbey Seitz? If you can unmute yourself? Are you here to testify on Item B1? 
Chair, I think she's here for B3. 
Okay, okay. Is there anybody else  is it Franz? 
On Item B3, Chair. Sorry, they're just  
Okay. No, very good. Is there anybody else that I'm missing, Kathy, online? 
No.-
Okay. With that, I'm gonna close public comments. This was really just for informational; there's no action to be taken.
Chair, Chair, I have a  
Oh. 
I have a question of Susan Gorman-Chang for Shut Down Red Hill if you could return. 
Oh, sure. 
You heard the discussion of the Navy, you heard what they did report on, you heard our questions and what we sought. What did we miss? What was  what do you think are some important things that were not raised that we ought to be looking at? 
Thank you. Number one  I think Susan Pcola-Davis brought this up too  when they say non-detect, they need to give us the exact parts per trillion, whatever that is, not just not detect. 
So (inaudible) full characterization or whatever  
Yeah. 
you'd like more specific data. 
Right, correct. 
Okay.MS. 
The second thing is I'd like to know if the Department of Health is going to revise their health advisory system based on the information in this. There's a lot more chemicals people were exposed to, and taking those all at once is different than just looking for jet fuel. The health implications are really 
A larger suite of chemical analysis?
Right, right.
Yeah, yeah.
Right. Based on this Department of Health reports, are you going to revise your medical advisory that said do not just test for jet fuel in people's blood?
You know, I  we will look at that, but I  I have to talk to our toxicologists. So we'll look at that.
Okay. (Inaudible), yeah.  Okay, let me see. Yeah. Another thing, so we're all talking about reusing Red Hill, and we're all staring at this, you know, chart that says 54 percent of the people don't want it repurposed, and yet there's this assumption that we will repurpose it, and this discussion keeps going on almost deaf to the fact that most people don't want it repurposed. Why are we proceeding with trying to repurpose it? Again,like Susan said, revise, repurpose, recycle, whatever; I don't think that's a valid reason.  
Can I respond? So it is a  in all things, and in a lot of things when we're dealing with solid waste, those are the three Rs, reduce, reuse, and recycle, and so we  it's not a requirement, it  in this context. 
So you're choosing to do it. 
In this context, it's not a requirement. It is would you please look at this and determine whether, one, you can reuse it? For example, some people have said, Why don't we get the University of Hawai‘i to do a research center there, or why don't you make it into a museum? Those are reuses of that facility. It is  it may not be, but that's what people are  some people are saying. So it's not that we're gonna  that it's gonna happen, it's just will you take a look at these three criteria and see if you could reuse it and recycle it? Meaning could be taking out the pipelines and using the pipes or the electrical system and reuse it in some other way. It's just these are three  three words that we want that  we want the Navy and the public to think about. Is there a way that you can reuse or reduce or recycle this facility to make it a better facility or to make it into something different? It's not a requirement; it is a goal of ours
Okay. So there's still the option of just closing it and not repurposing it?  
Absolutely, absolutely.  
I feel like we're throwing good money after bad.  
No, absolutely.  
I thought we  we covered that. I  my question was, what did we miss? We had  we had a good discussion   (Multiple speakers.)  
of that because we said we want some criteria.  
Right.  
We want to see what the  the options are. We want a thorough analysis of each option.  
But again, as long as the (inaudible)   
And we see what the public thinks.  
Okay.  
That data is clear.  
Okay.  
So, thank you.  
Okay. That's it.  
Yeah. I'd like to bring us back to the agenda. I mean, Neil, is that what you wanted? Is that what you asked?
(Inaudible.)
Okay, all right. So hearing no other public testimony, no other  any other questions from the commission?(No response.)
I am going to close 
Chair.
Go ahead. Yes.
I do have one. So this is addressing Susan again because of the first item you brought up  and maybe Commissioner Ho. My understanding is that Dr. Brewer's findings, once released, sort of sit in the lap of what DOH takes care of. What role or what important insight do we as commissioners make when we're often tasked with water quantity issues? You know, how do we  how do we use this information to guide our efforts? Is it relevant? You know, how do  because it seems like important information. I was reading it last night.
So this assessment was really done to help CDC in its efforts.
Okay.
So that was the sole purpose for the drafting of this document. CDC will take this document.and do what it needs to do to analyze and come up with its own findings. 
Okay. This  okay. And then there's  there's this public understanding  and I'm just trying to understand  
Right, no (inaudible). 
where some of the tension or frustration may lie and  
Yeah. I feel like as Department of Health, you're supposed to be looking out for our health, and so to say that you're just gonna give it to the CDC and not, like, revise your medical advisory  
So we are  we're constantly looking  and as you know if you know Roger Brewer, we're constantly looking and revising our EALs and all kinds of things. So it is  it is something that we are constantly looking at. I can't commit to you today that we are going to change our advisory because that's not  I'm not the SME, but I can say that we will  I will bring it back to my team to look at and make a determination.
And I think it would be a disservice if you didn't, in my opinion, revise that medical advisory based on the information now that you have that it's not just jet fuel, it's the solvents, it's the deicers, it's all of those things in there. And the impact it has on people.when they're  when they're exposed to it all together.
If I may, can I intervene?
Sure.
Switching to my UH hat.
Yeah.
I think reviewing it, the complexity of the biology of this situation requires a different, you know, expertise. And I do think that is CDC, but I think there's a need for, like, you know, specialists and experts that may not be employed by DOH. So I think it's a really important landmark to convene more conversations around and what, you know, about how to  how to look for the effect of, you know, the deicers, for instance 
Yeah.
that do have neurological impacts, but are, you know, showing up in people and increasing, for instance. So I know this from my UH side. So making sense of all these different lines of evidence is really hard to do in a regulatory space. You know, a lot of us may not be specific specialists. So I think there's important conversations that need to be had and, you know, you're bringing it up here, but maybe they do need to be organized and worked out   
And I  it's been a while since I reviewed  since I've read the medical advisory, but I do believe that the medical advisory didn't prohibit anybody, anyone from seeking medical attention, and it didn't prohibit any of the doctors from doing the appropriate things that they thought were necessary. 
(Inaudible), but that's a conversation for another time. And I guess  
Yes. 
our other frustration is you're silent  
Excuse me. Can I  can I just call order to this? I want to stay in our lane. I mean, I think these are great conversations. DOH has its own platform. I would like to bring us back. I mean, we're still on the first agenda item, and there are several other presentations. So, you know, I understand the frustration, the tension. I think the intention of these public platforms was to create  provide a space for the Navy to provide us good information. Clearly, there are other platforms available for specific subject matters. And this one, Kathy, is probably more in your wheelhouse when you have other public meetings regarding DOH. So can I bring us back to the water commission? Okay? Okay. So I think that was the last testimony on the Navy's Item B -
Can I add something?   
Pardon me.   
Can Kathy Ho please let the public know when their next public forum will be? Because Susan and I would love to join you. Thank you.   
Okay. Thank you very much. I'm sure Kathy  check her website, she'll  she can make that available, but yes.
