does allow us -- you guys were on Kaua‘i when we did the Wai‘ale‘ale Stream, four or five hours of pretty heated public testimony. We had just started deliberations, someone called for a contested case; everything stopped. No more discussion. And it turned out that entity did not even have, you know, the proper standing. So I think there's -- we should really think about how we reform the contested case because I think if the commission and staff have time for a couple months to try to work out a compromise and work with stakeholders and then come back and maybe make a decision, I think we can resolve a lot of that stuff.

You know, if people want a contested case, that's fine. There are advantages. We get to sit together and deal with it. It takes too long, it's too expensive, legal issues, and we might not even agree with the hearings officer's report and end up having to go back. And I think we found in numerous situations where we go back and ask people, Can you rescind your contested case so we can actually sit down and talk? So maybe legally there's a two or three months timeout, we're not making a decision, but we're going to work on the issue, come back in a public forum, try again, and maybe there's a way that we can actually work. So I'm not suggesting we get rid of the contested cases, but it's time to have a -- kind of a serious discussion how to re-reform that with stakeholders. So that's one.
