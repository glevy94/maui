right off of the road going up towards that Mililani Cemetery. So we see in this well the freshwater lens continues to slowly thin about may -- well, about 100 feet. I don't know if you can say that's slow, but -- but it's been 37 years since we've seen that. The elevation of the midpoint of the transition zone shows a gentle rise, but again, the current elevation is still below the calculated Ghyben-Herzberg elevation, which indicates to us that the current thickness is greater than expected.

So going to the next slide, you can see again, this is -- this is Ghyben-Herzberg, that's the midpoint of -- this is the midpoint of the transition zone. So this is the top of the transition zone. So we are quite significantly below the calculated Ghyben-Herzberg midpoint of the transition zone. And again, this well is located kind of close to the Navy's Waiawa Shaft, which they are -- they've placed a hundred percent reliance on to supply water for existing.

So that's a good segue into the next portion of my presentation, which is talking about Navy system pumping centers. So --

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Ryan, Ryan, excuse me. Before you go on to the next subject.

MR. IMATA: Sure.

COMMISSIONER BUCK: I'm curious. The thickening has occurred since 2005. Could -- might the WaiƒÅhole water
