COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: So you've gotta clean it a bit before it gets -- gets to that stage, right?  
MR. ARAKAKI: That's right. So maintenance, removal of trash and debris. Let's see. This kind of shows stormwater going through the chamber, but there's also a trash and debris collection area here; these are the filters, and then it goes out downstream to Kipapa Stream.  
COMMISSIONER BUCK: Compared to what comes off the stream.  
CHAIR CHANG: Yeah.  
COMMISSIONER BUCK: (Inaudible)  
COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: What's the capacity of that? Because, like, you know, larger --  
MR. ARAKAKI: Sure.  
COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: -- could easily exceed that.  
MR. ARAKAKI: Yeah. The capacity is nowhere near the peak flows that we're designing the off-site drainage system for. It's typically -- it's very small. It's a smaller storm, one inch, one inch of rainfall.  
COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: But then the swales, too, should also function as well. I guess I'm thinking most sediment transport happens in the bigger events anyways, and so if you're only designing for the small events and -- you're kind of maybe missing some of the most significant --
