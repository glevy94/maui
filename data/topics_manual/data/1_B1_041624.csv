Dr. Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection & Management Acting Branch Chief
Staff stated the summary of request to approve SDWP applications submitted by the East Maui Irrigation Company in East Maui. This submittal was unanimously approved.
Ayron, in some cases we are making adaptations to existing infrastructure in order to achieve our purpose that are kind of old. Do we take into account the life of the infrastructure that’s going to be there and if it degrades or breaks down and compromises the instream flow standards, do we have the authority to go back and say, okay, more work needs to be done?
Definitely, I believe that the operator of any stream diversion can upgrade or repair a diversion without a permit, as needed, as long as the original design doesn’t change and they’re not increasing the capacity in that sense.
That’s their option. Do we have the authority to, if it breaks, to go back and say, no, this has to be done?
If they’re not meeting the instream flow standard, yes, or the intent of the instream flow standard. But as these get built, they are trying to design them with longevity in mind.
I was wondering, are any of these streams currently monitored by the Commission below the diversions? All of them or some of them?
We currently have monitoring stations on Hoʻolawaliʻiliʻi below the Lowrie Ditch intake, on Nāʻiliʻilihāʻele below the New Hāmākua intake, on ʻOʻopuola above the Spreckels Ditch intake, and on Kaʻaiea above the Center Ditch intake.
So the idea is to leave them in place, have these changes happen, and then track it for some amount of time to make sure we’re effective, okay. Is that data available? We got to find it on that website I keep forgetting. It might be helpful to make sure just for transparency sake, we let people know like, hey, look this is available for you if you don’t believe us or if you want to see the effects for yourself. Just because these are places that are hard to access, so you can see it virtually. Thanks.
Ayron, who pays for the monitoring?
We do.
Why don’t we pass that on to the applicant?
What mechanism do we have to do that?
As a condition for monitoring. I mean how are we supposed to monitor without having...
Dean Uyeno, acting Deputy. These gages are pressure transducers so they’re recording data every 15 minutes. It requires staff to go out every three months. I think that’s something that we’ve certainly considered in the past and how to do that, whether it’s purchasing the equipment, we have had other operators purchase equipment and Ayron has assisted with installing them.
Ayron looks like he’s got sunburn probably from running all around yesterday.
I was in Waikoloa, yesterday.
How do we enforce if we don’t have appropriate monitoring systems? I would like us and I know we’ve been talking about that but how do we ensure and elevate transparency and the public’s confidence without the necessary tools, but why should those be our burden to have to pay for those?
Can I comment? As I do monitoring work, people trust their own data. If you have say, a diverter, we would see this in Nā Wai ʻEhā, if they don’t trust the diverter, they’re not going to trust their data and so it does help to have the Commission do this but maybe there are opportunities to have other...
If we make that a condition that we have to monitor, so to me that should be part of the cost of the application. I want us to think about it, we may not be able to do that right now but I mean I do think for us to do our job, we need the tools. We should consider having the applicant, where they can, to provide for those tools.
To Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani’s point, especially in these cases where it’s a gage that’s being used for enforcement of the instream flow standard, that’s where I think we should be doing the data collection over the diverter. In some cases we’ve worked with the diverters to fund downstream USGS gages which are a lot more costly, but having that third party...
That independence. 
And EMI has been really, I mean they’ve been willing to do a lot to meet the IIFS. They have been making appropriate changes, but it would be in, I would suspect, their best interest, too, to elevate the level of compliance.
Streamflow monitoring is a very complicated and technical thing to do and it’s not necessarily just the cost of the equipment. It is our time and we take it very seriously and we dedicate about five days every two to three months to be in East Maui, if not more regularly. And that’s just for routine monitoring, not the other site visits we do and the installations that we work on. It’s a big part of the Stream Protection and Management Branch, so we definitely see the benefit. We are still fiscally limited and we don’t have the staff or time to be everywhere all at once, there’s a lot of perennial streams out there, so we have to balance across our time.
I also think for informed decision making are there trends, are we seeing differences in the quality of water, the flow of water? Having all of these stream gages are really critical in addition to enforcement, but also just for good, informed decision making as we consider things like climate change. I would, Dean, like us to start looking at what we’re doing, what we’re considering for permit application fees or water permit fees. The cost to manage this program far exceeds what are we charging, $25, $50. I mean that’s just absurd, so from an administrative standpoint I think the staff need the tools and resources to effectively do your work. Hopefully at some point in time we don’t have to have Ayron literally running into all of these streams, but we may have tools that can make his job more efficient. That’s just a comment, but I do want us to really look at that. What can we do to ensure that there are appropriate tools and how do we pass that on to the people who are benefiting from the sources?
Could you dimensionalize that? If you took all the streams and water courses of surface water, how many monitoring situations do you think there are out there, right now?
How many locations do we monitor?
Yes, how many if we were going to put a comprehensive program into all water courses for surface water in the state?
We currently fund about 50 USGS gaging stations. We’ve convinced other agencies to fund another 12 or 15 and that’s through USGS. Within the Water Commission, we operate about 55 streamflow monitoring stations that are continuous and another dozen or so that are just point...
A comprehensive program for all water courses?
Every single one? Wailua for example, is a very complicated watershed that has at least five major tributaries and we monitor three of them and we help monitor four of the ditches in there, but that doesn’t mean that’s a comprehensive monitoring plan. It’s just the most practical that we can implement. There are some streams that maybe we don’t need to monitor, especially I know we’ve talked about monitoring the Hanakāpiʻai or Kalalau Streams on the Nāpali. But really, yes, other than monitoring for climate change impacts to our natural environment, it doesn’t serve a management role which we’re trying to focus on. What is necessary to implement a sound management plan.
In a sampling approach. Thank you.
There are probably 120 gages necessary, if not 150 statewide as a minimum, and we’re at maybe 100.
That’s doable, that seems to be an attainable goal. If we can ensure that the costs are appropriately...to those that are...I don’t know how we do enforcement without that tool. I think that it would be in their best interest. There’s perception that they’re not complying. In the absence of having tools, how do we confirm that? Again, I think that there’s some benefit to the applicant as well. Long-term, not so long-term resolution, hopefully we can think about that sooner rather than later.
Our previous deputy had requested adding about five USGS gages a year to the annual cooperative agreement, which is about $250,000 to $300,000 needed, in addition to the operating and maintenance costs. That’s where we were hoping to do the request from the leg(islature).
I know that Katie is going to give a report on some of the Congressional funding that we’ve got, but I think if it’s a shared cost with the applicant, that’s something that we should consider.
Just a quick comment, there was a 2020 study done by the USGS that outlined monitoring needs statewide and that accounted for upwards of $170 million worth of needs. That’s something that we do reference when thinking about costs and what we could take on as an agency.
That might be a little bit too big.
Yeah, it’s a huge amount of money needed but just to put it into context.
Sort of taking it in phases or prioritizing where are the more key places, especially if we have to enforce. So think about that.
I just appreciate all the work that CWRM staff has done in preparation for this and just ask the Commissioners to take this into consideration.
Thank you, Mark. Have you heard just the previous conversation about having the applicant install or pay for some monitoring gages?
I have. We currently pay for some USGS gauges but are willing to have that conversation.
Very good, thank you so much. I appreciate that.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this permit and thank you for getting these permits moving along thanks to EMI and the staff for the tremendous amount of work put into all the reports and all the field work that Ayron has done. I have a couple of comments, I’m testifying on behalf of the Sierra Club here, Maui group. First of all, do support having some allocation for Hawaiian Home Lands and for their non-potable use. I’m assuming that would be through Haʻikū Ditch which goes to Pūlehunui, their future development. Hope that that can work out because that is a water source for them. Secondly, I’d like to speak to the proposed modifications for the Hanawana, this is the Diversion 177 or commonly known as Lowrie or L13 to prevent clogging. This is action 2.8.1 for those of you who follow that. My understanding is from having visited that intake a number of times over the years is that there’s two problems. One is that the pipe clogs up and the other is that the pipe clogs up because the area that is available to accumulate water to go into the pipe is actually not very large and of course, it’s subject to debris. I don’t know if just putting in the larger pipe, modifying the pipe, will really solve the problem there. At the time when we did the site visit, it was discussed having some sort of a bypass. The whole stream at that point, Hanawana Stream runs into the Lowrie Ditch and the pipe is just above that intersection with the ditch and the pipe. The pipe is kind of a stop gap measure, but a channel that would go over the ditch would be a better long-term implementation. I wonder if anyone from the community was out there to discuss the size of the pipe that was needed. There’s a number of people that do depend upon that pipe. This is a popular neighborhood, Hanawana, it’s not someplace where nobody lives, I’d say several hundred people live there on little farms. Once again that this is why having the community involved and understanding what is proposed with an on-site visit is just so important. I understand we don’t want to hold up these permits in any way, but if there is time when we talked about this other on-site visit for the previous permit, it would be good to include Hanawana in that site visit along with other streams mentioned like Hoʻolawa and Waipiʻo, etc. Moving on about the discussion of passing the costs of the monitoring and gages onto the applicant, it is common that conditions of zoning at the county level do pass costs of like monitoring for water quality onto the applicant. However, there is that caveat that the applicant chooses their own consultant. I agree with the comments that the best and most reliable information does come from the CWRM staff and so if there was a way that a fund could be established to help support that and expand that and it was legally permissible, I think our community would be in support of that. Also, I just want to say that in general, there has been a lot of thought put into the recreational uses. The Hoʻolawa Stream, especially, has a lot of recreational use and is well managed and it has a lot of diversions. A few are being modified, but once again that is a place where really the community, this is in their backyard, literally. Twin Falls community, the community should be standing there understanding what is proposed to happen where on at least one public visit. If that can be arranged, doesn’t have to hold up any of the implementation, but if that could be arranged, it would really be keeping with the intent of the 2018 revisions to the streamflow where the idea was to really do this in a manner that was easily understood to the public. That was one of the goals that was set there and I think a lot of efforts were made. I have to say, we used to have regular visits in our neighborhood with CWRM staff and EMI staff and talk about how things were being modified. It didn’t seem to be prohibitive to do. It was fewer diversions, but it happened and it was very productive. Thank you for your time and understanding and for moving these permits forward so that we can start seeing our stream flows protected and monitored on a long- term basis.
Aloha, I work with Lucienne with the Sierra Club. I want to mention three things quickly. First, I want to thank both Ayron and Mark Vaught for this submittal which represents some progress on the ground and we’re hopeful. Secondly, I want to address Chair Chang’s concern about paying for monitoring. Your Deputy AG may be concerned about your legal authority in this context to assess a fee, but clearly the Board of Land and Natural Resource has the legal authority under 171-55 to require that A&B (Alexander & Baldwin) pay for monitoring of these streams. That’s clearly within the Board’s jurisdiction, no question. You folks probably can do it as well, but there’s certainly no question the Board can do it. Finally, the Board has now been assessing a fee to require A&B to pay for some watershed management which is progress. The charge the Board is assessing is not as much as we think it should be, but it’s better than it was before when it was nothing. The Board could and should also be charging A&B a fee to monitor the streams. We’ve been asking that for years and Chair Case wouldn’t let us get to first base on that, but hopefully that can be a discussion the Board of Land Natural Resources has. The third thing I want to mention is it would be helpful if you folks imposed some sort of deadline. This is, I believe, the third set of applications for modifications of structures on the Huelo streams. You approved the first one, I think it was last May. My understanding is no work has occurred on those diversion structures. My information may be outdated, but I would like you folks to ask A&B, EMI what the status is of the alteration diversion structures and what’s a deadline for these. We recognize, as Commissioner Hannahs pointed out earlier, there may be in the Red Hill context, that there may be reasons why deadlines can’t be met. Maybe there’s a permitting issue, maybe there are weather conditions, whatever. I think it’s important that you folks set a deadline and also get a status of what you guys have already required because we have no idea what the status is of all the modifications you’ve already made and when these ones will be made. Thank you very much.
Just the standard Stream Diversion Works permit has a two-year window and obviously there are other potential permits necessary whether it’s an SMA, whether it’s CDUP, whether it’s Army Corps that have to be obtained for certain permitting requirements. I believe that the Stream Diversion Works permit can also be extended, but at the moment there’s a two-year window.
Thank you for that clarification.
I just appreciate, Ayron, this detailed rundown and the testimony. And the comment also about progress, maybe this is for Mark. Given like the number of modifications that are happening, do you folks have a capacity or staff who could maybe just develop a web dashboard to show where these different projects are at and maybe what the holdups are on some? Okay, we’re waiting for this permit or that permit, just so you’re not answering the same questions all the time. There’s probably real reasons that things may be held up.
Mahalo for your question. I would have to check into the web dashboard thing, to be perfectly honest, I’m not that smart so I don’t know too much about technology and what that entails, but I’m willing to ask the questions. I do know, I’d have to check with our our consultants as far as the permitting because I know that’s where things were getting a little bit sticky, going all the way through the permits and SHPD (State Historical Preservation Division) and everything else. But I don’t know, I could find out and try to update the status on the permits.
And I just want to share, I’m learning with my students. There’s some amazingly easy web mapping tools that are now available. I’m just thinking, I teach a class and I might have students mock something up to get the ideas going about what a potential communication...I understand you guys don’t have as much money as the US Navy for these kinds of things, but I think it would be helpful... these ideas of dashboards I got from you (pointing to Commissioner Hannahs). I’ve seen what helps. 
I’m pretty sure the Navy has a lot of money.
I’m thinking about like Maui College students and these data science projects. I’d be happy to maybe suggest some ideas. That was more of a comment and an idea.
Appreciate it, thank you.
Can I ask, Ayron, how many streams are we actually monitoring that are related to this in East Maui, specifically on this agenda item.
Oh on this agenda item, including what we pay USGS to monitor? CHAIR CHANG: Yes.
In some locations, there are multiple monitoring stations. I know Honopou is no longer diverted, but it was originally. We have a long-term monitoring station that we pay USGS to maintain on Honopou. We’re monitoring at Hoʻolawaliʻiliʻi, we’re monitoring Hoalua, natural flow. We’re paying USGS to monitor Nāʻiliʻilihāʻele, natural flow. We’re monitoring the IIFS at one location on Nāʻiliʻilihāʻele. We’re doing point measurements on Ohanui and Kailua, we’re monitoring ʻOʻopuola continuously, the IIFS. We’re monitoring Kaʻaiea continuously, the IIFS.
Maybe I should ask you the other way around.
I’m sorry I don’t have a number, I have to go through in my head where they’re located.
I probably interfered with your walking through.
I would say roughly 14 places in the Huelo license area.
How many are not being monitored?
It depends if you want to monitor natural flow conditions above the system or regulated flow conditions of the IIFS.
No, that’s a question I’ll ask you. If the locations are dependent upon areas...
For example, Hoʻolawanui, we’ve done a partial record gaging for two years and the low flow conditions in that station are very tightly related to the index station or the Honopou Stream flow. We can say with confidence whatever is flowing in Honopou, we can calculate what is flowing in Hoʻolawanui. In Hoʻolua, the relationship is less confident, so that’s why we added a natural flow monitoring station to monitor natural flow conditions that exist in Hoʻolua over time. Again, with changing climate patterns, changing forest cover, we want to know how much water is available to meet all of the off stream needs. Nāʻiliʻilihāʻele is a big watershed. We added a USGS gauge to that stream or really reestablished a discontinued USGS gauge in 2021. That station monitors above the Wailoa Ditch. We monitor below the new Hāmākua Ditch.
If I was to make a recommendation?
But there are three other locations I could potentially monitor, just it’s not really accessible. Once these structural modifications get met, we know for a fact that the low-flow is going to stay in the stream. So do we need to absolutely monitor every location? No, that’s why the recommendations were kind of put or designed to keep the low flows in the streams structurally instead of manually. There are some places in the state where the IIFS is met because somebody’s opening a valve, and we don’t want to have to run around and make sure all those valves stay open.
If I made a condition that or recommended a condition that the applicant and CWRM coordinate a monitoring program?
I mean we work well with USGS, I mean EMI.
Yeah, that’s the impression I’m getting. Is that something so that you could prioritize? Again, my concern is compliance and our ability to enforce and our ability to also raise the level of confidence that what is going on is actually happening. Is that something if I recommended a condition that CWRM and the applicant work together to fill in the gaps of where we don’t have adequate monitoring?
To me, it would depend on what defines adequate monitoring because we monitor pretty much every stream in some capacity. The question is once the modifications get implemented, do we see the response in the hydrology that we expect and that’s where we’re monitoring streams that we have low certainty. We’re implementing a very well-coordinated monitoring plan.
Do you need any more monitoring? 24
We need more money and more staff.
Okay, but for this agenda I cannot go beyond the agenda item.
I think on Huelo we already spend a substantial amount of our resources monitoring. We were working with DAR to monitor the streams, stream health in terms of biota. There are only 365 days a year, but we have implemented what we can.
This may not happen again, so it is an opportunity. I don’t want to make a condition if there’s no need for it.
We have allocated our resources appropriately to effectively monitor the Huelo region.
Okay, with that being said then I won’t make any. As you look at future submittals, if that is something you want the Board to consider, I would recommend that staff include that as a condition based upon what’s the rationale, how much do you need, what are you recommending. But based upon what I’m hearing today, it may not be necessary because you’ve got a good working relationship with Mark and his team and you do seem to have adequate resources.
Really what’s limiting us as a State would be staff on Maui, whether it’s in DAR or CWRM. People that can do things more regularly than we can when it comes to very time intensive investigations like biota surveys.
Okay, that may be above my pay grade right now, it’s probably not above my pay grade. It’s probably at my pay grade, I think the buck stops here. But that’s a larger question, so I’m going to go back to the agenda item.
