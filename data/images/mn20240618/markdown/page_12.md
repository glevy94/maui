**COMMISSIONER HO:** Another question. Along those lines, Ryan, you mentioned that we have 90 or that you have 90 days to issue a permit. Is the consequence if you don't issue the permit within 90 days, it will be deemed approved or what is it? I know there's a statute.

**RYAN IMATA:** I've been reading a lot of your guys' rules, the Department of Health rules lately, and I noticed that there is an automatic approval if something isn't reviewed and approved within a statutory deadline. We don't have any of that in the HRS or the HAR so the read from our AG's office, and again I don't know if… The answer from our Deputy AGs has been that automatic approval isn't done because of lack of adherence to that 90-day statutory deadline.

**CHAIR CHANG:** So what's the consequence, Ryan, if you don't approve it in 90 days?

**RYAN IMATA:** There is no consequence.

**COMMISSIONER HO:** I just wondered why, I wondered why you said you had to approve it within 90 days. I thought there was a consequence.

**RYAN IMATA:** As much as possible, we try to follow the law. I mean that's our job is to make sure that we follow the law. Unfortunately, again with the change in delegation and a lot of the changes that are happening, I don't think it's stated enough to the Commission that Groundwater Branch has extreme challenges with getting things done. I’m looking at who is here to testify, I see Barry is here. I know that there's been a lot of push back, there have been a lot of people that call me that you guys aren't aware about that are pretty upset about the process taking so long and how this delegation adds to that concern for time. On the one hand, I do understand the ability to provide an opportunity for public input, I respect the fact that there are changes that have happened since 1997, but I'm looking at it from the perspective of trying to make sure that I focus the things that you guys need to see and the important issues and taking away the things that I think are much more routine and ministerial in terms of people complying with those and not needing to go to you guys for approval. That's all my concern is.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Ryan, I believe at one time you did some statistics. What is a total number of Well Construction and Pump Installation permits and because I think hearing Andrew's comments about…so what's the issue you have? You're saying that there's so many permits and that you're not able to dedicate the time to the harder issues. So out of the total permits, how many permits would fall under this number one where it meets the standards? Because you had given to me some statistics on Hawaiian Paradise that you said something like over 50% of all the well permits come from Hawaii Paradise. Am I making that up or is that true?
