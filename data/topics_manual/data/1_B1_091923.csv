I just have two. In Recommendations A & B I would change the “should,” “the permitee should brief” to “shall,” “they shall brief the neighborhood board.” In Recommendation B, “the permitee should employ,” “the permitee shall employ best management practices.” It should be mandatory.
DOT, the applicant, do you have anything else you want to add to the presentation? Or do you have any issues with my change recommendations to “should” to “shall”? DOT, are you there? Go ahead, Jennifer.
We have no issue with adding the “shall.”
Very good. Does your consultant, do you have anything else you want to add?
