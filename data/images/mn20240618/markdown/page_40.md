Minutes  

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** Dean, from what you know about this project in the back of the envelope, what do you think the water requirement is going to be?  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** At Pu‘ukoli‘i?  

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** Yes.  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** I have no idea, I can't recall what the…  

**CHAIR CHANG:** That's a new use, too, right?  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** They have a master plan for the development, so I'm sure it's on the book somewhere. I just haven't looked at it closely.  

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** That would give you sort of an idea of what the pressure is going to look like literally.  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** I think that's where the reuse is going to be very important because that may free up a lot of water that would otherwise be used for irrigation.  

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** I'm out of touch a bit but with respect, you asked the question about the water reuse plan from the Lahaina treatment plant and my understanding is R1's been available for quite a while, like three years now. It's been used primarily along the coast for irrigation, production of the treated water. Negotiations are continuing for acquisition of a larger reservoir further up the hill that will provide distribution of the R1 water, wider spectrum. Of course it would have to be pumped up to Pu‘ukoli‘i to be used up there, but that's project cost. It's my understanding that negotiations are continuing and they're headed in the right direction with respect to acquisition of an old reservoir. It's still in use, in pretty good shape and that would solve a lot of the distribution and reuse questions.  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** There's a map on the County website that does show their plans going up to that higher reservoir.  

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** My connection might be a little unstable. I just wanted to offer a little bright spot at least for me is that the Water Resources Research Center, we've got a lot of new faculty coming in including a drinking water specialist. We have wastewater - very energetic and in a second year wastewater specialist. I hope we can really build some stronger bridges with the agencies and take advantage of that. I don't want to throw Emily under the bus, but she's done potable reuse in different places on the continent. I hope just knowing that there are specialists at UH, I hope they can inform that really important work.
