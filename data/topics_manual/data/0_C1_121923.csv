Briefing on the Adoption of the Kaua‘i Water Use and Development Plan Update
Neal Fujii (CWRM State Drought & Water Conservation Coordinator), Amanda Waki (Fukunaga & Associates) Staff presented background information on the Kauaʻi Water Use and Development Plan. The consultant then shared key tasks, finds, recommendations, and next steps in the plan.
Your last column, percent of land, is that the percent of land that's irrigable and that's the limit by amount of water you have or is that?
For the Kīlauea aquifer system area, if there's only 0.3 million gallons of supply and you wanted to irrigate at 3,400 gallons per acre per day, you could only irrigate 5% of the 1,700. Again, the 0.32 is the best available published number that there is.
Seems high. Okay, I just wanted clarification about that percentage.
Department of Water Supply and Kauaʻi supports about what percentage of the population or the island? Because you named different purveyors but just for me to get a sense of who are the players there for drinking, for portable water.
I don't know about an exact percentage but it is the vast majority of the island. There are, as Amanda mentioned, Princeville, Gay & Robinson a couple of the small State sites, but if I were to guess would be in the 99% area.
Thank you for your presentation. Lucky you live Kauaʻi. The gap between use and sustainable yield, Kauaʻi truly exemplifies waiwai. The literal meaning of that word, you’re blessed with a rich resource. Neal, this is in part for C1 as well. When I look at slide 3 and see what is characterized as being protective, that our role is to be protective of a resource, I don't think that really speaks as well as it could to what this body does. You shared with us I believe at our last meeting the constitutional preamble that recognizes Hawaiʻi’s desire to really celebrate the uniqueness of our islands and expresses the state motto, ua mau ke ʻea o ka ʻāina i ka pono, and that we wish to preserve this. I think we have a more active role, not just a protective, security guard role but to balance the interests of the life of the land with the needs of the people, not only in this generation but in future generations. Let's be real clear that we're not just trying to hold back stuff from people who want stuff now, we're trying to balance the needs and interests of what the land needs and the ʻāina needs, what the Lāhui needs, and what future generations need. I would hope that we really express that a little bit more clearly. These are just shorthand labels of course, I'm not trying to wordsmith, but I really want to make sure we get what we do correctly. In your district-by-district models, you have sustainable yield as a static assumption and you had growth demand as a dynamic assumption. Do you have access to data? Because I don't think sustainable yield is going to be static and it'd be fairer and more accurate if we had access, whether from our team or USGS or whoever to really reflect what we've heard. It's way more impactful on an island like Maui or some of the other islands that aren't blessed with your resources to understand that sustainable yield may be here now but it may go down in the future because of the climatic change. I think it would build up the presentation if we had dynamic assumptions about where sustainable yield is going to be in the future. You’re at such a big gap I don't think it's going to matter, but I think it's the discipline of looking at things in that matter. The final comment I have is how long are we going to keep clinging to plantation era assumptions about agricultural land? Plantations are gone, they're not coming back. We're in a new era and I don't put this all on the county or the consultants and so forth, but as a community we need to really rethink those assumptions to what the need is now and what the need will be in the future as we develop sustainable food systems and so forth. We're not developing new plantations, it's going to be something different. If you have comments or questions or comments on the comments but I guess there's more comments than questions.
I'll just say thank you for those comments and with respect to future sustainable yields and climate change, we spoke with the Water Department and the consultant about that and the approach right now is these are actually established by the Commission. But we will be looking at possible future adjustments to sustainable yield based on future rainfall estimates, future recharge estimates, so that's something that if we do adjust these plans, we’ll adjust accordingly as Amanda was talking about a living document. That’s a good point.
Can I add on? Just because the climate change conversation came up. Are you aware you can now access models of future rainfall projections for the island and is that incorporated? I know usually you look to Water Resource Protection Plan for this information but really starting the conversation right now while you're in these public interfaces about how to think proactively about the future declines in rainfall which are looking like they're over the center of the island. That's going to affect your base flow or your groundwater perhaps, even in wet season.
In the part we just have a general description of the potential impact of climate change. We do have the old rainfall atlas in there, we can maybe look at if a graph could be added.
Right now the Hawaii Climate Data Portal builds off of the atlas and you can look at future projections. There are different scenarios, there are some models that are a little bit more conservative, but you could see the range of projections and I think that's the best available science right now. Anybody can access it, just look up Hawaii Climate Data Portal. As you're talking, I'm looking up this data and going, okay. I think it would strengthen the Water Use Development Plan and really start the conversations at the community when you guys are having these where it needs to be at, like what does this mean for agriculture and the water quality in wells whatnot. I just wanted to point that out because sometimes the connection between the science and the decision-making is a little bit far.
Can I ask a question on that? I like that idea as far as incorporating it. Would it be directly impacting the sustainable yield because we just pulled that from the Water Resource Protection Plan or would it be a chapter that describes how it might impact the sustainable yield?
The hard thing is people can predict rainfall but translating that into recharge, that's really tricky and takes time so I don't know if you want to wait on that, but this is already available on rainfall. You can say, well this is how we think it might affect dry season flows, wet season flows like irrigation demand because temperatures are increasing. There's going to be more evaporative demand and it might be a little bit more qualitative, but I think it's good because people are already thinking about this on Kauaʻi with flooding. If things are going to be a little bit more extreme, how do you have to manage for a less certain future? Even if you don't know you still have to prepare, so I think it would be really helpful to have that conversation in this.
Amanda, thank you for your presentation. You're using 2015 as your starting point. There have been quite a few, to me, cosmic events between now and 2015. Does that impact your analysis or how is that being comprehended in your analysis with the Kauaʻi General Plan? Secondly, at least on the non-potable existing water uses there's quite a few TBDs. Will you be looking to somehow capture that by the time the final plan is submitted for acceptance?
To start off with the first question, we started in 2015 back when the description was approved. We did pause for a bit because we were waiting to see what the sustainable yield number came out to. It took a little bit of time to develop the full report. During that time, the 2018 General Plan was developed and before the 2018 General Plan was developed around the same time that we were working on the analysis, they had done a technical memorandum to look at these projections, so we are in line with their projected amounts. And yes, as you mentioned it was prior to some of these events happening, so we can take a look back and see if there's any adjustment. Overall, I think the bottom line is that the 20-year projections as you could see in the graphs were down at the bottom. Even if they did slow down during certain years or if there are slight adjustments, it's in the overall magnitude compared to sustainable yield, compared to full buildout, they would be somewhat insignificant.
Another thing to add, in that 2020 period of COVID the water demands and all of those things were not normal within that period. It seems maybe more within that 2015 or 2020 period might have been a possible look, but it seems like in the most recent years if we were to pull that data, it's still on the lower side of what it was historically around that 2015, 2014 time.
Second question about the lack of information on surface water, we'll touch base with Ayron and CWRM on if there's anything more recent, but generally the Agricultural Water Development Plan hasn't provided that and that's where we would otherwise get that information. It's kind of beyond what the Department of Water is able to do to gather that data.
There was a question asked earlier about the number of the amount of users that the Department of Water captures. How many private water purveyors are there on the island?
Four? I think it's again Robinson, Princeville, the State Parks, and then DHHL.
And they provide metered water to their PUC-regulated companies?
Yes, I'm not exactly sure about the State, those are in the State parks like Polihale and Kōkeʻe. There are maybe much smaller service areas, I'm not exactly sure how…are they regulated as a public? I'm not really sure about those.
My question is, you're capturing domestic water use for a certain population of the island, how are the private water users being integrated into the Water Use Plan? I see the municipal, I see the private water systems.
The private water systems are reflected in there because most of them do report. What you might have noticed or maybe what you're referring to is that in some areas domestic well usage wasn't. There's poor reportage in some cases so those might not have been reflected in the 20-year projections.
Essentially, whatever we were able to obtain and collect is what is included in the report.
I guess is there a sense of what is missing? Is it material to your analysis?
It would just be the domestic wells, so we can take a look back. The most significant would be Kīlauea that there were a handful of domestic wells and very little reportage but some of the domestic wells even though there are plenty, the amount of usage there versus a Department of Water system is different, the scope or the amount.
Those were concerns brought up by the community as far as the request to make sure that the reporting is better or the data that we're able to pull into our report is collected so that we can include it in our report.
One last question and personally related to this is that in your projected water use slide for the Hanapēpē aquifer you have listed 904 acres at 3 million gallons a day. Is the coffee farm, the 2,700 acres part of the Makaweli or the Hanapēpē projected agricultural water use?
I need to double check on that. I can get back to you on that.
I believe the 2,600 acres is just the Makaweli side of the ag portion. My last question is, how do you account for water that's being diverted from one aquifer to the next? Plantations used to do a lot of that and there's still some of that going on currently, surface water.
In the surface water tables that were shown where we tied the diversion to an irrigation system and we didn't know if the service area was in a different aquifer system area. Say, well kind of a moot point now, but say Kekaha and Kōkeʻe Ditch. One of them was actually associated with a gaging station that was in Nāpali but we knew that the service area was down in Kekaha so we did move that over to the service area location.
In your projected water use, on your percent of land that can be irrigated it's comprehended that number?
I know that there’s been a community desire for greater housing development, so when we talk about full buildout, does that include any of the future housing development plans?
Within the State Plan there includes those projects. As far as other ones it’s just based on if it was built on the current zoning.
The recent community plans, the Līhuʻe and South Kauaʻi community plans were also assessed.
I know you did a recent update on all of your development plans, right? Kauaʻi just recently passed a couple years ago?
I think there was the Līhuʻe, South Kauaʻi, and West Kauaʻi.
As Neil said, you are in a very fortunate situation. If we could only…yes.
Maybe we can ship some over.
I was very careful about saying, we're not going to pump anything from one island to the next. We would have had 500 people coming to our doors. You are extremely blessed so take care of what you've got.
It has to do with surface water, Kauaʻi is a little bit different. Hanalei is a major poi producing area so how are irrigated kalo lands considered in agricultural water demand or are you only looking at the plantation infrastructure? From an agricultural side it's still an important agricultural production, but in other settings it's sort of a competing interest and on Kauaʻi it's part of the agricultural picture.
The agricultural analysis, what we showed very overall broad brush, looked at the important agricultural land study. We do know that kalo can use a lot of water but we also know that it is flow through. We can take another look at that and how it's incorporated. We also do know of DHHL’s demands that were put into the State Water Projects Plan.
Was your question related to how is it accounted for in the report or how is it managed as a resource?
When you were looking at like agricultural water use you used that 3,400 number and then you constrained it by available surface water based on diversions. Those would be plantation diversions, ʻauwai are not metered so I understand that. It's interesting because Kauaʻi challenges us to think about what we call agriculture is often not inclusive of traditional agriculture. Maybe there's a different way to think about it that makes sense for the island of Kauaʻi which is dependent or in this particular area. Water flows through it, irrigation for kalo is not a competing issue it's actually the main focus for Hanalei and maybe Makaweli. This is the intellectual in me thinking, huh Kauaʻi can make us think differently about water and irrigation and agriculture, given its diverse landscapes. Maybe I need to follow up with you on this but how we account for what's available surface water and what's agricultural production and how to make sure we have water for agricultural production should incorporate the diversity of things that are being grown. I don't know if that makes sense, maybe somebody can encapsulate it better, but it occurred to me that it's not only the plantation diversions that are important ag waters. If that can be addressed somehow or identified how you think about that. The last thing I had was you gave a lot of graphs but do you have these in map form about existing demand and projected growth like heat maps? The public and decision makers think in maps, not graphs often. Do you have those?
These are our main graphs, we’ll need to talk to the Department of Water on if there's another graphic that would be helpful.
So it's mostly graphs?
It's mostly graphs like that.
It's basically summarized that there's the initial island where it has all the aquifer systems and then it shows the breakdown of the hydrologic unit areas. As far as the translation of the information back to those, you'd have to kind of go back and forth between this is the visual area on the island and then this is the graph of that area.
I'm saying this because there are metrics that are water stress indicators. They're used in global development but they can kind of help you identify it might be a ratio of supply to demand to highlight graphically some of the hot spots because the human brain doesn't generally look at a graph and go, ah ha! It might be useful for, well I know you guys are at the end of this process but helping explain and have good conversations in specific places. Just want to suggest.
3,400 gallons per day, is that a standard number that's being accepted by the agricultural community for how much you need per acre?
It was just pulled from that report. That's why, right?
We use 2,500?
Because that's a big difference.
The 2,500 was used in Waiāhole and then 3,400 is out of the Ag Water Use and Development Plan which they only looked at a specific area and with a specific climate. Like Amanda mentioned in her presentation, that may vary but it's a planning number. It might be a little on the higher side, a little conservative in that sense I suppose, but people use it.
Versus a 2,500? Is that becoming a more acceptable number, the 34 versus the 25?
I see people using the 3,400 referencing the 2004 Agricultural Water Use and Development Plan.
It makes a big difference when you're calculating several thousand acres.
It does for sure but it's adopted plan, as well.
Just anecdotally, it seems to me Kauaʻi has a lot more rainfall than the other islands. I don't know how you would factor that in, but when you talk about averages it’s going to differ not just by crop but by where you are.
Sure and when it comes down to actual evaluation in water management areas, staff does use the IWREDSS (Irrigation Water Requirement Estimation Decision Support System) which is a demand model looking at climate, soil type, cropping, cropping practices and things like that to get a more accurate estimate. But for planning purposes it could be on the high side given Kauaʻi is probably the wettest island, but there are some dry sides as you know.
Let me let me ask another question then. How significant are reservoirs on Kauaʻi in terms of agricultural irrigation? All I know about reservoirs on Kauaʻi are the ones that busted but it seems to me that if we're talking about reservoirs, are they just an insignificant amount of water over there for agriculture or are they a significant source?
There are several significant reservoirs remaining.
It seems to me that with climate change people start worrying about whether they should start storing more water in the future.
There's definitely a lot of feedback as far as discussions about land owners or reservoir owners looking to decommission them for liability and all that maintenance related activities and cost. Then there's definitely a lot of feedback from some of the communities as far as expressing the interest to keep them for the purpose of ag and promoting all of these kind of things. I don't know how to truly respond since it's not really part of the Water Departments but we do acknowledge and I wanted to relay that that is a concern.
It was just a curiosity question, that's all.
I will say that our engineering department as a result of Kaloko, legislation was passed where we are doing dam safety. There's been a major push by our engineering department, they've done an assessment of all the dams and reservoirs and they've issued notices of violations. People are having a choice, you either upgrade or you decommission but there's a tension now between fire suppression that these reservoirs should be made available. Last week Friday at the Land Board meeting, I think it was in Kalihiwai or maybe it was Wailua the original landowner had proposed to decommission, that new land owners, a hui, have now reconsidered and it's quite a large reservoir. People are paying a lot more attention. There is a $10 million grant program, that's monies that will be available to private land owners to upgrade or even decommission their reservoirs but again I think with fire suppression becoming a real concern there is a reconsideration by some including government on whether we should be taking over some of those reservoirs to ensure an adequate amount of water is available for fire suppression.
The Kīlauea public meeting, which is the nearest to Kalihiwai, that was one of the big items.
That was a positive movement by those land owners.
Chair, I want to go back to your point about the average requirement to support agriculture. That's the danger of averages because if people come to expect that you can supply it in a wet area like Kauaʻi, in an aid area that's an unrealistic number. We have to start to adjust our expectation, we can't apply the average across the board, it has to be contextual to the supply that we have and then your choice of agricultural production is going to have to relate to what's available. It’s not like the plantation days where you could move water from here to there, that's why all that plantation criteria is so anachronistic and dangerous because it still assumes that, but the only way that was possible was because of things we can't do now or don't do now. I appreciate the point about reservoirs, that's why if you want more water in an area you have to invest in infrastructure and that investment is generational and it's large. There's some public purpose served to it for fire suppression so we have to think about how we're going to invest in that. Really, if you wait for the landowner to do it who's got an agricultural crop, they're going to decommission every time. Our government has to work in partnership with private sector to really say, okay we're going to contribute a certain amount of this because it serves a public purpose. You get a real return for your investment and they’re going to balance.
I just wanted to add my two and a half cents here in this discussion. West Kauaʻi is deemed as the agricultural area of the island that the development plan focuses on and to have sustainable ag you need three things. You need soil, you need sunlight, and you need water, so generally you don't want it in a very rainy area and the use of 3,400 gallons per day per acre is really a function of where you're taking it, how you're using it, and how you're storing it. Reservoirs, at least for the 3,700 acres of coffee are key because we can take water, during the last several weeks we had a lot of rain coming through. We can store that water and save it for when there is no rain and if we can't do that or ag can't do that they'll have to start drilling water like in the Central Valley of California and we want to avoid that competing with potable water sources using it for ag. I think the balance here is that we need to have storage capacity, we need to be able to balance the high flows with the low flows. We just had a meeting of fire suppression with the county with the PMRF and with private landholders and what assets were available to help fight wildfires and water supply for. Reservoirs is one of the key factors there. I think all of this in your Water Use and Development Plan is key. One last comment, you made a reference to that the part of this plan is in the Water System Improvement Plan, I think the integration between surface water use, groundwater use would really help identify where you, the Department of Water would be doing its capital investing. That's my comments and I look forward to the plan when it's submitted to us for approval.
I am going to, Kaleo, challenge CWRM. This daily average 3,500, 2,500, it's going to be a lot. It's going to be very critical that if we're going to tailor something based upon location or types of crops that we have some kind of form because this has already come up and it will continue to come up. As we look at water allocation I think we need to have some kind of a mechanism to appropriately consider all of these factors in coming up with that formula because it does concern. There's a very big difference between 2,500 and 3,500 and I've got DOA saying 3,400.
The update that was a couple years ago that Department of Ag presented, they actually increased that number to like 5,600 gallons per acre per day, but what we've been working on and pushing back on and challenging our agencies to think about is critiquing that number and evaluating how we came up with that data. As Neal said, our IWREDSS model is a really useful tool and what we've been trying to do is make that front-facing so community applicants or agricultural practitioners can access that and play around with scenarios when they're doing their conservation planning. They're like, okay we're going to do drip irrigation or in certain areas going to do spray, we can get to a decent quantity sometimes beyond the 3,400 gallons per day based on crop type. We can present this back Commission on IWREDSS, it would be very enlightening for not only the public but this Commission to see what tools we do use and currently have available to us.
First of all, I want to thank everybody for the work that's gone into what's happened here and the discussion underway. I appreciate that Commissioner Katayama mentioned that this probably should be 2025 to 2045 as opposed to having the data start in 2015. Also want to appreciate Commissioner Hannah’s, his input on the reservoirs are significant and wanted for future use even if they aren't being used right now a lot. We are very conscious of the future, we could have changes. I will be meeting with the Department of Water next month to really drill down on some of the specifics that are of concern, but I want to comment that Moloaʻa, the information here is insufficient. There's a concentration of wells, I know even in one square mile area we have about 65 wells, many of which are being…Moloaʻa is a problematic area because we don't have county water really running through there and those wells are having a problem staying filled with water. The Kīlauea yield does not meet the demand. I want to highlight that the county has gone through great lengths to purchase 50 acres to put in some affordable housing program and we also did just get a special permit issued for a 7th through 12th high school, middle school right there across from the county housing in Kīlauea and both we don't see where we're going to have the water for it. We have a 1- million-gallon tank that we're hoping to put up in Kīlauea and I think if we have that it should help. I also want to just acknowledge the striking lack of reference to the Waiahi surface water treatment plant that feeds basically Līhuʻe, Puhi, Hanamāʻulu and that can range much further than that. My understanding it has the potential to reach all the way to Kalaheo to Keālia. These are the type of questions I want to figure out, how we get the Waiahi surface water treatment plant on there and then also I want to just ask I didn't see water reservations in there for the DHHL development plans that are underway. I might have missed it, I didn't see like in January we're going to be breaking ground in Hanapēpē and our service to our Hawaiian beneficiaries has been long overdue, so thank you so much. Those are my key points and I'm looking forward to working with the Department of Water coming up soon next month.
My name is Melania Kekaula and in reference to this, of course, I have a question, I have two actually. The first one is do we know whether the aquifer like the one on both sides of the island, in recent years have they remained the same as say maybe 40 years or what is the trend? Are they the same or have they decreased in amount of water because that's important to whatever we plan right now and going forward. The second question is I just love the presentation and the breakdown of water use, that was amazing, thank you. But I noticed that the agriculture was not included and I just wondered why? Thank you.
Normally we don't take questions, but if you'd like to answer them and if you can, would you like to answer that?
So far as the agricultural, we did that separately because we do have a lot more information on groundwater and the land use plans and policies, surface water, as we've gone over extensively here. There's a lack of available information on that. I'm sorry if that doesn’t answer your question, but we did do that separately with just that chart.
Okay, I hope that answers your question.
And then the second question was agriculture, did you?
Aloha mai kākou, Commissioners. For the record, my name is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer on this item, I'm here as a water consultant to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. A few observations from and reactions to the presentation. It was good that the consultants mentioned one well known and significant limitation to sustainable yield which is there's a gulf between sustainable yield and developable yield. If you're not aware, it didn't seem to be in the presentation. That's a very significant issue on Kauaʻi in particular where lots of wells are drilled and you just can't extract much water because of the density of the rock. I don't know what the gulf is between that but having that on the charts would probably be meaningful. I'll just highlight for you, the 2019 Water Use and Development Plan which updated sustainable yields for the state which is the numbers that are being used in this plan, this is reflective of Commissioner Hannah's comment, has an extensive discussion of we know that climate change is real, we know that rainfall is decreasing, and we're not taking into account new data in setting the sustainable yields. The sustainable yields that are reflected in this update aren't actually likely accurate whatsoever so should be aware of that. Adding another line of projected sustainable yields, the same kind of analysis you went through for Maui designation might be meaningful. Just in case it's not top of your mind, other limitations to sustainable yield include the assumption that wells are equally placed across the landscape, are all at the same depth, are pumping at the same rate, that geology is uniform throughout the aquifer, that there's laminar flow, that precipitation and recharge across the aquifer is the same which is of course not true anywhere in Hawaiʻi. There's a whole host of things but most importantly for groundwater dependent ecosystems where groundwater is flowing into the coast, there's no explicit accounting for that in the setting of sustainable yields. I think the biggest thing and this is the exact same methodology that was used for the Hawaii County Water Use and Development Plan sustainable yield, just because you're below sustainable yield does not equal you are sustainable. It is maybe a first run step of, okay we have a bunch of water here, maybe we're okay at providing for some future extractive uses but the analysis is not there to determine whether or not public trust uses including DHHL’s uses. I want to acknowledge the department did reach out, asked for a meeting with one staff member at the department. We did not know, however about the 2023 meetings and I'm aware that many of our beneficiaries did not know about the 2023 meetings. Looking on the website, there are meeting notes from those meetings but there's no attendance numbers so I just have no sense of how many people came. My concern and it's a concern for the success of this plan is that if this now goes to public hearing, there were five meetings in 2015 and five meetings in 2023 which may have not been well attended, if this now goes to public hearing for approval, the level of engagement and dialogue and improvement might be more frustrating than productive, absent additional public outreach. I only just saw that on November the draft plan was posted to the website at the end of November. We haven't reviewed it so don't have any specific comments.
Let me follow up with Amanda since you acknowledge the delta between sustainable yield and developable yield, is that a data point that you could put on to the maps?
No, I'm not sure how we'd um come up with that line.
Maybe some theoretical discussion of it and how it could play a big role in how you think about utilization of resource. Use a case study, use an example here since you don't have data to apply it across the board. At least where you do have some knowledge, use that as an indicator of what the impact could be.
We can take a look at that or see if there's any way to indicate even though these lines show full buildout is below it, that this these areas are getting close. Maybe those warrant a closer look and more in-depth analysis on a future update.
Raise the issue, don't be silent on the issue. Raise it so people can know it's there.
CWRM is to hold public hearings, Kaleo. I know there are three hydrologic units, do you have a strategy on how you're going to hold these public meetings?
This is specific for the Kauaʻi Water Use and Development Plan, so usually we just conduct one public hearing related to this and during COVID we've done most of them via Zoom. We can do it on island we'll coordinate to see what works best for Kauaʻi DWS and the community. We could hold more than one to provide opportunities, it just becomes a cost and resourcing issue but that is the next step in this process is to take this out for even more public information and receive comments on the draft plan.
I do want to take Jonathan's comment, I don't want to take that lightly. I would rather have the community talk about this than when the matter comes back to CWRM for decision making, the community saying we never heard about this. Maybe there's a possibility of coordinating with some of the homestead associations to have meetings in some of these communities there that are being impacted or even just calling a meeting with all the homestead associations on Kauaʻi. That might be a really good opportunity to get good input. We have our own kuleana, we have to do a public meeting but that is not to preclude the Water Department from convening more public meetings. It is in your best interest to meet with as many people before it comes back to us where I think we prefer not to have, legitimate controversy yes, but if it's people that haven't heard, it's better that and I think we've already heard from some people that there's not enough…
Getting back to developable yield since you can't get that number, you might use some of the numbers that we use which is 70%, 80%, 90% where you start to worry about reaching the developable yield even though the sustainable yield side I think what you said right now. Even though you can't call it the developable yield, you can see a warning sign something like that on the graph.
