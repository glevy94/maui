went through for all the different factors that were presented in Chapter 2. So moving on to Chapter 3, as mentioned, this content is focused on understanding both the existing as well as the future water demand and supply and understanding how that essentially impacts the water source availability for the district.

As I'm sure the commission knows, East Honolulu area encompasses two different groundwater aquifer system areas, the Wai'alae West and Wai'alae East, which combined have a relatively low sustainable yield at 4.5 million gallons per day.

Historically, over the last about 30 years, the district has used more water per capita than the islandwide average. For example, in 2010, East Honolulu residents, on average, used about 194 gallons per water per person per day, which is about 25 percent higher than the islandwide average. So in total, and this map is showing the Board of Water Supply transfers based on 2013 to 2017 averages, the district used an average of about 8.38 million gallons per day of Board of Water Supply water, with the majority of that water being supplied by transfers from the Honolulu sources, and a smaller amount of that being supplied by transfers from Windward in addition to in-district pumping, which accounts for about 16 percent of the Board of Water.
