Unfortunately, I don't know what the current status of it is, but was somehow getting the ability of the users, that includes the public, to run certain things on groundwater models because that's really what I think the value of the groundwater model would be. So you could say, Okay, I'm gonna put wells in here and here and here, put it on Nyx, say, and I think they have explored things like web-based -- you know, a web-based tool that does that. And then, because groundwater models take a while to run -- and that's gonna change because things are gonna get faster and faster and faster. But anyway, because groundwater models take a while to run back then when they were trying these things, they would have the -- my understanding is that they would have the results ready for you at a certain time, and then they would send you a text and say, Okay, here's your results. So, you know, maybe it might take a couple days for the groundwater model to run that scenario. But anyway, scenario testing should, I think -- I would -- just looking into the future, it's probably -- and it might not happen in my career, but I would think that that would be something that could be done.
