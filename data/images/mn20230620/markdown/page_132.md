COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: And I studied forestry, and I'm thinking like, Well, I need to understand more, you know, about law. But I really appreciate what I've been able to learn certainly (inaudible) especially working more closely (inaudible).

Your comments about interactions, some of those exchangers were really where we could not be so reactive in a meeting, but really think hard and think creatively and think around some really complex issues and, yeah, mahalo for those points. I haven't been in a contested case really yet, so I'll be thinking about that.

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Don't worry, you'll get a chance.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: (Inaudible.) Yeah, so -- yeah, mahalo for that. And we'll see you around --

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Oh, yeah.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: -- in educational spheres.

CHAIR CHANG: There you go.

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Yeah. Hey, for our legal assistant, you know, we do have a mediation process that's in our rules, but the commissioners are not allowed to participate. It's an outside person, and we still are not connected to that, so maybe there's something you can look at.

CHAIR CHANG: Yeah, we are looking.
