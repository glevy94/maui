Personally, I just want to \\nsay I didnt know his name is Marvin, Ive known him for 20 years and never thought Id see any \\nof us doing the kind of work we are doing today.  Im proud of him as an individual.  On behalf \\nof my organization, I think Kaleo has opened an ear to the folks in the community to talk about \\nthe significance in water to the culture and the ecosystems, the healthy streams and nearshore \\nenvironment.  Mahalo. \\n \\nMs. Leimana DaMate, Aha Moku:  We stand on our written testimony: \\n \\na list of the Pae ina so you have a better idea of the scope of the Water \\nCommission and their responsibility to native Hawaiian communities on the eight \\nislands \\n \\nthe Association of Hawaiian Civic Clubs (AHCC), at its annual convention in \\nSeattle, Washington in November 2022 adopted Resolution No. 2022-AA \\nUrging the Incoming Administration to keep Kaleo Manuel in his current \\nposition as Deputy Director of the Commission on Water Resource \\nManagement \\n \\nin regards to the Ota Well issue in Keauhou, Kona, Kaleo Manuel personally and \\nwith his staff, met with kupuna and lawaia (fishing practitioners) of Kailua-\\nKona and the West Hawaii coastline as well as with Aha Moku generational \\nohana of the Keauhou Aquifer and communities of the Public Trust to assist in \\nthe mitigation of water withdrawal requests from the Keauhou Aquifer and its \\nimpact on traditional ocean practices under the direction of Kaleo Manuel, \\nCWRM employs the Kapaakai Analysis to all CWRM applications that deal \\nwith water use permitting in the State of Hawaii. \\nAha Moku strongly supports Kaleo Manuel as the Deputy Director, Commission on Water \\nResource Management. \\n \\nMr. Wayne Chung Tanaka:  On behalf of The Sierra Club of Hawaii, we strongly support the \\nappointment of Deputy Marvin Kaleo Manuel to continue his vital role as the Water Commission \\nDeputy.  Over the past four years, Mr. Manuel has demonstrated a high level of diligence, \\ncommitment, and objective solution-seeking in his oversight of the administration and \\nimplementation of the State Water Code and the public trust doctrine.  Under his leadership, the \\nWater Commission and its staff have been able to successfully realize the prudent planning and \\nprotective mechanisms envisioned in our State Water Code including: \\n \\nupdated instream flow standards for streams throughout East Maui  \\n \\nwater management designation for West Maui \\n \\nupdated interim instream flow standard for Heeia stream, Oahu \\n \\nupdated interim instream flow standard for Waioli stream, Kauai  \\nFor these reasons, the Sierra Club of Hawaii respectfully but strongly urges the Commission to \\napprove the appointment and retention of Marvin Kaleo Manuel as the Deputy Director of \\nCWRM. \\n \\n \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n4 \\n \\nMs. Karyn Kanekoa:  Im from Maui and I live in Honokhau Valley in the moku of Kanapali.  \\nIm testifying in strong support of the appointment of Kaleo Manuel as First Deputy to the \\nChairperson of the Commission on Water Resource Management.  Kaleo has invested and \\ncommitted to responsibly and proactively caring for not only the kumu wai of our pae ina but \\nalso our kaiulu and lhui who depend on our water resources.  As an ohana who relies on the \\nwai and cares for our natural resources, we respect and appreciate and mahalo Kaleo for always \\nbeing transparent and pono and for genuinely listening to our concerns and for putting our natural \\nresource first.  Mahalo nui.  Without wai we are nothing.  We know this job requires a special and \\nskilled individual, someone who has the knowledge and ability to work effectively and fairly with \\nthis community, always putting our natural resources and those who rely on them first and \\nforemost.  In my opinion, Kaleo does all of this and much more.  Mahalo nui. \\n \\n \\nMr. Isaac Moriwake, Earthjustice:  Good afternoon, Chair Chang and members of the \\nCommission, Happy New Year everybody.  Nice seeing you and heres to a good 2023.  Ill keep \\nit short since we all know Kaleo needs to get back to work.  You dont need any encouragement \\nor reminder of how he is objectively truly the best choice for this job.  All these supporters and \\nwell-wishers, we see how Kaleo as Deputy of the Commission has stepped up its commitment \\nand its progress in fulfilling its public trust kuleana.  Of course, credit should go to the \\nCommissioners themselves and all the Commissions dedicated and hard-working staff, but today \\nis Kaleos day.  As a decades long advocate for the public trust and an admirer of true public \\nservants, Im glad that the Commission is keeping the band together here with Kaleo continuing \\nunder the new administration.  Hes worked hard over the years to grow into this role and we all \\nneed him to help lead the Commission in following through on the hard work ahead.  Mahalo \\nKaleo and mahalo Commissioners for voting to confirm.  Mahalo. \\n \\n \\nDr. Kamanamaikalani Beamer:  Aloha mai everyone.  Im a former eight-year, two-term Water \\nCommissioner and served to the best of my ability with many of you here in this room and a \\npleasure to meet you Chair and appreciate the work that everyone is doing in this capacity.  Im \\nhere to strongly support with the utmost confidence the appointment of Kaleo to continue as \\nDeputy.  I think its critical to continue the momentum that he has been able to achieve.  Kaleo is \\none of the best facilitators Ive known.  As we all know a positive and important role of this \\nCommission is to have a diversity of opinions and interests and Kaleo does a fantastic job \\nfacilitating all of that.  I can go over numerous cases and decisions where I felt his leadership was \\npivotal.  To be honest, the last day of my term on the Commission when we released the N Wai \\nEh decision, Kaleo and I were on the phone multiple times.  I think some of us remember there \\nwere some challenges or errors in that final Decision and Order and Kaleo was just on it through \\nthe whole process.  I just want to firmly give my support for his leadership and I want to thank \\nyour administration for continuing and seeing his service and where it can take us and water in \\nthe future for Hawaii.  Happy to take any questions. \\n \\n \\nMs. Kapua Sproat:  Aloha Chair Chang and Commissioners.  Im testifying today in strong \\nsupport of agenda item B1.  Like many of you, I wear lots of different hats in our community and \\nin that capacity, I have had the great privilege of working closely with Deputy Director Manuel \\non several issues impacting many different islands across our pae ina, but today I am here in my \\npersonal capacity.  I have been fortunate to have been appearing before this Commission since the \\n1990s.  Yes, I am that old.  I was trying to recall how many Deputies I had worked with over the \\nyears from Linnel Nishioka, and Yvonne Izu, to Ken Kawahara and more recently Jeff Pearson \\nand then Kaleo.  For me, Kaleo stands out as the very best for all the reasons you have already \\nseen detailed in the voluminous written testimony as well as the people who have already \\nappeared today.  My voice joins the chorus of others who are deeply grateful that you, Chair \\nChang, have nominated Deputy Director Manuel to continue the important work of this \\nCommission.  Like Wayne Tanaka, I was also at the meeting four years ago supporting Deputy \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n5 \\n \\nDirector Manuels first term and Im excited to be back here again to support him continuing and \\nas someone who tracks water issues closely.  I really scrutinized his work over the last four years \\nand have been impressed not simply with his grasp of the issues but by his integrity and aloha and \\nhow as a process person he brings so much to this Commission - I think as Commissioner Beamer \\npointed out.  Youve already heard a lot from folks and as Isaac said we need him to get back to \\nwork.  I just have a couple of things Id like to highlight.  In his first term he implemented some \\nimportant changes.  I think having issues presented for discussion at one commission meeting and \\nthen decision-making at a second meeting has really helped the Commission and all affected \\nstakeholders be able to engage in meaningful discussions without the fear of a contested case \\nhearing hanging over everything.  I also got to work closely with him on several issues.  One \\nexample is our Native Hawaiian and environmental rights clinic supported the Waioli Valley \\ntaro hui with challenges to restore their loi kalo and mnowai.  This was incredibly important \\nwork and incredibly complicated work and you folks know we were working side by side.  I \\ncannot say enough about how important Kaleos role was as a facilitator to bring together all the \\ndifferent entities, not just with Commission staff, Ayron and others, but also folks throughout \\nDLNR and that was crucial in helping us leverage resources and to make meaningful changes not \\njust with what happened before this Commission but also from a larger policy perspective so that \\nother kalo farmers dont have to have these issues.  Others have also mentioned what an \\nimportant bridge hes been and now we can have meaningful two-way discussions not just one-\\nway directives.  Kaleo has also had the courage to uphold the law and the Commissions processes \\nand that has garnered some grousing, but I think as an attorney, I think that better protects this \\nCommission and has reduced the number of appeals that weve seen during his term, at least \\ncompared to others.  I can go on and on but suffice it to say I think you see I strongly support his \\nreappointment and I want to urge all of you folks to vote in support.  Thank you so much and Im \\nhappy to take any questions. \\n \\n \\nMs. Vicky Holt Takamine, Kumu Hula, PA'I Foundation:  I have had the privilege of meeting \\nKaleo as a young undergraduate at the University of Hawaii and throughout his graduate studies \\nat UH Mnoa.  He took several of my classes and he also joined halau.  Ive never been so proud \\nof him over the past four years and watching him grow under DHHL.  He led our PA'I board \\nthrough an amazing planning process to develop our PA'I strategic plan and watching him \\nfacilitate those meetings and watching him in the community, I know that he has done such \\namazing work in the last four years with his team here.  I thank the team here, his staff for the \\nsupport that they give to Kaleo because a leader can only lead if you have people, and you have \\nstaff that strongly support the vision.  The fact that hes holding us all responsible not just the \\npeople at the Commission, but to the laws that were put into place to preserve our natural and \\ncultural resources, and water is our most valuable resource.  I know that he takes this very \\nseriously and his kuleana to support and abide by and hold up the Water Commission standards \\nand the laws of our ina is going to be something that he takes very seriously, and he also knows \\nthat he must answer to his kumu.  Thank you very much, I have such strong support for Kaleo.  I \\nhave gotten to know him, and he is just going to be super for you. \\n \\n \\n \\nMs. Kanoelani Steward:  Aloha I come from Lahaina, Maui.  I am just testifying in strong support \\nof Kaleo Manuel to be reappointed to his position as Deputy.  Strong kkoo to all of the \\nCommissioners of CWRM.  We saw him in Lahaina quite a few times especially the past year.  I \\nthink last spring was when he came out to facilitate a public meeting with all of us.  I just really \\nwant to commend the awesome work that he did navigating the crowd that we had.  He was \\ninforming us about the water designation in Lahaina and not pushing any kind of agenda on us \\nbut just showing reasons why designation was important and how it could only support the future \\nof Lahaina and how it can help our community as well.  Just wanted to quickly testify and show \\nmy kkoo as a community member of Lahaina for Kaleo Manuel. \\n \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n6 \\n \\n \\nMs. JoAnne Kaona:  Im the secretary for the Waioli Valley Taro Hui.  Four generations of kalo \\nfarmers of Hawaii, our organization works in partnership with you and your staff, including \\nKaleo to amend the IIFS for Waioli Stream in Spring 2021.  Our testimony today is in strong \\nsupport of agenda item B1 and Im here on behalf of our hui of farmers to support Kaleo because \\nhe has supported us after a very long road starting with the 2018 flood.  There were tons of \\napplications, exemptions, studies, consultations, time at the Legislature and potential easements.  \\nLast year, Chair Case confirmed that we are pau with the water leasing process and can focus all \\nof our efforts back to restoring our farm and we have life in Waioli Valley.  It took four years but \\nit felt like a lifetime and we never would have gotten here without the help and support of Kaleo \\nand Ayron.  Im not just talking about the IIFS.  Kaleo was an important liaison with the Land \\nDivision and DLNR more generally.  He was a bridge to ensure clear and transparent \\ncommunication, a process that was completely confusing for us as kalo farmers.  He even came to \\nWaioli to see firsthand the waters and other resources we were talking about and together with \\nAyron, was key regarding the installation of our gage so we can better monitor both streamflow \\nand water use in our auwais.  This is a wonderful example of agency and community working \\ntogether and this is just one example.  Im sure there are many more across Hawaii so please \\nvote to confirm him. \\n \\n \\nMr. Erik Meade:  Im a Law Student at the William S. Richardson School of Law and given the \\noverwhelming and powerful support already provided, Ill keep this really short.  Im in strong \\nsupport of B1 and I will stand on my written testimony.  Also wanted to thank Kaleo and the \\nCommission for the ability to testify via Zoom, which makes access to these meetings and \\ninformation much more open to people who usually have to travel to Honolulu. \\n \\n \\nMr. Holden Kalamaehu Takahashi:  Aloha mai everybody.  Im here to testify in support of the \\nreappointment of Deputy Director Manuel and just wanted to say we have had a lot of positive \\nand very respectful lkahi and engagement with Deputy Director Manuel.  The Honokhau \\nValley residents had the opportunity to hike up the valley to see the state of wai as we were \\nrenegotiating the IIFS and beginning the conversations in terms of the designation of West Maui.  \\nI think it speaks volumes when you have somebody in the Deputy Directors position to come and \\nwalk with the community in their place to sort of really see what the historical impacts are and \\nwhat other things like developments and other interests have on the ina and on these resources.  \\nI would like to see at least one more term from a fellow kanaka and somebody who is truly \\ndedicated to this resource, to our community, to our ohana and hopefully his work and the work \\nthat we can do together as a lhui will benefit the little ones like this and hopefully Deputy \\nDirector Manuel, if my boy here needs a job, I hope you can give him one.  Mahalo.  And I say \\nthis in full trust that you will do your best to mlama your kuleana to this next term to ensure the \\nsecurity and integrity of wai for all of us.  Mahalo nui. \\n \\n \\nMr. Kekai Keahi:  I want to support the picking of Kaleo for the position.  I met him way back \\nbefore he worked for the State, and he has always been honest and truthful which is in my \\nexperience somewhat rare in government these days.  And even when its things I dont want to \\nhear, he tells it to me.  I just want to say I support Kaleo and I hope you folks pick him.  Thank \\nyou. \\n \\n \\nMr. Jonathan Likeke Scheuer:  Aloha mai kkou.  I often appear before you on behalf of various \\nentities, but I am here today solely on my own behalf.  Like Professor Sproat and Mr. Moriwake, \\nIm part of the folks who have been here for three decades.  Not only was I here when Kaleo was \\nlast appointed, I was also here when the previous Deputy was appointed and the previous Deputy \\nand at one point I was in that seat and the person before that.  The thing I wanted to share other \\nthan to echo the long support that weve heard today for Kaleo is how different it is with respect \\nto those who have come before Commissioners and Deputies. This has been a body that has been \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n7 \\n \\ndeeply hostile to local communities and Hawaiian communities.  You have all these voices \\ncoming from across the pipeline saying hey, they recognize what you do, and we support what \\nyou do, we dont always agree with what you do but we have a connection now.  Not everybody \\nhas been happy during Kaleos time, but I think thats also because its not that conflict didnt \\nexist before, but it was suppressed.  Voices were suppressed, issues were suppressed, and we \\nknow what happens when that happens for too long.  Bringing up a process where many entities \\nnow feel at least they have the opportunity to come before this really important board and have a \\nfair hearing, will make our lives and Hawaii so much better.  Mahalo nui. \\n \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  I would like to just say mahalo to all of those who have provided written and \\noral testimony.  It is very clear as Mr. Scheuer very aptly stated, things have changed, and it is \\nnice to see these voices at the table.  I appreciated reading through all the testimonies as they \\nwere individualized based upon a personal experience and I think that really matters.  I appreciate \\neveryone who took the time to submit testimony for our consideration, so thank you again. \\n \\nMOTION: (BUCK/HANNAHS) \\nTo approve B-1 as submitted. \\n \\n \\nDISCUSSION \\n \\n \\nCommissioner Buck:  I was so happy to hear that Kaleo was coming back.  Incoming Chair if you \\nhad anything to do with that it was a very wise move.  Im so happy for the Water Commission \\nbecause Kaleo has done an unbelievable job in managing the Water Commission.  I am so happy \\nfor the State of Hawaii.  Weve heard a lot of descriptions of the last four years, weve had an \\nopportunity, maybe for the first time to really implement the Water Code over large regional \\nareas.  I am so happy for the State of Hawaii that Kaleo is back.  Finally, I am so happy for \\nKaleo himself.  He is a unique individual with knowledge, skills and abilities and he has an \\nopportunity to be in a position, which he has demonstrated, over the next four years to make a \\npositive impact and those are experiences and memories that he will always cherish.  I am \\nincredibly happy for Kaleo and I am 100% in support of his reappointment. \\n \\n \\nCommissioner Hannahs:  Fist of all, I want to thank the testifiers who came forward, took time \\nfrom your day to be here and be a part of the process and for all that you shared largely in support \\nof Kaleo.  I acknowledge the testimony of Charley Ice in opposition and appreciate Charleys \\ncourage and status and stepping forward and stating his views.  Weve heard certainly a strong \\nsupport from our Hawaiian community and grass roots of our supporters, of our culture and our \\nenvironment.  I also appreciated the testimony of Mike Atherton as a developer who is trying to \\nrestore agriculture and other uses in a balanced way, and I think that his testimony was key and \\nan important element of support for your continuation in this position. When Kaleo first came \\ninto this position, I met with him in his office and we talk about this all the time, I saw this \\nnumber on the whiteboard and it was the number of meetings he would have in his term of this \\nCommission and a recognition that every one that passed without productive outcome was a lost \\nopportunity.  That is a profoundly important attribute of a public servant who is trying to work \\nespecially in this area where so much needs to be done for such a vital resource.  That attitude \\nwas telltale, and it is one thing to want to get the work done and it is another thing to get the work \\ndone.  The unprecedented results that weve seen in your submittal, Chair, as well as in other \\ntestimony, I think testifies to the fact that its not only a matter of wishing things can happen but \\nan ability to make things happen.  So appreciate that and I love Kevins comment that we \\nprovided an ear to people who didnt feel like they had one before and weve provided \\nopportunities to really kind of work out the differences so that we have a framework for how to \\nmove forward not only to protect the resource, not only to perpetuate the culture, but also to \\nprovide for development of agricultural and other urban uses in a way thats very compatible with \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n8 \\n \\nthose goals and outcomes.  Thats balance and I think its an important duty of this Commission.  \\nI think the team, not only Kaleo, but this team is doing a remarkable job in achieving that.  I \\nrecognize that as a new administration steps in, theres a desire to eagerly bring your team in and \\nI appreciate that Governor Green has recognized that some members of the team that came before \\nwere really, valuable attributes and deserve recognition for what theyve done in the past and are \\ngoing to be valuable in his administration going forward in continuing progress and achieving \\ngreater results.  For these reasons, Ive seconded the motion and eagerly await not only the \\napproval of this motion but also the months ahead.  I think I have about a year and a half while \\nwe continue to work with the work weve done.  Mahalo. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  Its with great relief that I heard Deputy Manuel was going to \\nbe reappointed.  Im the newest person on the Commission and it was a very eye-opening \\nexperience to realize how much of the work of this Commission really happens between the \\nmeetings.  The Deputy and staff working together to really organize information and provide it to \\nus so that we can make informed decisions.  As testifier Kapua Sproat pointed out, the \\ninformational briefs that precede decision-making have been really helpful.  The submittals are \\nsuper dense so its helpful to have that lead time to wrap our brains around these complicated \\nissues.  Ive had the opportunity to get out to East Maui to walk and really see the area that we are \\nmaking decisions on.  We cant always go out there, its hard logistically with Sunshine Laws but \\nit was facilitated by Deputy and staff.  Ive seen him and a lot of his staff take lead on different \\nissues, Ayron Strauch on streams, Ryan Imata on Red Hill and really take the long view on many \\nthings.  Weve had conversations on capacity building, we all know that CWRM doesnt have \\nenough staff and wanting to do all that it should and wants to do, so how do we take the long \\nview?  Thats somebody not looking at a four-year term but really with a long-term kind of \\nintergenerational interest in mind.  Alongside with that weve had conversations about climate \\nchange, how do we better think about climate change in the context of our decision making and \\nthat played into the Lahaina Water Management Area Designation.  Im relieved that we can \\ncontinue the work because these are challenging.  As people have noted his facilitation skills are \\nimpressive and humbling.  I dont know how to learn those skills or how to create more people \\nwho have those skills who can really leverage them in public service.  Its not easy to be an agent \\nof the State especially working in community where theres been so much distress.  I really \\nrespect the rapport hes built especially as I was on the Red Hill permitted interaction group, Ive \\nseen what happens when we break trust with institutions and how harmful that is when really \\ntaking care of our waters.  I appreciate the stamina that you bring, and you will find in the coming \\nyears.  Im looking forward and I fully support your nomination.  Im looking forward to \\ncontinuing the important and complicated work ahead. \\n \\n \\nCommissioner Katayama:  I think Kaleos accomplishments over his tenure as Deputy have been \\nwell documented and described by oral testimony as well as written testimony.  I think this is an \\ninteresting and unique situation, could you provide some historical perspective?  My first \\nquestion is, I dont think any agency in the State other than the Water Commission has a Deputy \\nand Chair to be confirmed by two different bodies.  How does the relationship work with the \\nChair being temporary and the Department Deputy being confirmed; should that not run in \\ntandem?  But lets put that aside for a moment, I think its a very powerful situation that we have \\na resident Deputy thats being nominated again and in reference to Mr. Ices testimony, has that \\nbeen vetted to see if the internal mechanisms of the department have been working as intended?  I \\ndont know if that was ever articulated in the narrative that was presented as well as the resume.  \\nAll the big stuff for the future I agree with because I was there for most of it.  But we do have a \\nfiduciary responsibility to mandate things that we need to interface with the public in terms of \\nwell permits or other kinds of administrative things.  I was wondering, has that been vetted?  \\nThats sort of my big areas - do we need to talk about it a little more? \\n \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n9 \\n \\n \\nDeputy Manuel:  Aloha Commissioner Katayama, mahalo for the question.  First of all, I want to \\nsay mahalo to the community for support of my nomination as well as the Commissioners and \\nstaff that are here.  I think the question is tied to that in terms of internal management and staff \\nmanagement and resources.  I know what it is like to come in as staff as I used to work for the \\nDepartment of Hawaiian Home Lands as staff and the change in administration every four years \\nand sometimes shorter if they dont last, so continuity is really important.  I will say in my \\ndefense, Ive always come in working within the systems that have been created, but constantly \\nasking questions about efficiency.  How can we do things smarter with less resources, take \\nadvantage of opportunities when we see them?  A lot of the internal dialogues that we have with \\nstaff, hopefully eventually some of them will talk with you one on one, or the freedom to do that, \\nand I encourage staff to share their thoughts with me.  Weve constantly had great conversations, \\nwe dont always agree but Im always willing to listen to staff and look at ways that we can \\nimprove our systems.  Some of the criticisms in Mr. Ices letter I was unaware of.  I process \\npermits, well construction and pump installation permits, as they are presented to me and I take \\nevery signature I put on a piece of paper very, very seriously.  Most of my staff can attest to that \\nas they probably get things sent back to them if there is even just a typo because I want it to be as \\nperfect as it can be.  Thats the type of person I am.  The commitment to quality, that Im \\ncommitted to.  Ive worked with a supervisor and the supervisor would work with me, so we \\nwork through some of the issues especially related to well construction/pump installation permits \\nthat weve reviewed.  Again, my commitment is just to be as good as I can, be an open door for \\nstaff to work with.  As my kumu talked about in her running her halau, you as a leader are only as \\ngood as your team.  I believe in every single one of my team members and the staff that are here \\ntoday because I cannot lead without them.  They really support me and I actually support them, \\nIve uplifted them and a lot of the credit that has been given to me is actually credit that should be \\ngiven to them because a lot of the initiatives and work thats been presented, theyve been worked \\non but have never gotten to the agenda or have never been prioritized.  Thats my response to \\nCommissioner Katayamas question about a review and analyses of time frames.  We were in the \\nmiddle of a pandemic, I just want to highlight that. I got caught with that one so a lot of the time \\nfor review and processing were not only potentially stalled because of the pandemic, staff had \\nretired, other agencies that have to do reviews for example, the Department of Health and State \\nHistoric Preservation Division (SHPD) also established new processes that we had to work \\nthrough and navigate through.  While some of the numbers may not line up, I do have data and \\nstatistics on permits processed, etc. through my four years.  I think a lot of it was just situation \\nbased and timing. \\n \\n \\nCommissioner Katayama:  Thank you Kaleo.  I guess in going through this process, I believe my \\nfiduciary responsibility is to cover all the bases.  All the testimony in support was well deserved. \\n \\nDeputy Manuel:  Mahalo and I appreciate the question and hopefully item C2 will also highlight \\nsome of the limits of our resources and the budget and staff that we do have. \\n \\n \\nCommissioner Meyer:  I do have a concern and the concern really is that over many years, I \\nworked on a lot of different teams and a lot of corporate and governmental positions and its \\nabsolutely critical for the effectiveness for the organizations to have the boss and the assistants to \\nthe boss and the Director, Deputy Directors or Deputies to be of one mind and be pulling in the \\nsame direction and that usually implies that folks have worked together for some time and \\ntheyve had adequate time and effort devoted to conforming their goals and objectives for the \\norganization and the mission.  This is a situation where it appears to me, that we havent had that \\ntime, unfortunately and thats the nature of the beast perhaps but we dont even know for \\nexample, if the Chairs position is final, if thats correct.  Im concerned about that and this is \\nsomething that should be discussed in executive session, but thats a concern because the Chair \\nand the Deputy should be able to finish each others sentences.  They should have complete \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n10 \\n \\nagreement, they should really conform the concepts of goals and directions and in a small \\norganization, a relatively small organization like the Commission, that is a big task and shortfalls \\nand budget and in staffing, thats something that is critical.  Its critical to achieving the correct \\nobjectives for the people of Hawaii to filling our obligations under the Water Code and Im just \\nconcerned that we havent had the time for that conformance and unity of goals and missions and \\nthoughts to take place.  I hope it doesnt appear that there are difference of opinion or things dont \\nget done as efficiently as possible because that would be unfortunate and again, this is something \\nthat we should have talked about in executive session.  I really think that we need to make use of \\nthat vehicle more often in situations like this.  I admire Kaleo, I admire his work and he certainly \\nhas a lot of energy and I appreciate and admire that.  Thank you very much. \\n \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Ive only been sitting as Commissioner for 18 months and in that time, Ive \\nworked with Kaleo, I must say he has a lot of energy and positive energy.  He is committed to the \\nmission of the Commission and that is to protect and sustain our resources and our precious \\nwater, which I am also committed to.  We have some disagreements, weve talked about them, \\nand we will continue to work towards the betterment of our State.  I am pleased that he has been \\nnominated and fully support his nomination. \\n \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  Thank you very much, Kathy, appreciate the comments.  I just have a few \\ncomments.  I appreciated both Mr. Katayamas and Mr. Meyers comments.  This is a historic \\nmoment for us, one that the Governor has had confidence in nominating me as the first Native \\nHawaiian woman, with a team with Laura Kaakua as the First Deputy and Kaleo Manuel as the \\nDeputy for the Water Commission.  I think it is a statement about the Governors commitment \\nand his recognition of sensitivity to the Hawaiian community and that we do bring that to a \\ndepartment that touches and concerns every single person, whether you live here or whether you \\nvisit, but most particularly Native Hawaiians.  You will find that I am a process person and there \\nare people that are far smarter than me on substance, but I am a process person who believes in \\nproviding a safe venue and platform for genuine community engagement.  I have appreciated the \\ngood work of Kaleo, as articulated by many of you who have provided testimony.  Sometimes the \\npendulum swings a bit, and the pendulum has swung a bit where we are creating a platform for \\nvoices that historically have not been heard and it is those people who have probably been most \\naffected by the decisions of the Water Commission and other agencies.  Both in DLNR and at the \\nWater Commission, it is my intention to create a space for those good conversations.  I intend to \\nuse the Board of Land & Natural Resources as well as the Water Commission as a vehicle to hear \\ncommunity voices and concerns.  We may not all have the same decision, but we are going to try \\nvery hard to create a place for those voices to be heard.  Our first duty is to the mission of the \\nWater Code.  Were not here to necessarily advocate, but it is to ensure that the Code is being \\nupheld not only in the letter of the law but the spirit of the law.  What was it intended to do with \\nrespect to my style of management.  I say I am much too makule, too old, to micromanage but it \\nis to provide the team, the staff with the tools for them to be successful whether its resources, \\ncapacity or funding but it is also to provide good input as we all make informed decisions.  We \\nare going to do a lot of internal coordination.  To Mr. Meyers & Mr. Katayamas comments, \\nwere going to speak very candidly within these walls, all the divisions will speak, and we have \\nnumerous divisions that dont necessarily have the same mission, but when we leave DLNR we \\nbetter have one voice but that means that were going to have a lot of hard discussions internally.  \\nNot everybody agrees with me, and I dont agree with everybody, but we are going to create an \\nenvironment where people can feel like they have the ability to say what they have to say and \\nyoure right, I am not confirmed.  I am here, I am the interim appointee, subject to Senate \\nconfirmation and I dont know how thats all going to go but during the time that I have here I am \\ngoing to make the most of my time here sitting on both the Water Commission and DLNR.  And \\nlike Kaleo, we come from similar values, and we share similar experiences and I think visions for \\nthe implementation of the Water Code.  We may not all agree on how we get there but I think we \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n11 \\n \\nwant to get to the right place.  I am optimistic that with the Water Commission as a collective \\nbody and the good guidance by staff, we will be able to continue the good work thats already \\nbeen instituted by the previous Commissioners and the Chairperson.  I know that I have big shoes \\nto fill with Suzanne Case but I will do the best that I can.  I am extremely grateful that Kaleo has \\ncome back to return, that is the Governors decision to reappoint Kaleo but I think he has already \\nheard a lot of the people in the community.  Mahalo.  Im going to call for the motion that has \\nbeen made by Commissioner Buck and seconded by Commissioner Hannahs, to approve the \\nrecommendation by the Chairperson to appoint Kaleo Manuel as the Deputy Director of the \\nWater Commission, all in favor please say aye.  Lets take a roll call vote for this one to make \\nsure we get it on the record, a unanimous vote.  Ms. Yoda will you please do a roll call vote? \\n \\n \\nMs. Yoda took a roll call vote: \\n \\n \\nMichael Buck:  \\n \\nAye \\n \\n \\nNeil Hannahs:  \\n \\nAye \\n \\n \\nAurora Kagawa-Viviani: \\nAye \\n \\n \\nWayne Katayama: \\n \\nAye \\n \\n \\nPaul Meyer: \\n \\n \\nAye \\n \\n \\nKathy Ho: \\n \\n \\nAye \\n \\n \\nChairperson Chang: \\n \\nAye \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  The motion has been made, seconded, and unanimously approved.  \\nCongratulations!  Mahalo to all of those who are here today and those on Zoom and Kaleo for \\nyour willingness to serve another four years. \\n \\n \\nKaleo Manuel:  Mahalo.  My white board is empty so I can put that number on the white board.  I \\nappreciate the confidence and again, thank you and mahalo for the support from the community \\nthat are here and online as well as staff, mahalo for all that you do and I look forward to another \\nfour years. \\n \\n012423 01:17:10 \\n \\nC.  \\nNON-ACTION ITEMS / INFORMATIONAL BRIEFINGS  \\n \\n1.  \\nDepartment of Health Update on Red Hill Response and Remediation  \\n \\nCommissioner Ho asked Ms. Joanna Seto, DOH Environmental Management Division Chief, to \\nintroduce the Department of Health team. \\n \\n \\nMs. Seto stated that the DOH will give a brief update of the situation at Red Hill and introduced \\nthe DOH team: \\n \\nAFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam) HEER Incident Case No. 20221129-1438: \\nMs. Liz Galvez \\n \\nPFAS Environmental Action Levels:  Mr. Roger Brewer \\n \\nDOH Emergency Order:  Ms. Kelly Ann Lee and Commissioner Kathy Ho \\n \\nAquifer Monitoring and Recovery:  Ms. Fenix Grange \\n \\n \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n12 \\n \\nRed Hill Shaft Filtration and Discharge into Halawa Stream:  Ms. Joanna Seto \\n \\n \\nRECESS: \\n \\n3:20 pm \\nRECONVENE:  \\n3:25 pm \\n \\n \\n \\nMs. Seto introduced Liz Galvez, HEER (Hazard Evaluation & Emergency Response)   \\n \\n \\nMs. Galvez:  I have been asked to present current information for the AFFF incident.  On \\nNovember 29, 2022, at about 12:30 pm/1:00 pm the Navy reported that a worker discovered an \\nAFFF release.  At about 2:38 pm the Navy notified DOH that approximately 1,100 gallons of an \\naqueous film forming foam concentrate was released in the tunnel and it impacted areas such as \\nAdit 6 itself, it went out of Adit 6 onto the asphalt and down the soil area and a culvert.  My \\ncoworker and I went to the scene at approximately 3:30 pm and what we had discussed with the \\nNavy on scene coordinator that was present on site, was to make sure that they delineated the spill \\nand immediately remove the AFFF impacted media.  We requested for EPAs technical \\nassistance.  DOH also requested a response action plan and a written sampling plan for soil and \\ngroundwater knowing the importance and gravity of the AFFF that was released.  DOH has been \\noverseeing the cleanup action and the cleanup response that has been going on at Red Hill and \\nDOH did receive the emergency response sampling plan for soil and groundwater on November \\n30th.  The Navy and DOH along with EPAs assistance came to an agreement with the sampling \\nplan for soil and groundwater.  DOH also requested for a waste management and disposal plan.  \\nDOH wanted to ensure that the waste was handled properly, and the disposal can be tracked from \\ncradle-to-grave.  In addition, we wanted to make sure that there is a decontamination plan for \\nAdit 6.  The Department of Health issued a notice of interest requesting for those things and \\nadditionally wanted to make sure that they provide us with other AFFF releases that had \\nhappened in the past to ensure that the cleanup is done properly.  As part of our mandate, the \\nDepartment also expected to receive from the Navy a 30-day written follow-up which DOH \\nreceived.  The first part of the cleanup was to do exterior excavation.  The initial excavation is \\ncomplete and they had collected approximately 150 cubic yards and that is currently stored off-\\nsite awaiting analytical results of how to and where to dispose of it.  On December 14, we had \\napproved a temporary cap of asphalt to prevent potential contamination from spreading and this \\naction reduces the risk to public health and the environment.  As the operations were ongoing \\n24/7 we were there and we could clearly observe the rains would collect in plastic covered \\nexcavated areas, so upon further discussion with the Navy it was best that they temporarily cap it \\nknowing that depending upon the sampling results, that more work needs to be done and they are \\nprepared to do the excavation.  Sampling has also been done for soil and groundwater, sampling \\nfor groundwater wells continues to be done weekly.  For the wells, we are awaiting validated data \\nand results will be discussed with the EPA and the Navy.  Are there any questions?  Thank you. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  I just had a question, I got a little bit confused, so have you \\nreceived the response plans, sampling plans, waste management and disposal plans? \\n \\nMs. Galvez:  Yes, we have received those, and they are posted online on our website. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  Have they met DOH expectations? \\n  \\nMs. Galvez:  It had undergone reiterations and with emergency response plans those plans change \\ndepending on the situation.  The latest one that is posted is the current one.  The waste disposal \\nplan is also posted on our website.  The DOH had provided comments and we will be working \\nwith them but know that in the meantime the waste has not gone anywhere.  Thank you. \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n13 \\n \\nMs. Seto introduced Roger Brewer, Senior Scientist, Department of Health \\n \\nMr. Brewer:  For the past 30 years one of my job tasks is to compile toxicity information for \\ndifferent compounds working with toxicologists to develop action levels as we call them for \\ndifferent compounds and drinking water.  The EPA has posted drinking water screening levels for \\nthree, or four maybe five PFAS by now.  Weve been doing other studies around Hawaii and we \\nknow we need a lot more than that so Ive been talking with multiple states around the U.S., \\ncompiling information they have as well as the EPA and we have drinking water action levels \\nnow for 19 almost 20 of these compounds and were still working with other agencies to continue \\ncompiling data.  It mostly reflects information the EPA has published but again that is limited so \\nwere working with other states giving presentations to multiple states plus EPA headquarters on \\nwhat were doing. \\n \\nMs. Seto introduced Kelly Ann Lee, Red Hill Project Coordinator \\n \\nMs. Lee:  I am going to give a brief summary of work being done under our Emergency Order \\nthat was finalized on May 6, 2022.  It requires the Navy to close and defuel the facility as quickly \\nand safely as possible.  In November 2022, the Navy with our oversight was able to unpack one \\nmillion gallons of fuel from the facility pipelines without incident.  Now that the facility is \\nunpacked, the Navy can begin doing repairs.  On November 1st they gave us a list of 253 repairs \\nthat were recommended before safety defueling can occur.  We are working with them to shorten \\nthat list to expedite the defueling timeline so repairs that are redundant or represent a low risk if \\nthey do not occur, we are giving the Navy permission to remove those repairs.  For example, two \\nweeks ago we approved a deviation from the repairs list that the Navy tells us may shorten the \\ndefueling timeline by three months.  Thats the sort of thing were going for.  Now Ill talk about \\nthe closure side.  On November 1st as well, we received the Navys closure plan.  We found it a \\nlittle lacking in detail, so we provided a list of 86 questions to them, and we are awaiting their \\nresponse and we have not yet approved the closure plan.  \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  As you probably all know, the Navy and EPA are about to enter an \\nAdministrative Order on Consent.  The EPA was required to come out for public hearing which \\ntook place on Wednesday and Thursday, the DOH participated in a science fair project to talk \\nabout all these things that are going on at Red Hill.  The big question that came up to us is why \\nisnt the DOH a party to the EPA and the Navys Administrative Order on Consent?  That really \\nis because the Department of Health feels very strongly that its administrative order is protecting \\nthe public health and the environment, and we want to ensure that we dont yield any of our \\nregulatory authority to anyone and keep it within the state.  Does anybody have any questions on \\nthe Emergency Order or the AOC emergency order interface? \\n \\nCommissioner Aurora Kagawa-Viviani:  I havent tracked this as much recently so this is a \\ndifferent Administrative Order on Consent? \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Thats correct.  There was a 2015 Administrative Order on Consent that the \\nEPA just entered and is doing a 2023 Administrative Order on Consent [Administrative Consent \\nOrder].  Its online and they are taking public comment until February 6. \\n \\nCommissioner Aurora Kagawa-Viviani:  What does this mean for the regular voting public? \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  The DOH had its Emergency Order and EPA did not have something similar \\nso this Administrative Order on Consent [Consent Order] allows them to regulate the \\ndefueling/decommissioning aspect of it.  There are other aspects of it that you should read if you \\nare very much interested but thats the gist of it. \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n14 \\n \\nCommissioner Buck:  This is not a question, Chair this is for your radar screen.  Last \\nadministration formed a Permitted Interaction Group which strongly recommended that we use \\nfurther regulatory authority of the Water Commission specifically to modify their water permits \\nto assure that long term recovery would happen.  That motion was unanimously approved by the \\nfull Commission, there was some resistance to implement that at the end of this last \\nadministration and I think some of this may be better discussed in executive session which Im \\nnot recommending now but Deputy Manuel is totally aware of the issue and can brief you.  I \\nthink we want to give you some time to absorb the full breadth of the Red Hill situation but that is \\nbecause it was unanimously approved by the Water Commission thats an issue that we would \\nlike to discuss with you and in cooperation with the Department of Health sometime for future \\nWater Commission meetings.  Thank you. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  Thank you very much Mike, appreciate getting the update on that and I will \\nget briefed by Kaleo regarding the status of Red Hill and Water Commissions interplay and the \\ncurrent situation.  Thank you.  Are there any other questions by the Commissioners?  Kathy, I just \\nwant to confirm the fact that DOH is not a signatory to the Consent Order, you are still retaining \\nyour regulatory authority and oversight on the Navys compliance with your own resolutions? \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Very much so with our Emergency Order. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  Are you ready to go toe to toe with them? \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Yes, of course I am.  Im ready to protect public health and the environment. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  I know you are, and I appreciate that very much.  Thank you so much. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  Is there any kind of environmental surveillance that is being \\nconducted that the Navy isnt doing, or a Navy contractor isnt doing just as the defueling \\nhappens because we dont want to be learning after-the-fact. \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  I think if you hold that thought, your question may be answered in the next \\ntwo speakers. \\n \\nMs. Seto introduced Dennis Lopez, Safe Drinking Water Branch Chief. \\n \\nMr. Lopez:  The water testing to date indicate compliance with the long-term monitoring.  \\nExceedances has predominantly been lead found in fixtures such as premise plumbing.  \\n[Mediation]Remediation response include replacement of the fixture or to take the fixture out of \\nservice.  Periods 1 to 3 starting April 2023 sampled 5% of homes and buildings for each monthly \\nperiod.  Approximately 1,630 buildings and home locations were sampled in the first three \\nperiods adding to the already 1,000+ building and homes sampled in stage 4.   Stage 5 is the long-\\nterm monitoring plan.  Period 4 was completed in November 2022, approximately 1,122 \\nbuildings and home locations were sampled, and we are now in period 5 which is slated to end in \\nMay 2023 with another 1,122 buildings and homes.  The LTM will run to February 2024 and \\nwere keeping continued vigilance on all the buildings and homes and distribution systems.  As a \\nreminder, Red Hill shaft is not part of the distribution system, that is [it is] isolated [from the \\ndistribution system].  The Navys Aiea Halawa shaft is currently not in use and the joint base \\nPearl Harbor and the consecutive system Aliamanu military reservation is being served by a \\nsingle source in Waiawa. \\n \\nMs. Seto introduced Fenix Grange, Hazard Evaluation Emergency Response Office. \\n \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n15 \\n \\n \\n \\nMs. Grange:  I have been leading the environmental team, evaluating the groundwater, and doing \\nour best to understand whats happening in the subsurface with the previous spills and looking \\nahead to ensure that the Navy has done the work necessary to be ready should a spill happen.  \\nDuring defueling there are many efforts being overseen by our engineering folks as well as to \\nensure that the likelihood over these is low but nonetheless it is very important, we understand \\nwhere fuel might go should that happen so that we can be prepared and protect our groundwater \\nsources.  We do that in a few ways in terms of directing the Navy to put in additional sentinel \\nwells so that we have early warning systems to protect the Board of Water Supply wells as well \\nas other water sources.  The way the data that we [collet]collect is regular monitoring, \\ngroundwater monitoring, so they put monitoring on a very frequent basis and then we have our \\nsubject matter expert study those to understand what kinds of patterns we are seeing.   \\n \\nThe other thing that has been the responsibility of the Navy was to complete a groundwater flow \\nmodel to be able to understand how the water is moving, what direction it is moving and so that \\nhelps us understand how contaminants are transported.   \\n \\nWe also require contaminant fate and transport, thats generally how fluid spilled on the ground, \\ninto the ground, moves above the water table, but underground.  With the lava flows here, fuels \\ncan get trapped in pockets in some places, but they can flow rapidly through cracks and other \\nsorts of things like that, so we are working hard to try to understand what is happening there.  The \\ngroundwater modeling efforts the Navy have done to date, we have not found satisfactory in \\nterms of their ability to represent well data that we collect, changes in temperature, chemistry of \\nthe water and sorts of things like that so we continue to work with them on that, for now we are \\nalso very focused on additional efforts including field studies.  The University of Hawaii \\nreceived a grant from the Office of Naval Research with Don Thomas as the principal \\ninvestigator so he has independent federal funding to be able to further investigate and help us \\nwith modeling.  We do have a lot of data coming in and one of the questions from one of the \\nconstituents, Katherine McCallahan, she had a list of questions and to save time today Im not \\ngoing to go over them one by one, but I have them ready to send to her and Id be happy to send \\nthem to the Commission as well.  It really has to do with understanding what the long sheets of \\ndata that come from the Department that are posted on the DOH website and what they mean, etc. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  I just want to confirm, are you going to be able to make that data available \\nto the Water Commission? \\n \\n \\nMs. Grange:  The results are available on our DOH website and its a cumulative summary of all \\nthe data collected under our EO, May and November 2021 releases.  Katherine had specific \\nquestions why there appear to be data gaps in certain areas and why sometimes the data didnt get \\nposted especially right after the May release samples were collected starting in May.  We were \\nnot able to get our hands on the data until late in the summer and some of the data in June and \\nJuly, we didnt get until late September, so we were not able to post those in time.  Again, theres \\na lot of detail here and Im happy to send both the data sheet and this information together, that \\nmight be the easiest way to understand what we are talking about, what the questions are and \\nwhat our answers are. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  Thanks, Fenix for the update.  My understanding was that at a \\ntime when you were waiting for the Navy to hand over data and there were lags, so now DOH is \\ntaking independent sampling?  Is that correct?  Categorizing them separately? \\n \\n \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n16 \\n \\n \\nMs. Grange:  We dont do that consistently but yes, we do.  We did quite a bit of that after the \\nNovember release and in December and January.  That also involves our field staff, observing, \\ncollecting samples, etc.  Similarly, with the AFFF spill that happened recently our folks were out \\nthere watching and collecting samples as well. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  Are those data back from the lab?  Are they posted on the DOH \\nwebsite and is it in the same place?  From what I remember it was sometimes hard to navigate \\nwhat information was where. \\n \\nMs. Grange:  We have an agreement with the Navy to produce that data so it should be posted on \\nFriday of this week for the PFAS release and that includes data from the soil and groundwater \\nwells. \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Aurora, theres a recognition on my behalf, our website can be difficult or \\nunfriendly, so we are actively working on trying to make it easier to navigate. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  I think I noticed that it was more organized for public access so \\nits good to know it will all be accessible through that website, thank you. \\n \\nMs. Grange:  Just one more note, the AFFF the laboratory they are using for the PFAS has been \\nwhat we understood from talking with the Navy is its taking time for those data to come back as \\nwell.  They have most of the first weeks data so the goal for Friday is to be able post all of the \\nfirst two weeks of data that were collected.  Those are the most significant, the ones they were \\ntrying to categorize or figure out where the edges of contamination were, etc. \\n \\nChairperson Change:  Im kind of the new kid on the block, is DOH the repository of data?  Do \\nyou collect BWS data as well? \\n \\nMs. Grange:  The BWS data belongs to them.  We would certainly be delighted to have it and I \\nthink there is interest on all parties to be able to share data so we can all see whats going on.  We \\nhave acted as a repository of the Navys data and of our data and the Navy has it online as well.  \\nThey are currently expanding their safe water site that was originally for the drinking water for \\nneighborhoods that were affected by the spill, but they now have an environmental data section \\nonline.  It is in its beginning stages but that is there as well and as Kathy mentioned were looking \\nto figure out how to make access to the information and the way the information is presented in a \\nmore user-friendly way, so you dont end up having to go through lots of different documents or \\nsearch through large excel files.  We are still working on that, and the Navy is doing that as well. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  Essentially, you dont have BWS data? \\n \\nMs. Grange:  We do not have BWS data.  We have spoken about that with them and still hope \\nthat we can get it.  Every piece of data that we have about what is happening in different parts of \\nthe region especially around their wells helps model and understand what might be happening in \\nthat area and they are also similarly interested in our data. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  Thank you very much. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  Given this new potential AOC what does DOH feel is an \\noptimistic timeline for defueling since you folks have been on this for a long time? \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  We recognize that fuel in the tanks can lead to a catastrophe, but there is also \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n17 \\n \\na recognition that if we defuel too quickly without critical repairs to the pipeline, it could lead to a \\nsimilar catastrophe.  We are trying to balance the two.  We do believe the repairs to the pipeline \\nare critical as we defuel and were hoping that the repairs to the pipeline will be done sometime in \\nearly 2024 and defueling subsequently. \\n  \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  Completed in early 2024? \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  DOH and EPA are looking at any possible way that we can shorten that \\ntimeline. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  Without cutting corners. \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Absolutely, we dont want another catastrophe. \\n \\nMs. Seto:  Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani, we have the Navys latest defueling schedule as a link \\non our website so you can find that there.  We also have a condensed timeline version that the \\ndepartment has compiled that was shared at our open house last week Thursday. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  Would you mind screen sharing just for those watching and the \\npublic so they know that we should all go check out the website? \\n \\nMs. Seto:  This is our DOH website for the Red Hill Water Information \\n(https://health.hawaii.gov/about/red-hill-water-information/) you would go to the EO and the \\ncondensed timeline would be at this location here.  This is the summary of the defueling timeline \\nwhere we have the Navys estimate of repairs to be completed by November 7, 2023, and \\ndefueling estimated to be completed by June 24, 2024. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  Thats helpful thank you for giving us a brief tour of the site. \\n \\nCommissioner Katayama:  Im not sure if this is for Joanna or Kathy, this is forward looking as \\nyouve gone through the Red Hill experience you have a 900-pound gorilla sitting on top of a \\n1,800-pound valuable resource and from the cheap seats at 60,000 feet, it seems like the \\ninstitutional knowledge of the operators of that 900-pound gorilla werent very good.  Looking \\nforward, can you recommend things that the Commission can look at to be more proactive rather \\nthan reactive to these situations?  I recognize DOH has a certain responsibility for safe drinking \\nwater and EPA has a certain responsibility for water quality, but it seems that the Navys \\ninstitutional knowledge and coping with the potential hazard of the fuel has been suspect in my \\nmind where they keep turning wrong valves or getting contractors who are directed to do work. \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Thats a good question, operationally the Navy has demonstrated they were \\nnot able to operate that facility safely which led to our first Emergency Order, which is why we \\nissued that first Emergency Order.  We are committed to overseeing the defueling in addition to \\nthe repairs.  There are going to be drills on the defueling itself and there is going to be monitoring \\nboth by EPA, DOH and independent contractors as they defuel.  Hopefully it will go as it did with \\nthe unpacking which we went through similar drills.  They didnt release any fuel at that time, \\nand they unpacked approximately one (1) million gallons of fuel out of those pipelines and so I \\nthink if we continue to be vigilant and make them go through the steps and monitor, hopefully we \\ncan successfully defuel these tanks. \\nCommissioner Katayama:  Are you recommending organizational changes to develop \\ninstitutional knowledge so they can be proactive in managing the current water systems that they \\nhave responsibility for? \\n \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n18 \\n \\n \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Thats a separate question so youre talking about the use of their water and \\nmanaging their water system. \\n \\nCommissioner Katayama:  With all the different hazards that they have, being in the military, \\nthats what you deal with. \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  I think that can be best answered by Dennis who is the Manager of the Safe \\nDrinking Water Branch. \\n \\nCommissioner Katayama:  Are there any other situations like that where you have maybe a 400-\\npound gorilla sitting on a 400-pound water resource? \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Generally speaking, the DOH regulates the water system provider.  We \\nwould regulate BWS or the Navy, its up to the purveyor of that water to provide safe drinking \\nwater to its customers.  The other thing is, currently the Navy is not getting its water from Red \\nHill shaft.  Theyre getting it from Waiawa Shaft which is the same shaft that we are all getting \\nour water from.  First, we need to remediate the aquifer before we can come to that determination \\non how they are going to regulate that water to their users, if anybodyJoanna or Dennis if you \\nwant to chime in? \\n  \\nCommissioner Katayama:  Im looking more to be in proactive mode, I dont want to be in \\nreactive mode.   \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  I understand that and maybe thats a discussion we can have as a \\nCommission. \\n  \\nCommissioner Katayama:  I think thats the value of what we provide as CWRM, you have your \\njob and I understand and thank goodness for that, thanks, Kathy. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  I wasnt sure if there was a response from Dennis? \\n \\nMr. Lopez:  I thought I was being asked to comment, I can still comment if Commissioner \\nKatayama wants me to, if he can rephrase the question for me. \\n \\nCommissioner Katayama:  I just wondered from the lessons learned, as youre going through this \\nRed Hill situation, rather than being reactive to situations, what can we do to be more proactive in \\nassuring ourselves whoever the purveyor is, has institutional knowledge to anticipate before a \\nsituation gets out of hand, where it endangers our water systems, what can we do? \\n \\nMr. Lopez:  When we did assist the EPA with the water system portion of the AOC proposed \\n2023 EPA Consent Order, we worked it with them to put together a plan to increase their \\ncapability to respond to clear the drinking water system.  A couple of items that we had them put \\nin is to have a hydraulic model which the water distribution system was lacking.  During the \\nresponse time it prohibited flushing techniques that they couldnt do.  Other items that we wanted \\nthem to make sure that the Navy had as part of their response is a valve maintenance program.  \\nSome of the excuses the Navy had is they didnt want to touch certain valves and hence they \\ncouldnt do unidirectional flushing.  All the excuses that came up to us, we helped the EPA put \\nthat into the plan.  We couldnt mandate it because we had to think about all the other water \\nsystems out there and not everybody has the resources to come up with a flushing plan with a \\nhydraulic model.  But the Navy is a special situation, and with the proposed 2023 EPA[]] Consent \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n19 \\n \\nOrder it allowed us that path to assist them to improve their water system.  The Navy has a lot of \\nmoney that was put into their maintenance program but when the money gets there it gets pushed \\nin different directions.  They have a utility, that had in our opinion, deferred maintenance over \\ntime and we want to make sure that theyre able to respond if something happens.  The threat is \\nnot only Red Hill they could have a backflow issue with all the industrial processes over there \\nand so were hoping that will create the model and encourage systems to learn from this and \\nimprove their systems accordingly.  Were not a permitted driven entity, we want to bring \\neverybody into compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act.  We do provide funding through \\nour low interest loans, the SRF Program to help the water systems deliver that clean water to their \\ncustomers.  However, the Navy as a federal entity cannot participate in our SRF Drinking Water \\nState Revolving Fund funds but theres a lot of funds out there for the rest of the 130+ systems \\naround the islands.  We also have principal forgiveness loans for the small systems that are \\ndisadvantaged so this is a great opportunity.  I know I kind of diverted on my conversation, but I \\njust want to promote that we do have a SRF program and we want to not only help the Navy, but \\nwe want to help all our public water systems. \\n \\nCommissioner Katayama:  Good to know, thank you.  \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  My question riffs off Commissioner Katayamas which is we \\ndidnt have a December meeting and it would have been a good chance to think about what have \\nwe learned in the last year and what kind of institutional changes do we need to implement to \\nfunction better in future potential water crises?  One thing the permitted interaction group \\nstruggled with, and it seems like were talking more openly now, not in executive session, so that \\nis helpful, but what is the role that the Commission plays?  As you said, we need to clean up the \\naquifer and that has implications for how we consider our available water, if its contaminated, is \\nit available at cost for cleanup?  What is the role that you guys see?  Couple of us know where we \\nthink the Commission should be at the table with DOH, but where does DOH see the \\nCommission playing an important a role? \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  As you know, we do have a meeting with the Navy, EPA, CWRM and USGS \\nto talk about these things, so perhaps that could be a place where all of the trustees of the resource \\ncan determine what roles we play.  I think theres going to be a meeting of the RRAPR in \\nFebruary. \\n \\nCommissioner Hannahs:  First of all, Id like to thank the DOH for the presentation today and for \\nall that youre doing in this regard.  Whats challenging for me in these reports whether its the \\nNavy or EPA or Department of Health, what does it mean for us?  What is our kuleana here and \\nhow do we optimize our working relationship and collaboration with other agencies?  Kathy if it \\nexists, let me know if it can happen.  Id like your opinion on that as well as is there some kind of \\ncollaboration agreement amongst the agencies that identifies our shared goals, that talks about the \\nduties of the parties and talks about how we are going to coordinate our action plans to optimize \\neach others outcomes.  Does that exist?  Shouldnt it? \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  I think thats one of the goals of what we call the RRAPR (Red Hill \\nRemediation & Restoration Action Plan Roundtable).  One of the goals is to get all the trustees \\ntogether and to work towards understanding with EPA and the Navy on remediation of the \\naquifer. \\n \\nCommissioner Hannahs:  I think thats essential, its critical for us to do our job. \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Kaleo has been participating in the RRAPR. \\n \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n20 \\n \\n \\nCommissioner Hannahs:  Well it would be good to see that as we sit here and we see the actions \\nand the duties of the parties and they coordinate a plan, then we have milestones when these \\nreports come in we can have a discussion of what the milestone was for various agencies and \\ntheir progress toward achieving that and what the variances are and then what the consequences \\nof those variances are for our own individual efforts that are our kuleana and not yours or EPAs \\nor the Navys.  So brand new year, lets set some goals and maybe we could come up with that \\ncollaboration agreement.   \\n \\nSecond, with respect to our Commission, it seems to me and correct me if Im not getting this and \\nwhen I use the word resource, I mean freshwater resource.  Our job is to protect resource \\nquantity, to manage resource accessibility, usually thats by giving permits to wells and so forth \\nor in some cases taking wells offline.   \\n \\nThird, allocate resource prudently so as this crisis unfolds it seems to me we are wanting to know \\nare we doing all that we can and using all the tools that we have to dispatch those three key \\nkuleana that we have.  We work together with BWS and DOH - whats the threat to this resource \\nthat we need to protect and what do we need to do?  Number one, we took it offline along with \\nthe BWS so that helps to reduce the threat.  With respect to resource accessibility, were not \\ngoing to access that, we need to develop more resources, we need more well permits out there, we \\nneed to support that - what are we doing and what is the timeframe for that, what are the targets \\nfor that?   \\n \\nFinally, as were allocating resources, what do we need to do to change the permits that we have \\noutstanding?  Whether its to the Navy or anybody else do we need to reduce peoples \\nallocations, what do we need to do?  This is not a criticism, its just as we look forward with \\nexcitement about how to do our jobs better in this new year.  Can we get to that, where we then \\nare having these reports and getting this information, all this detail in the context of a plan, where \\nare targets are and where were on plan and where were ahead of plan? \\n \\nDeputy Manuel:  I totally agree, just in trying to keep up with DOH as our sister agency on the \\nquality side.  This past year has been really trying to figure out how to best support each other in \\nthis process.  The permitted interaction group started last January and wrapped up with its report \\nin June or July, so it took us some time to figure out where we wanted to go and what we wanted \\nto see done.  I think theres been clear guidance at least from the Commission thus far, we need to \\nupdate and refresh with this new administration of where we want to go.  As Governor Green said \\nin his State of the State Address, he and his administration are committed to taking on a more \\nactive role and coordinating at the state level.  Deputy Ho will be the lead and we are all going to \\nfind ways to support her through that.  Just in case you didnt get the State of the State Address, \\nthat is what he said, Deputy Ho will be the lead.   \\n \\nWe as a member of this body, it is critical that we find ways to coordinate between DOH and the \\nWater Commission in what we do.  The RRAPR was brought up, Katie Roth, Head of our \\nPlanning Branch, it is a planning function and its the idea of bringing together all these various \\nplans and commitments that have been made, related to remediation of the aquifer, but also just to \\nshort term plans of defueling into one repository of information.  Commissioner Buck was also a \\npart of that RRAPR conversation so weve provided critique on how we can improve that and \\nwere working with those parties to make it the best tool that we can all work on and use.  What I \\ndo see happening is we may need to develop one specifically for the Water Commission, so we \\ndont get gobbled up in the larger kuleana of remediation.  We have our specific goals and \\nmetrics that we want to see accomplished so thats something Im committed to.  You will see \\nmore data and more information coming back to the Commission and my commitment is to hold \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n21 \\n \\nspace on Red Hill with this body because it is complicated, it is complex, theres a lot of \\ninformation that needs to be shared.  Having something to report to you every month, I think like \\nyou mentioned, is going to be helpful to see forward progress and not a bunch of running in \\ncircles on this issue. \\n \\nCommissioner Hannahs:  I certainly appreciate the Governors confidence in Kathy and the \\ndepartment and support that.  We want to be a member of the team, but we have an important \\nresponsibility in and of ourselves for managing this vital resource and it seems to me it helps her \\ndo her job as well as help us do our job if we really have a clear understanding of what our needs \\nare to make the decisions we need to make about this resource.  Lets lock that in and then youre \\ninformed and with that youre able to carry that to the meetings that you have with all the other \\nagencies. \\n  \\nChairperson Chang:  I appreciate that and if I could just chime in, I think as Kathy mentioned if \\nthis RRAPR meeting is going to occur in February, perhaps the next meeting we can have a real \\ngood hard conversation whether that is in executive session or open session.  This is what Ive \\nbeen telling our DLNR divisions, our kuleana is hard enough as it is so Im about staying in our \\nlane, but I want to know what our lane is too.  Likewise, with the Water Commission, coming \\nback on what Commissioner Hannahs is talking about, I think we need to be very clear so that \\nwhen our representative sits on that meeting, theyre advocating a clear message from where we \\nsee our kuleana to be.  Kaleo will schedule that for our next meeting, and if we need a special \\nmeeting or something in preparation for that just to empower you with a clear message from the \\ncommission.  Clearly, I need to get up to speed so you and I can talk story about outcomes and \\nwhere we need to go forward. \\n \\nMs. Seto:  I have one last portion of the website to share.  This is on the Red Hill Shaft filtration \\nand discharge into Hlawa Stream.  This is the last section of the table, and it provides you with a \\nRed Hill weekly operations report for the discharge that is going through the GAC system and \\ninto Hlawa Stream. The report of January 8-14 says that they have been averaging a discharge of \\n4.23 mgd per day.  There have been 42 samples taken per week for influent and effluent and all \\nthe result have been non-detect.  That is all I have for the report that we are giving today. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  I greatly appreciate DOHs comprehensive update to the Water \\nCommission. \\n \\n \\nPUBLIC TESTIMONY \\n \\n \\nMs. Katherine McClanahan:  Thank you so much for having me, my family and I were guests of \\nthe island during the contamination at Red Hill, I wanted to come today and Ive appreciated just \\nlistening to the Commissions role and if youll bear with me just ever so slightly off of the \\nquestions that Fenix already said she would offline discuss with me based on some of the data \\nCommissioner Katayama commented about being proactive versus reactive.  Our families really \\nexperienced that the down side of being reactive if you look at the future of Oahus aquifer, your \\npublic health, your environment, I think what Commissioner Katayama was saying is indeed the \\nfocus.  Couple of my questions still have to do with that.  One of the main ones is for the \\nDepartment of Health, when did you receive groundwater sampling data for the May 2021, June \\n2021, July 2021 dates?  Ill leave the remainder of the question but it kind of has to do with that \\nanswer. \\n \\nMs. Grange:  I did have a chance to go through your questions.  The first data over that summer \\nwe did not get data from the Navy for a long time, so we didnt get what was going on.  I think \\nour first data we received was in August 2021, so the release was made in May, it took a while to \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n22 \\n \\nget sampling under way, etc.  Then the July data we didnt receive until the end of September and \\nthe Navy reported that the labs were backed up and it was just taking a very long time.  We didnt \\nget those data until later and then things had already happened and eventually some effects, the \\nripple effect. \\n \\nMs. McClanahan:  Is that a common practice that the DOH struggles with, to receive data that \\nyoure expecting to receive from the Navy?  Groundwater sampling data, has that been a pattern, \\na history there? \\n \\nMs. Grange:  We have had some continuing issues with that, yes, partly some of it had to do with \\nsimply the volume of samples that were coming in.  One of the things that is very important to us \\nis as soon as they do get access to the data, we need to see it right away. \\n \\nMs. McClanahan:  I guess Ill leave it with this, to your Commission and just focusing on the \\nfuture of your aquifer.  Just as a resident, that to me, is a problem that we have all experienced \\nand if somebody has the magic answer to being able to provide your Commission, families, the \\npublic, data in a timely manner, is there some force of consequence for public notice that can go \\nout when data is delayed by default?  I feel like in the future, for your aquifer and your \\nprotections if every time the Navy has something of concern, and they just decide to not give you \\nthe data, what are your recourses?  Maybe getting the Governor involved to have a stronger force \\nto come back and alert the public and the purveyor who is delinquent in getting the information.  I \\nappreciate all your work.  I wish you all a wonderful and healthy future aquifer.  My family and I \\nhave moved off now but we are going to continue fighting for the future for our loving friends \\nand family on Oahu and for your future aquifer.  Ill take offline conversation with Fenix, I \\nappreciate it. \\n \\nMs. Susan Pcola-Davis:  Lots of interesting conversation and lots of catching up from December.  \\nI will go through my questions.  I dont know if you saw them ahead of time.  I also provided \\nseven attachments you can look at later.  Im not going to digress from my questions.  Im going \\nto start with environmental action levels, and I have questions, but I dont know if they can be \\nanswered.  Using a plume degradation scenario, non-degrade JP-5, action levels are currently at \\n266 ug/l.  When posed with this question of how a sample indicating a 265 would be described as \\nnon-detect, Im not sure why I could not get an answer yesterday.  Say youre in your house and \\nyou get your sample report back and highest action level is 266 and you get a finding of 265, \\nwould you feel comfortable having an only one-unit difference between being called its detected \\nor non-detected?  Mr. Brewer explained how the number is determined.  Mind you at the \\nDecember 15, 2022, BWS meeting, he said his spreadsheet had an error and he had to recalculate.  \\nHe also explained how he is a risk assessor not a toxicologist.  He says he solicits information \\nfrom many sources, which is great, but in the most recent publication by the Department of \\nHealth, there are updated environmental action levels with strict calculation models for EALs.  \\nDid you use that model to develop the spreadsheet?  In my questions Im also asking for your \\ncredentials, exactly how are EAL levels decided, by whom, give us the names.  Does that make \\nyou feel confident that his spreadsheet doesnt have any more errors?   \\n \\nNext on my agenda is sampling.  During the actual sampling, Department of Health used several \\nlower incident specific levels 300, 200 and 211.  The Department of Health still hasnt clearly \\nexplained to the public why that was, so my question is why?  Upon review of the online \\nsampling reports, it appears that any sample of TPH-g,o,d that fell below the incident specific \\nlevel was determined as non detect, leading customers to believe their drinking water was clear \\nof any fuel, which is not true.  If a sample is collected, using the incident specific level of 200 and \\nthe sample is 199, 199 will be notated as non detect and not 199.   \\n \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n23 \\n \\nLastly, is the Department of Health and the EPA and the consent order.  The thing I wanted to say \\nand maybe a question Ms. Ho can think about, is what regulatory authority would you be giving \\nup or the state be giving up if you partnered with the EPA on this consent order?  Although I have \\nheard you several times say that youre going to stick with the 2015 Emergency Order, which I \\nplan to go over tonight to compare it with the Consent Order to see whats the big deal.  What \\npower is this that youre trying to give up?   \\n \\nWere talking about the amount of water that is going from Red Hill Shaft into the Hlawa \\nStream.  At the meeting yesterday we talked about when was the last time that fuel was detected \\nat the Red Hill Shaft discharging millions of gallons into Hlawa Stream?  There probably was a \\ndate but they have not found or determined whether all this water going into Hlawa Stream is \\nbeneficial or not but after 14 months of doing this and wasting our water, wouldnt it be nice to \\nknow?  Dennis, I appreciate your understanding of unidirectional flushing and hydraulic models \\nand the valves.  The Navy is not understanding of this and if you provide any information to them \\nto keep them on track for the long-term monitoring project to go on, the public will send you \\nflowers.  Thank you very much. \\n \\nDeputy Attorney General Julie China:  This is public testimony.  I guess it is at the option of \\nDOH to respond but they are not required to provide a response in this forum.  I just wanted to \\nsay that. \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Thank you for that, I think what wed like to do is, there were so many \\nquestions, could we respond to her questions in writing?  Is it different questions than what we \\nreceived yesterday?  If we put it up on our website is that the best way to respond? \\n \\nDeputy Attorney General China:  Yes, they are somewhat different. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  Ms. Picola-Davis, if you could forward those to DOH and then DOH if you \\ncould just make sure we get a copy of whatever the public response is.  I would agree with \\nDeputy Attorney General Julie China, this is public testimony but not intended to be a forum \\nwhere DOH is required to answer. \\n \\nMs. Pcola-Davis:  I know that they are not required to answer nor was I expecting them to.  I was \\njust sharing my questions as a person of the public.  I appreciate all the work that you do.  These \\nquestions have been emailed to DLNR for todays meeting and if Kathleen wants me to forward \\nthat email, I can.  Kathleen you are not obliged to answer the questions, I understand that.  If you \\nchoose to do that, I would appreciate it, but I know that you are a busy woman. \\n \\nMr. Tanaka:  I really want to express appreciation for the hard work that the Commission, \\nCommission staff, the Department of Health and their staff have been doing over the last 18 \\nmonths to address this crisis.  I wanted to highlight three problems.   \\n \\nFirst, I appreciate that there was swift action needed to prevent the spread of AFFF concentrate \\nafter the 1,300 gallons were spilled last year.  I think I have deep concerns about the capping, and \\nit wasnt only the capping but the backfilling over excavated areas which essentially means it is \\ngoing to be very difficult to re-excavate if necessary.  Im not sure if the DOH was able to \\nconduct an assessment, where the soil samples were taken, if they were able to take their own \\nsamples and have independent objective testing or if we are just relying on the Navy to indicate \\nwhether they were able to clean up their own mess.  Also, the facility is porous right?  A \\ntremendous amount of concentrate was released in the facility, and we know that rainwater \\ninfiltrates continually.  The concrete floor is also not watertight and there is also concern about \\nwhat is going on in the inside - it may be difficult to assess the remediation efforts.  Also looming \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n24 \\n \\nis the fact that they are going to continue using potentially AFFF.  They need some kind of fire \\nprotection capability within the facility.  I think it is important that we to keep the pressure up to \\nensure that they dont continue holding these forever chemicals just 100 feet above our \\ngroundwater aquifer.  The chemicals are tremendously toxic parts per quadrillion - for PFOA I \\nthink thats one drop in a thousand Olympic-sized swimming pools that could render this water \\nunsafe under the EPAs interim advisory guidelines.   \\n \\nThe second problem is the drinking water system that is not just the Navy but also civilian \\nhousing.  I really appreciate there were multiple attempts to refine the water testing process that \\nhas been going on, but we know from the September 2022 CDC/ATSDR survey that there are \\nalmost 300 people that continue to report seeing sheens in their water as well as almost 800 \\npeople continue to have health effects.   I want to urge continued thinking, regarding what might \\nbe the cause of the discrepancies.  We cant just dismiss one dataset because another dataset says \\nthe water is fine.  There are folks moving into these housing units who really dont have much \\ninformed consent to determine what their risk is should they decide to use their tap water for \\ndomestic use and consumption.  We know there are many other issues with the water systems, \\nthere could be other things in there both in jet fuel which isnt just pure TPH-d but could include \\nantimicrobial, antifreeze chemicals as well as just issues with their water systems - as we know \\nfrom the EPAs investigation has not been operated and still isnt being operated in compliance \\nwith safety water regulations.   \\n \\nThe third problem/issue is the need to be hypervigilant about the Navys water use.  We just \\nheard that they are dumping on an average 4.3 million gallons per day, multiply that by 360 days \\nyou get over 1.5 billion gallons.  This Commission has been urging them for over a year now to \\nstart planning on some kind of alternative reuse of some of that water so were not wasting our \\nmost precious resource.  Theres been discussions about evaluating the Navys water uses under \\ntheir water use permits issued by the Commission.  I do want to urge that you do take some \\nbolder positions.  I know the tendency is to be conservative about the states authority when it \\ncomes to the federal government, but we do have a gray area where now is the time to be \\nassertive.  If youre going to assert an aggressive position, this is it.  If its not now, I dont know \\nwhen that would be so to get a quick ask of you folks of the Commission members and basically \\neveryone listening, this EPA consent decree does provide an opportunity for us to get provisions \\nand concrete mechanisms and proactive tools that can avoid the issues with the 2015 \\nAdministrative Order and Consent which the non-enforcement have led the exacerbation of this \\ncrisis.  For your Commission members in your individual capacity, your comments as trustees of \\nour public trust, as guardians of our most precious resource will carry weight even if it is in your \\nindividual capacity.  I have three basic talking points that you might want to raise or that Id like \\nto respectfully urge you to raise if you do choose to reach out.  One is we need concrete \\ndeadlines, theres no deadlines in the consent decree and the deadlines aren't something to be \\nafraid of.  The Navys pipeline repair is going to be done by November.  Ask for a deadline for \\nAugust, which I think is within the realm of possibility by talking to the EPA if they miss the \\ndeadline.  It doesnt mean you just let it go, you can have an order to show cause, you can have \\nthe Navy come forward and explain what kind of extenuating circumstances may have caused \\nthem to miss the deadline.  Its not like youre going to force them to let it rip and endanger but at \\nleast youll have something there so the Navy knows theyll have to identify any excuses or \\njustifications they may have.  That way we have some safeguards against some of the foot-\\ndragging weve seen.  Advocate for concrete deadlines where you can check on the Navys \\nprogress, urge the Navy not to use P5 concentrates because we dont want another spill to push us \\npast the point of no return and we need on-island testing.  Im happy to talk to any folks offline \\nabout these ideas and if you have any questions.  Thank you for your time and attention. \\n \\n \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n25 \\n \\nMs. Gina Hara:  Im from Hlawa Valley and Ive been testifying at every board meeting since \\nlast January.  I just want you to know exactly what I said last January.  You are going to have \\nmeeting, after meeting, after meeting, everyone is super polite and here we go one year later.  We \\nare that much closer to another leak.  My positive suggestion for Commissioner Katayama, \\nCommissioner Hannahs, for everyone on this board, was to ask for a blow-by-blow accounting of \\nthe leaks that have happened so far.  How those mistakes have been incorporated and how the \\ndefueling, blow-by-blow, minute by minute, is really going to go down from the mouths of the \\nactual engineers.  This is a major surgery from which we, the people, who will be living with the \\nafter-effects.  If it is a botched surgery because we werent looking at the details enough, its \\ngoing to be catastrophic.  If we know anything from the past leaks, its not about the tanks, it \\nreally wasnt about the pipes, it was about the humans and the system, just like Commissioner \\nKatayama pointed out.  This series of exercises of dissecting what is the plan, we need that, I \\nwould like to ask this Commission to write a letter to be in support of this with a timeline of this \\nmonth.  I would like independent engineers from our community other than the Navy to weigh in \\nand talk about these details.  It may take a series of at least 10 times if you ask me, but lets just \\nhave one this month.  Thats my proposal and I agree with everyone prior, and I would like to ask \\nyou two things.  Can you also see yesterdays BWS meeting?  Its going to be online youll see \\nthe testimonies of people there in combination with what the Department of Health and the EPA \\nwere saying.  I think its a must see along with the movie Dark Waters, that will explain to us \\nwhat we are facing with our aquifers with respect to the forever chemicals. Thank you for your \\ntime. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  Thank you so much Department of Health for your presentation and your \\nupdates and participation in our meeting.  Thank you, Joanna, thank you so much for your team, \\nthank you Kathy. \\n2. \\nCWRM Budget and Legislative Updates  \\n \\nPRESENTATION GIVEN BY:  Deputy Manuel \\nDeputy Manuel:  Chair, Commissioners, as well as community, we wanted to take this \\nopportunity in the beginning of the Legislature to highlight where were at in the budget and \\nsome of the bills, at least the Administrative Bill thats been introduced as of yesterday and some \\nof the things that we may see or might not see coming out.  I dont think weve done this before \\nwith the Commission, but I think its timely and hopefully we can do this more often, keep you \\nupdated as our decision-making body.   \\n \\nWere known as LNR 404 in the DLNR budget, so you see that in budget worksheets, its very \\nbudget oriented, tons of spreadsheets in excel - that is our budget number.  In general, heres our \\nbase budget weve talked a lot about lack of resources or need for more resources and this is a \\nquick summary from my very simplistic view as an administrator.  We have 27 positions within \\nthe Water Commission, four of those were added in during my last tenure, prior to that weve \\nbeen short.  Since 1987 its been around this much between the teens and the twenties.  These are \\n27 positions juxtaposed against the 1,084 positions of the overall DLNR budget.  When you talk \\nabout balance and need for resources, 27 out of 1,084 for water is really telling and that is the \\npicture I try to paint for most people.  Twenty-two of those are general funded, 5 are special \\nfunded out of the state land development fund, those are revenues generated from leases \\ndeveloped by Land Division before the Board.  Our FY 23 operating budget was a little over $4 \\nmillion that includes almost $3 million in GF.  We have a ceiling of $356,474 from our water \\nresource management special fund and a ceiling of $812,768 from what we call our SPAM \\nSpecial Fund.  This funds 5 positions but also has about $110,000 that comes from the SLDF \\nfund for steam studies.  It primarily pays for staff travel, the team that you see here doing our \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n26 \\n \\nstream monitoring measuring, etc. as well as pay for some of our stream gages.  The other general \\nfunds that are used, almost $2 million goes to staff personnel cost right now, about $1 million \\ngoes to the USGS gaging contract, so we have maybe less than half a million of discretionary \\nfunding for our general operations.  Thats just the world we have to work within.  We talk about \\nresources, managing resources, so those are some of the challenges we work on. \\n \\nCommissioner Hannahs:  Are all the positions funded positions? \\n \\nDeputy Manuel:  Great question.  No, the four Aquatic Biologist positions in SPAM Branch that \\nmake up the 27, those four were created in 2019, taken away during the pandemic and just got put \\nback in last session.  We are working on establishing those.  We have one vacancy in \\nGroundwater Branch that we are trying to fill.  On February 1, well just have those four Aquatic \\nBiologists positions and the 1 groundwater position thats vacant, so well have 22 filled \\npositions. \\n \\nCommissioner Hannahs:  Where do fines go? \\n \\nDeputy Manuel:  Fines will go into the Water Resource Management Fund, under 174C 5.5, that \\narticulates what that fund can be used for.  In general, Ive advocated for $2 million annually in \\nthe CIP budget for deep monitoring well development.  It costs about that much to do one deep \\nmonitoring well and weve been successful in upping that to a yearly request.  Prior \\nadministrations or strategies have been to ask every supplemental year, so every other year, but in \\nour USGS monitoring program, our proposed build out, its going to take 100 years if we just do \\none every two years.  We really need to ramp this up and ask for more development funds if we \\nwant to get a better understanding especially of our groundwater resource and aquifers in the face \\nof climate change.  \\n \\nNext, Im going to talk about whats in the budget now.  The four Aquatic Biologist positions \\nwere reestablished but whenever you reestablish start positions you only get half the year \\nfunding.  This year we are asking for full year funding which is identified there for those four \\nAquatic Biologist positions.  We are working with our HR office to determine whether that \\nclassification is appropriate or not and we may be shifting to some other classification like \\ngeneral professionals that gives us more flexibility to meet the needs of our staff and the work we \\nneed to do.  The CIP appropriation for deep monitoring wells, those are the two funding budgets \\nthat were approved that made it into the Ige Administration budget.  Legislation Senate Bill 1386 \\nwas just introduced yesterday but that was an administrative bill that we put in and this is relating \\nto declaring water shortages and emergencies.  Dealing with this Red Hill disaster and issue, one \\nof the things, working with the Attorney Generals office, is that the bill declaring emergencies \\nwas tied to the shortage and shortage planning as articulated in the Code, so what we are \\nrecommending is to split it out to say that if there is an emergency that the Commission has the \\nexplicit authority to declare an emergency.  Theres language and amendments to the Code to \\ngive the Commission that authority to deal with situations like this, hoping that we dont ever \\nhave to use it and that we can anticipate shortage with better data and planning and proactive \\nresearch, but if we didnt use that, wed have that tool available to us and that was in response to \\nthis Red Hill situation. \\n \\nNext is a graphic of DLNRs overall CIP budget.  The greenish color is the $2 million in CIP for \\ndeep monitoring well development.  Last year we got a lump fund appropriation from the \\nLegislature and as part of the kuleana of the Chair is to prioritize all the CIP projects throughout \\nthe agency.  Fortunately, Water Commission has been able to stay on top of that table and get part \\nof that lump sum of the portion of the $20,000,000.  I just wanted to show graphically some of the \\nthings that are also being balanced within the overall agency. \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n27 \\n \\nLastly, the Green Administration had asked us for potential budget modifications or requested \\nbudget items.  We added some but some of these were part of our original Ige Administration ask \\nbut werent in the Governors budget.  We submitted a request to add seven new positions to \\nGroundwater Branch and Survey Branch and thats really to ramp up and meet the needs of some \\nof our groundwater work and our water use permit approvals and reviews dealing with the Red \\nHill issue, etc.  I framed this under a climate crisis research and monitoring but its important that \\nwe start to put monies towards this.  Weve asked for additional funding to add more stream \\ngages to our system.  USGS can only handle about five gages a year so were asking for five \\nevery year and the idea is just to keep asking for that every single year.  Its still not going to get \\nus to build-out for another couple decades but were hoping that we can beef that up and partner \\nwith USGS and working with our Congressional Delegation to increase the federal resources in \\nthat program as well.  Limu research weve been working with Water Resource Research Center, \\nUniversity of Hawaii, DAR and KUA to build off the year of limu and actually look at how \\ngroundwater dependent ecosystems and the research that theyve done in Keauhou on limu.  We \\ncan start to partner with them because that is the next thing we have to understand is how \\ngroundwater affects nearshore ecosystems and the nearshore environments as another public trust \\nuse of water and just to support our work with Water Resource Research Center funding to help \\nwith the management of the Hawaii Mesonet program through the Hawaii climate data portal.  \\nTo shorten that timeframe of 100 years, if we develop a deep monitor well every year or every \\nother year, we need to do more and were wanting to increase that $5 to $10 million but were \\nalso looking at federal funding resources to hopefully supplement or double down on our state \\nbudget that we do get allocated here.  Thats generally our budget - omit the increase of $5 \\nmillion a year that didnt make it into the CIP.  Sorry, that was a typo that didnt get changed. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  We are trying to be optimistic with Governor Greens commitment to \\nclimate change.  To utilize that we need to be prepared from the Water Commission side to \\naddress Commissioner Katayamas question about being proactive.  What can we do in light of \\nclimate change?  I think we need to be situated to take advantage of federal funds as well as the \\nGovernors commitment to climate change.  I do want to use our public Water Commission \\nmeeting also as a public forum as appropriate legislation arises to bring that to the Commissions \\nattention as well as the publics attention so that we create a forum for public to provide us \\ntestimony or comments on proposed legislation. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  I know this is constrained with the practicality of the budget but \\ntwo questions  one, where in your positions is there a point person to interface with DOH as we \\nhave joint responsibilities and two, are there positions that do not yet exist in divisions, that may \\nnot exist, that would be ideal to have, just so we keep in mind the ideal capacity of CWRM versus \\nthe current? \\n \\n \\nDeputy Manuel:  We havent dreamt yet about what the ideal CWRM full build-out would look \\nlike.  Youre quickly reminded in government - thats too big and too much.  I hear what youre \\nsaying and one of the things in the next four years Im committed to, is helping to support staff to \\nbuild their capacity and get more bodies in and part of that is growing smartly in a smart way.  \\nWhen you throw massive lumps of money and resources, the training, the onboarding, that \\nchange in culture is a shock.  What Ive been proposing with staff is these realistic requests for \\nstaffing and budget so we can grow smart and help to build that capacity over time.  What youre \\nseeing, is talking with staff, where we believe we need to focus right now to meet current needs, \\nbut also will help to build capacity in the long term.  Thats my short answer.  With DOH, the \\ngroundwater team does interface regularly with DOH, especially on their safe drinking water \\nside.  Planning also takes a large role with coordinating with DOH.  One of the things Kathy and I \\nhave talked about as Deputies in this next round, and thanks for confirming me, is to really \\ntighten up our DOH and CWRM staff collaboration, our processing, and to really understand who \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n28 \\n \\nis on first and in certain situations tighten up that relationship.  Looking at funding opportunities, \\nthey have the revolving loan funds - whether those resources could be used and leveraged with \\nCWRMs limited resources to align projects or move together in certain ways.  Its a long-winded \\nanswer, but I think theres enough momentum to better align the limited resource we do have \\nwith the leadership thats in place.  Kathy and I are continuing from the last administration so I \\nthink we can hit the ground running, unlike other departments that really have to build that \\nmomentum up.  Im hopeful, not putting Kathy on the spot, but I think we can do good things \\ntogether and keep up the momentum that weve created. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  I appreciate the question, too.  I think this administration as well as our own \\ninternal is really committed to better internal coordination.  We need to be in sync - theres really \\nno reason because it all goes back to the public trust.  When we arent in sync it leads to public \\nmistrust.  I think this administration is really emphasizing the need for greater coordination \\ninternally both within your own agency and externally with your sister agencies before we go out \\nto the public.  Theres a real desire to do that.  Also, with respect to DLNR we have been living \\nquite frankly over the last decade, hand to mouth, but theres going to be a great infusion of both \\nfederal funds and this administration, as well as the Legislatures commitment to climate change, \\nfor us to be in the lead of that.  Like Kaleo said, we need to think big, and we need to start \\nplanning.  We need to look at strategic planning, over the next 10, 20 years so all this emphasis \\non being more proactive, there is going to be a change of a mindset internally at DLNR.  Many of \\nour divisions are generating revenue that they have not done before so we are looking at more \\nstrategically at the future.  We ask for your patience but there is a desire to be much more \\nefficient and effective with our resources so that we can do better for the general public. \\n \\n \\nDeputy Manuel:  Chair, getting to the full build-out, what resources and staff would be \\nappropriate.  The framework update to the Hawaii Water Plan, it is a tool and a mechanism, and \\nputting that out there as a fellow planner, to really take that long-term perspective and build-out \\nto that.  I think once that framework update is completed and approved by this body, we are going \\nto set the tone and vision for the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years.  Then well be able to figure out and \\ndetermine what are the resources we need to accomplish those overall long-term plan goals.  That \\nframework is looking at climate change, place-based management and elevating traditional and \\necological knowledge and practice of native Hawaiians, that holistic world view on water \\nresource management.  Once that framework is solid, and this body adopts it, then we can start to \\nbuild-out that team to accomplish those large goals and visions. \\n \\nCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani:  This is me switching to my UH hat.  I just want to put it out \\nhere while DOH and CWRM are in the same room.  The University and especially some \\ndepartments are undergoing a big turnover and theres going to be a lot of hires in the next several \\nyears because people have retired during the pandemic and there will be new openings.  I think it \\nwould a great opportunity to make sure the UH is engaged - Water Resource Research Center is \\nalso rebuilding and to think about that.  Im also part of a scoping effort to think about what are \\nthe pathways we need to place people in water professions and its not just in engineering.  To the \\nextent possible, please dont forget UH is part of your resource team. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  Weve already engaged President Lassner about having more internships, \\nhaving greater pathways, so that you get trained here within DLNR and when positions become \\navailable, theres a nice smooth transition.  Theres no reason why government should not be \\nlooking upon itself to provide a lot of these resources so we can keep our local kids here.  We are \\ncommitted just as you are to both the University as well community colleges and even high \\nschools, to start them on this pathway towards this conservation, preservation, movement so \\nthank you for that. \\n \\nMinutes \\n \\nJanuary 24, 2023 \\n29 \\n \\nCommissioner Ho:  Just so you know, DOH is also looking at work force development so please \\nsend people our way as well. \\n \\nChairperson Chang:  Were all tapping into the same people.  Kaleo, do we have the meeting \\nschedule for the next two meetings? \\n \\nDeputy Manuel:  The next two meetings are there on the agenda and we will be coordinating, \\nwith your guidance, on some of the follow-up on what you wanted to hear and see.  Thank you so \\nmuch for the flexibility on shifting to the last Tuesday for todays meeting. \\n  \\nChairperson Chang:  I appreciate that, weve been kind of jamming on a lot of things, but we did \\nwant to have a meeting this month, so I appreciate everybody making it and this concludes our \\nmeeting.  Mahalo, mahalo, mahalo.  A hui hou. \\n \\nD. \\nCOMMISSION MEETING SCHEDULE (tentative) \\n \\nFebruary 21, 2023 (Tuesday) \\nMarch 21, 2023 (Tuesday) \\n \\nMeeting adjourned at 5:14 pm. \\n \\n \\n \\nRespectfully submitted, \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nKATHY YODA \\n \\nSecretary Pro Tem \\n \\nOLA I KA WAI: \\n \\n \\n \\nM.
