COMMISSIONER [SETO] KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Yeah, yeah.

DEPUTY MANUEL: -- at this point. And he'll keep going through the rest of the system.

COMMISSIONER [SETO] KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Yeah. I don't want to hold that up.

DEPUTY MANUEL: No, no, no. That's -- yeah, that's the general summary. I think you'll be hearing that as well.

MR. IMATA: Okay. So I -- I believe this is where I left off, I think. We were looking at particularly Waimalu deep monitor well and how thick -- lens thickening is -- is maybe suggesting a hydraulic buffer.

So as you can see as a time series, we have -- the water table actually rose. It rose about maybe 18 and a half feet from May to April, May -- from 2005 till 2023. We do see again a thickening of the transition zone here. And this is, again, Ghyben-Herzberg. So this is telling us that where it should be, and maybe it's -- maybe it's arriving at a steady state condition, I don't know, but that this is -- this is the data that we're collecting from the Waimalu deep monitoring well.

So the last well that we're going to look at is the Waipio mauka deep monitor well. And again -- shucks, you know what? We'll -- I'll give you a little bit better information on this as we go through the Navy system wells. But again, this is the Waipio mauka deep monitor well that's located.
