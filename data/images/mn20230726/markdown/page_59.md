and our way forward.

So while I don't intend to go into great detail into everything on this slide -- again, this is what is posted on our website, and this is the -- really, the tool that I utilize every time I'm briefing on one of these major forums, but I did want to call out a few key efforts that I know have been part of the decisions within this committee in the past and are very important to our continued success in the remediation of Red Hill.

So moving down to the first section is the Monitoring and Sampling Effort, that first blue and the bars below it. Those are all related to our continued sampling to make sure we know what's going on in the soil but also below the soil all around Red Hill. The key area there is the monitoring well expansion. We've committed to 22 additional monitoring wells this year. We're making great progress on that. We've already got ten complete; there are four in progress, still have eight remaining. We also -- on that effort, there will be another discussion in October with all of those SMEs again, members from this commission, but also with DOH, EPA, and Board of Water Supply to talk about monitoring well locations that we currently are not proceeding with. Do we need to adjust where we're putting those to make sure we fully understand what the water underneath in the aquifer is doing?
