"Informational Briefing by University of Hawai‘i Biota Survey in Hālawa Stream, O‘ahu",0,C2,11/21/2023
"Dr. Yinphan Tsang, University of Hawaiʻi, Associate Professor in Hydrology",0,C2,11/21/2023
Dr. Ayron Strauch introduced Dr. Tsang and her team from the University of Hawaiʻi. She explained the effects of the Navy’s water discharge from the Hālawa Shaft into South Hālawa Stream.,0,C2,11/21/2023
Thank you for your research. Seems like the rising tide floated all the species or it benefited all the species. Will over time the non-native species propose a habitat transforming risk because they outcompete or they are predators of the natives?,0,C2,11/21/2023
"That's definitely a very unfortunate situation but that's what we are seeing right now and so far. You are probably already aware that we are experiencing a quite unusual drought situation this year. I think that's also contributing to this unprecedented dry condition that might have increased this environmental stressor like hotter environment and allow those more tolerant invasive species that can stay there while our native is probably not so happy there. So yes, that's likely what's going on right now.",0,C2,11/21/2023
"Putting the drought aside, are there strategies that you recommended or that are available to really better reduce that non-native population?",0,C2,11/21/2023
"The invasive eradication is challenging in many ways but it's not impossible. There are definitely other efforts I know of in different watersheds. For example Ala Wai watershed has been trying to take out the invasive species but, another thing that we should definitely try to understand is their differences in terms of their habitat usage and different preference. I think we can better create a habitat that is better suited for our native species, at the same time taking out the non-native species to restore our aquatic ecosystem.",0,C2,11/21/2023
"Your results are what would be expected, you increase flow you get more recruitment of native species, but you get a hard time getting rid of non- native species. Did you do any studies on mollusks? Hīhīwai? No? Did you do any studies on whether mollusks were able to get back up?",0,C2,11/21/2023
"Currently my lab doesn't have a study looking at the mollusk and funny that you asked this. I forgot to point out that the ʻōpae kalaʻole and it was there and then I think there was some sighting going on with other mollusks, but then I was not actually ready to summarize that information, yet. Cory, I saw you light up. You want to say something?",0,C2,11/21/2023
"We didn't see any native mollusks. They're pretty cryptic, too. We didn't want to disturb the habitat too much, but there's a lot of non-native mollusks, the quilted melania and other types of snails that were listed on the non-native figures. Unfortunately those were very obvious and very dominant so not likely that many native mollusks around at least in Hālawa Stream that we could tell. We weren't about to flip over all the boulders and rocks though but, there was some rock scrubbing. If there were some present at least on those size rocks they would have showed up in probably the benthic samples at least. We didn't see any.",0,C2,11/21/2023
"When they stop putting water into Hālawa Stream, everything will revert back to what it was, correct?",0,C2,11/21/2023
"That's definitely something we are concerned with and that was exactly the reason to do this research. This is actually more of a question to Navy. As far as we have learned from the last meeting we had with Navy is that they are planning to discharge the water indefinitely. Please correct me if I misunderstood that. Anyone on the team, is that what I understand correct? I think that's what I understand. Our team does meet with Navy, CWRM, DAR, and Department of Forestry and Wildlife monthly and to checking our results. But that's what we got so far that we are learning the Navy is planning to continue this discharge. Yes, now that we are attracting the native species back, what if they decided one day to discontinue, what does that mean.",0,C2,11/21/2023
"When we've had changes in the interim instream flow standards, those were more or less permanent. You could, for example in the Maui streams, you see a return of wildlife and that's probably going to go on indefinitely whereas these are episodic increases in streamflow so my expectation is when you stop it you revert back to the old signature. I guess you would agree with that?",0,C2,11/21/2023
"I will agree, actually.",0,C2,11/21/2023
"I would say not that it's in high density, but the Tahitian prawns are also a amphidromous migratory taxa, so distribution expanded as well and they were able to climb further upstream the more continuity there was. Again, that's I think what all of us expected but I just want to point out that on the non-native taxes side that those have an ocean larval phase so they are definitely migrating from upstream probably at a higher incidence than it would have been without that water. That's it.",0,C2,11/21/2023
Did I hear correctly that it is the understanding that the Navy will be flushing two million gallons of our water forever indefinitely?,0,C2,11/21/2023
"I actually was not aware of their full plan. My understanding is their gag discharge right now still continues on. I don't know when they’re going to stop. The gag discharge right now is 5 million gallons per day, but I wonder if what you meant in terms of two million gallons per day flushing is from a different area and different mechanism.",0,C2,11/21/2023
"Oh no, the Navy said they were going to try to get it down to two million but I guess it's still five million a day so that's two billion and counting that they flushed into the stream. My comment to the Commission would be, we really need an answer from the Navy whether they're going to continue even five million or even two million or less a day indefinitely. I think we really need an answer from the Navy. That’s just not sustainable like I said before with the drought we're in and climate change. I do appreciate all the research that you did, thank you so much. Looks like it was a lot of hard work and analysis so I appreciate that.",0,C2,11/21/2023
"I know that the Navy, they were taking notes while they heard all the comments. Let's hope they respond to your comments as well.",0,C2,11/21/2023
That's mind-blowing that their solution is continue and if that is their solution even at two million gallons a day I would hope that this Commission would then decrease their allotment or their permit by two million gallons a day because we can't live like this on Oʻahu. Thank you.,0,C2,11/21/2023
"This is for our staff, Deputy Manuel and Dr. Strauch. Can you refresh my memory whether we granted the Navy permission to pump Red Hill at 5 mgd for the purpose of plume containment? Is that correct?",0,C2,11/21/2023
That's a groundwater question.,0,C2,11/21/2023
This is where we get confused because I'm seeing you and the stream but it is a groundwater question.,0,C2,11/21/2023
"Yeah I'll start, so the Commission didn't take an action to permit that use of water. Their water use permit is for Waiawa and in Red Hill the shaft itself was for their municipal system. So change in use from municipal to then using it as a remediation well to create this capture zone was something that was discussed by the Commission, but the Commission never acted on the water use permits of the Navy.",0,C2,11/21/2023
"Then I guess I have a question for Department of Health because it seems to lie in the space between the Commission and Department of Health on when that flushing will end. From my understanding of our last item, that is in the works.",0,C2,11/21/2023
"Yes, like I said we don't want to decrease it while they're defueling. Once it's defueled we are in active discussions how to address this after defueling.",0,C2,11/21/2023
"Thank you very much Dr. Tsang for your team's great work and the information. Encouraging but also managing expectations, it all depends.",0,C2,11/21/2023
Briefing on the Outcomes of the 2023-2024 Legislative Biennium Related to the Commission on Water Resource Management,0,C1,05/21/2024
"PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Deputy Dean Uyeno & Katie Roth, Planning Branch Chief",0,C1,05/21/2024
"Staff presented the outcome of bills related to the Commission during the 2023-2024 Legislative Biennium which included HB1800, HB1900, SB3327, and HB2690.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"I suspect there’s a greater will now, in light of Lahaina, that people may be motivated, government entities may be motivated if there’s a comprehensive plan, so good.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"If I can just make a comment to that, Chair Linda Ichiyama who’s head of Water and Land for the House side, she did have Kaleo at the beginning of the year do a, what was she calling it, like a lunch hour, but he did a presentation on the Hawaiʻi mesonet. I really do think having those kinds of opportunities to meet with the legislators about some of the initiatives that we’re working on makes a difference. We are encouraging all of our divisions to, where we can, whether they’re site visits or whether they’re training opportunities or providing them more information, but that really does seem to help with the legislators. I appreciate that effort and I think it resulted in the funding and Chair Ichiyama’s champion of, she’s been extremely helpful for DLNR.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"I seem to recall we had advanced consideration of the budget matters, that you brought them here under some briefing and that this is what was going to be in the budget and we see what we worked out. I don’t remember a Commission discussion of this matter and is it our role to consider these things when they’re in process, not like this after the fact and to help inform that position, Department takes?",0,C1,05/21/2024
You’re talking about the SB3327?,0,C1,05/21/2024
"Well, this one, the SB or did you want to do the Red Hill WAI?",0,C1,05/21/2024
"Well, both and it’s a general, it’s a broad question. There’s a specific case here a couple a couple bills here, but it’s the responsibility of the Commission to consider testimony on kind of the unplanned items that get introduced along the way. Do we weigh in at all on shaping the Commission’s position?",0,C1,05/21/2024
I should defer to Chair for that.,0,C1,05/21/2024
"I think once when we brought that to the Commission, those were administrative bills.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"Yeah, the budget as well as proposed legislation. These two were legislative initiatives so House-Senate Bill 3327 came from both Water Land, but Senator Inouye. I think this was in response to numerous things that happened over in the Maui wildfires, but it kind of morphed and we did bring this back to the Commission.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"We presented a more informational and that’s when I did ask, we did a legislative update. I had Dean prepare all the bills that were going through and this one Senate Bill 3327 and we did ask all the Commission. I think Neil, you were not here that day.",0,C1,05/21/2024
There was a discussion about Commissioners can as individuals testify.,0,C1,05/21/2024
"By himself but was the only one who had lodged, Larry’s on here, he can speak for himself, but had an objection to Senate Bill 3327 which more shaped my testimony as a chairperson because I was both support, comments and oppose and after having the opportunity to have the Commission weigh in on that, then I took a different...well we still provided comments, support, opposition but it was more in opposition to taking CWRM out of DLNR. House Bill 2690 and the Red Hill WAI did not come to the Water Commission because it was more of an initiative that was being driven, quite frankly it was a legislative initiative by the House and the Senate leadership. In light of Red Hill, DLNR was part of some discussions with various State agencies as well as the city to have a unified statement regarding Red Hill both the defueling and the remediation. The Red Hill WAI, the implementation was, this bill was designed to have capacity, three people out of the chairperson’s office that would help coordinate, establish a fund in anticipation that federal funds would be appropriated for the Red Hill remediation that they could be housed in this fund. It was also to implement some of the Red Hill initiatives and to help do the community outreach. That bill unfortunately it did die as a result of coming in and adding the Senate Bill 3327. We did come back and brief the Commission, but you’re correct, that is the meeting you were not here.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"I have a few questions, it’s mostly about the process. If I remember correctly, the Commission never had a position on these bills that were being introduced and that when we had that discussion, it was basically said while we can see on the website where these bills are going to go and that we could testify for, against, or comment on the bills as individual Commissioners. I’m okay with that, but I think that it’s an obligation of the Department that if there are bills coming up like that not to say, oh you guys can go to Legislature or look at their website and find out what’s going on. I think it’s an obligation to let us know what’s going on during the legislative process and that wasn’t there. The other thing I wanted to ask was clearly the bill that did all those changes, proposed changes for the Commission, was a result of people’s dissatisfaction with what happened in Lahaina, but who exactly introduced those bills? Do you have any idea? I’m sure you guys know where it came from.",0,C1,05/21/2024
It was Senator Inyoue who introduced the Senate bill.,0,C1,05/21/2024
"But who was the force behind that? I know some of the people that have been involved in Water Commission issues for years have voiced their dissatisfaction with how the Commission has operated. I think also with the advice we have been getting from the Attorney General’s office, in my experience over 25 years, you all know that I’m not really happy with the advice that we have gotten from the Attorney General’s office. I guess then what happened was that people went to various legislators and had them sponsor bills that were reflecting their positions, correct?",0,C1,05/21/2024
"That may be true, I don’t know. Senator Inouye was the champion of this bill. I don’t know who may have approached her or whether there were any special interests, but she was very...",0,C1,05/21/2024
All legislation is special interest.,0,C1,05/21/2024
I was going to say that’s standard practice for some.,0,C1,05/21/2024
"I don’t know, Larry, who may have.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"All I’m asking is that when we begin the legislative session again, don’t just give us a one-time update about what’s going on. I think that during the legislative session, every time we have a meeting, we should have a brief update about what’s going on and not leaving it to us as individual Commissioners to decide where we want to get involved or not.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"I as a follow up, our names as Commissioners are on the corner of everything that gets signed by staff, but I don’t feel that we always...that public meeting was more informational and it wasn’t necessarily an invitation. I’ll just say the complexity of the issue, it’s not always a comfortable space when we have the AG and Chair and if there is our dissenting views, to be honest about- the merits of these kinds of- to have a really honest and open discussion about that. I guess in the spirit of civic engagement, maybe we should.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"I think if I could make a request for next session it be that. Maybe it’s hard right? The legislation gets introduced in what, January? I mean the timing of it is hard.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"The best thing we can do is once...Michael Yoshinaga, he used to be with our office and was kind of the departmental legislative coordinator or was the departmental coordinator, retired at the end of last year. Because of that, all the divisions have been tasked to basically review all the bills themselves and identify which ones are relevant to their divisions. Thankfully we have Alexa who with her attorney background or law background, she’s very excited about the bills, but she did a great job in reviewing everything. After that, once we’ve reviewed it, we create a spreadsheet and then within our staff will identify who the lead branch is, basically, and then we’ll have a spreadsheet. I think the best thing we can do is provide that spreadsheet to you folks at the beginning of the session and get your feedback, recognizing that it is a very quick turnaround. Once Leg(islature) gets going, we only have sometimes 48 hours, 72 hours to turn around our testimony and even then the bill is changing, at times. I think the only opportunity we can really outreach to you folks is at the beginning, after that it’s very difficult to.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"Sorry, I interrupted you. Is that it? Thinking about the format of meetings and Sunshine, perhaps staff could solicit us individually for comments and take that in as you develop your Commission position, otherwise we would have to have it in full Sunshine. That could be really long and complicated, but just general comments. Is that a potential?",0,C1,05/21/2024
"The difficulty I have with that is if the Commission is going to take a position, in my mind it should be in an open discussion and we should all vote on it. Rather than putting the bill on the staff to try to decipher, okay some Commissioner saidv this. That’s a challenge. I think what we can try to do, I like Larry’s comment, included in all the agenda items, included information updates on legislation. Normally, probably starting August, the departments are beginning to come in with developing their administrative bills. As we develop our administrative bills, what we can do is have a meeting included in one of our Water Commission meetings proposed legislation. I think what we saw was the penalty bill was an important one, the other important one was emergency powers. If we’re going to do that because what I want to probably start June and I have initiated, is to have regular meetings with Dean and all of the County water directors and so that when we’re proposing a legislation, to give them an advanced warning. I don’t want us to come into the Leg(islature) where we’ve got the water departments at odds with us and that’s what we did for those two bills. They came in during the veto period and opposed us, so I think we want to start and we should be much more collaborative with the counties, as well. When we’re coming we can have a meeting maybe in July or August with the Commission to talk about proposed legislation, get the Commissioner’s input, staff can develop some draft administrative bills and then I think we can actually take a formal position on those as a Commission. Do we as a Commission support this so that when we testify because normally when we draft testimony, it’s really the chairperson of the Commission. But if we know that it’s the Commission that supports this, it can be taken at a publicly noticed meeting, the Commission supports this administrative bill. We won’t know what the non- administrative bills are until they’re actually introduced probably come January or February and then we can provide you an update. If the Commission feels that they can take a position on proposed legislation, we can do that, but I think procedurally we will try to include Commission, get some guidance from you on proposed legislation, get a Commission decision if one can be made, and then two, move forward with the legislative session in January as new bills get introduced that may affect the Commission or CWRM. We’ll include that as regular updates on our monthly meetings. Because Larry, what I have found at the Legislature, you got to show up, you got to be present and there are people who do show up. But it is helpful to have testimony written or oral testimony for various bills that we are trying to initiate. It’s very hard when the only person sitting, defending a bill is just the Department. I know that on the other hand, unless we keep the Commission informed or our stakeholders informed, not everybody may have the same sense of urgency as we do, so we’ll try to do a better job of keeping the Commissioners and our stakeholders informed of various proposed legislation.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"I think for the matters that we can as a Commission, as a body, really comment on, I think I would like to be able to collectively support those and publicly support those to ensure their success, especially if they’re really important for functioning. This sounds like a good plan to pregame a little bit and have those updates. Thank you.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"The reason I bring this up is that we have all these proposed significant changes going on and as far as us as individual Commissioners, we’re sort of like passive watchers and that’s kind of frustrating to be in that position. The other thing I wanted to ask was that we all know that bills get introduced, but it might take several years before certain ones get passed. It would be interesting to see what the Department’s assessment is of the ones in this legislative session that made it fairly far along but then never made it through. When do you expect them to be reintroduced again and just to give us a heads up again. The other thing is that maybe we should also have a discussion during Commission meetings well before the legislative session about whether there are certain issues that we as individual or collectively as Commissioners would like to see legislation introduced. I for one think there’s a lot of issues around designation of Water Management Areas that we really need to strengthen. Anyway, that’s my three cents [inaudible].",0,C1,05/21/2024
I’d like to respond to that.,0,C1,05/21/2024
"I’ll build on Larry’s point that we know these issues will be back, right? These are issues, like you say, these things, bills, concepts tend to have a multi-year gestation period so there should be no surprise when we see these again next year. The issue of fines, the issues of emergency powers, the issue of independence and so forth. Fostering some kind of healthy discussion not when you’re in the middle of the session and things are flying and bills are being moved around, but just a healthy discussion of this, I think at some advanced point would be a really good idea because it’s not going away.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"I agree. I see the role as a Commission, the Commission makes policy. Legislation is also part of policy. The role of CWRM is actually to implement the Commission’s policy, so I do think it is worthwhile for us as a Commission to have some of those conversations and to talk about what kinds of policy changes. Whether, as Larry talks about Water Management Areas or the administration of CWRM, to me those are policy discussions that we should have. In the absence of them, yes, the chairperson then represents the Commission, but it may not necessarily represent all of the Commission’s wishes. It would be helpful to have a discussion when we’re not at a point where we have to make a decision, but as you say sort of safe space to have open discussions about that.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"I’ll add this. This young lady came on board, she approached me at a conference and said if I had any advice for her. I said if you think of things as hard or challenging, they tend to self-fulfill, it becomes hard. To me, it’s not so much that these are hard discussions as they’re deep discussions, they’re philosophically important discussions. The whole issue of independence for instance is not so much about, we have a problem with you or this administration and so forth, it’s the idea that the protection of a public trust asset, people need to represent the unborn and not the current electorate. If this administration is going to stand up for the people who put them in office, which they should, we get that, but sometimes an asset like this can’t be managed to just the needs of this generation. That’s the philosophical discussion. It’s not a condemnation of anybody’s behaviors or motives and so forth, it’s just I think we would welcome that kind of deep philosophical discussion. What’s the right path, what’s the thing that takes care of the needs of today, but also adequately protects our future generations who aren’t voting today? They’re not putting this Governor or this legislator in office. I think that’s an important part of our duty, but that’s just me. Others may feel different.",0,C1,05/21/2024
I appreciate the discussion.,0,C1,05/21/2024
"I do want to applaud and recognize the efforts of Katie and Kaleo last year worked with our Congressional delegates in getting some additional funds for monitoring. I think that’s a source that we have not really fully tapped into, federal funding. I am encouraging all of our divisions to start looking at available federal funds to supplement monies that we get from the leg(islature). Any other questions? Anything else?",0,C1,05/21/2024
"Just a comment, I strongly support the greater collaboration with the Counties and the various public Departments of Water Supply and in particular, taking the time to be more involved in the formative process of legislation, as Larry recommended. I, for one, would be happy to devote the time to that and I think that’s a critical component of the mission and functioning as has been echoed by Neil, as well, that we do that going forward. It requires a personal commitment, perhaps even an executive session as opposed to more formal meetings with the complications involved, but I think that’s a very important function of this Commission and we should proceed to activate that, Chair.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Meyer. I hear a uniform voice of our water Commissioners supporting being more involved in legislation in a proactive way and being regularly updated. I have found that collaboration and keeping people informed is really critical to the success of all the work that we do. The water directors, they are a key component to some of the work that we do, so I am finding opportunities, having monthly meetings with all the water departments so we can update them on what we’re doing. They can update us with what they’re doing, but also talking about collaboration when we move into legislation rather than being at odds, being together, so addressing proactively their issues.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"I do have one question since we do need to work with counties, but because our mission is public trust, are we investing the same effort in communicating with a variety of stakeholders? I guess I just want to be cognizant of sometimes the utilities and public trust purposes are at odds, so just ensuring that we’re proceeding in ways that are going to not apparently say “fast track” permits, but really show that we’re doing our consideration of the multiple values. I’ll always just sort of prod at that, but I agree, we do need to be in coordination if we want to see our infrastructural improvements go forward.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"It’s also getting good information from them. They’re doing a lot of water development wells. What I’m finding is that there’s a gap between, we’re not finding opportunities to share information. For example, when we’re talking to Hawaiʻi Island about doing this regional monitoring system, we don’t know what they’re monitoring, they don’t know what we’re monitoring, so just trying to have government entities work more collaboratively so that we can, rather than either duplicating or find where are we missing gaps, to do better, to service the people better. Far from fast tracking anybody’s permit, it’s looking at how can we be more efficient with our limited resources by working together. We’re looking at the placement of new wells, is there a gap that they’re finding, so I think there is value in those kinds of conversations with the regulators who provide. But your comment is well taken that we shouldn’t only be having conversations in our Commission meetings, but I also see staff doing a lot of work in going out to the communities and the different plans that they’re coming up with.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"Not just because of optics, but when people are not in certain conversations, there can be constructions of explanations of what’s happening that are not reflective of what the dialogues are focused on. But I do know that the utilities know their systems and know their wells and that’s something we haven’t always been able to share on. I appreciate this dialogue about the broader needs.",0,C1,05/21/2024
"Update on Implementation of Waimea Watershed Agreement, Waimea, Kauaʻi",0,C2,04/16/2024
"Dr. Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Acting Branch Chief",0,C2,04/16/2024
Staff shared a brief update on the status of the Waimea Watershed Agreement which is yet to be accepted by all parties. Chair Chang present.,0,C2,04/16/2024
"Can you go back to the previous slide, please? Do you have a guess on how much water we took over this past weekend and do you have a survey on what’s left? Things like this I would think are at risk isn’t it?",0,C2,04/16/2024
Believe it or not this structure has survived pretty high flows and Waimea’s flows were not as substantial as Koloa relatively speaking or Wailua over the past weekend. I’ll let...or Hanapēpē.,0,C2,04/16/2024
"KAA (Kekaha Agriculture Association) has a camera on the system, so they should be able to know. I’ve been busy and I have not had a chance to reach out to see if their infrastructure is still in place. I’m sure they’ll be available to answer questions.",0,C2,04/16/2024
"I’ve got, are they here? Delanie and Josh.",0,C2,04/16/2024
Josh Uyehara is here from KAA.,0,C2,04/16/2024
"Good afternoon, Chair, members of the Commission, Josh Uyehara here with KAA. On that particular question, I would actually defer to Mike Faye who’s also on the Zoom, he’s our Executive Director.",0,C2,04/16/2024
"Thanks, Chair, and Commissioners. The question I think was asked was did that infrastructure survive this past weekend? Yes, it did, it’s operating well. One thing Ayron didn’t mention is that besides the CWRM and USGS monitoring stations, we monitor the flows also at some of these locations, not all of them. That gate that is in that last picture that you saw, we have monitoring devices on there, measurements that we can take at that gate, so we know how much water is going out or we think we know how much. We compare it against the CWRM number just to make sure we’re in sync. That survived. If you looked at that picture the water level basically came up to the that platform and the concrete structure over the intake screen and completely covered the whole bottom of the valley there. That happens about maybe half a dozen times a year.",0,C2,04/16/2024
"Just out of curiosity, how old are these systems? Josh, Mike, do you know?",0,C2,04/16/2024
"The original system was built in 1912 up there at Waihulu, the lower part in 1908. We installed that automatic gate about two years ago, three years ago.",0,C2,04/16/2024
"Let me just preface that. Commissioners, I know we had brought a stream diversion works permit application to you folks in January and that got deferred based on discussions that KIUC had proposed modifications to the diversions and installation of gaging equipment. With the withdrawal of the pump storage hydro project, you folks decided to defer that, so KAA, Kekaha Agriculture Association and Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative were going to meet together on that and the plan was to bring it back to you folks at this Commission meeting. However, last week when we met with the parties, they are still in discussions as far as costs, but you folks had also asked for a briefing just to see where we are at on the implementation of the mediation agreement. That’s why we asked Ayron to provide you folks that update. Dawn Huff is also here for KIUC along with their representative, Jordan Inafuku and they can have answer any questions we may have.",0,C2,04/16/2024

"Yes, when I was the founding dean of the School of Hawaiian Asian and Pacific Studies at UH Manoa, I was quite close to the Hawaiian community and had a role in preserving the last lo‘i in O‘ahu. Today if you go to the School of Hawaiian Studies, it's now split off from the school that I helped to found, you'll find the lo‘i still standing which I’m really quite proud. So, when my wife and I retired a couple years ago, we came to Maui. I wanted to have a place that we could kind of preserve some of the Hawaiian tradition of creating a bamboo house in Polynesian style which I don't live in. It's definitely a kind of retreat house. Actually, the only people living there now, are from Lāhainā because as you know we've had this horrible tragedy on Maui and so I've divided my place for evacuees at least for present. But most of it’s an orchard of papaya, of banana, of guava, lychee and the like, but I’d like to grow kalo also. The catchment system provides water for much of the, particularly during the rainy season, but I need water for kalo and then of course when it's very dry and the river is right there. All I’m proposing is that in times of necessity it would be an occasional use to put this temporary pump which is like a three foot pipe into the water for a couple hours and be able to fill up the catchment tank and then remove it so it would not be permanently in the water and that's my request: an occasional use of water using this temporary pump; primarily so I can grow kalo and have a small lo‘i on the site.",1,B4,08/15/2023
"Questions? Was that use considered, Dean, in the application? Lo‘i kalo? Okay.",1,B4,08/15/2023
"It was my understanding that there are appurtenant rights from the documents that I have that go back to Kamehameha the Fourth because at one time it was a Mahele with the, not for a village because it’s a kind of flood area from the river, but an area in which kalo was grown. So, I don't know whether the staff took that into consideration. That was my understanding.",1,B4,08/15/2023
MOTION: (MIIKE / MEYER) To approve staff recommendation. UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED. (MIIKE/KATAYAMA/HANNAHS/CHANG/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/HO/MEYER),1,B4,08/15/2023

"Submittal of Policies on Permitting Water Use Transfers for Agricultural Use Where the Transfer Entails a Division of Parcels of End Use, and Pump Replacements for Pumps Greater Than 27 Gallons Per Minute That Have Not Been Used For The Previous Four Years",1,B4,07/23/2024
Staff stated the summary of request that the Commission modify ground water permitting requirements in cases pertaining to agricultural uses.,1,B4,07/23/2024
"I have a comment from Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani. She says, one, she supports more tracking of old wells where pumps haven't been used. We need to think about culling uses as we face future water scarcity, and two, I think Ryan has already addressed the recommendation, please clarify that Recommendation #2 applies to both water management areas and non-water management areas.",1,B4,07/23/2024
I can amend that in the actual or maybe we can amend that in the recommendation.,1,B4,07/23/2024
"Thank you, Chair. Ryan, how is the capacities for inactive pumps factored into the sustainable yield calculation?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"The capacity in the sustainable yield. We actually track pumpage in aquifer systems by the actual pumpage. I know that sometimes there's some correlation between a pump capacity and pumping at 24-hours a day. We generally don't factor in the idea that somebody will pump 24-hours a day in calculating out sustainable yield, but we do regularly track how much is being withdrawn from an aquifer at any given time. I think your question is pertaining to aquifer protection as the way that we look at things. But again, it's not just pump capacities, we look at deep monitor well data, we're looking at water levels, we're looking at salinity, we're looking at profiles in terms of the groundwater levels and then the top of the transition zone from fresh / salt water midpoint. I'm sorry, going a little bit beyond your question, but looking at aquifer health from just the perspective of pumpage is just one facet of it. We're also looking at aquifer profiles, so in that sense we don't look at 24-hour pumpage of pump capacities in terms of evaluating what are going to be the impacts to sustainable yield overall. I hope that answers your question.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"But how does that correlate when you issue water reservations in an aquifer because that's inactive, basically. And there’s no sunset on those.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"On the reservations, yeah. I think that reservations might be looked at a little bit differently between management areas and non-management areas because in a management area, regardless of your pump capacity, you'll have an allocation and you have to limit the pumpage to that allocation. In that case, instantaneous pump capacities, what I mean by that is gallons per minute, we don't look at as much as we look at the actual allocations.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"If someone were just to reactivate a pump, would that fall under this four-year sunset?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"That's a good question, I guess we should amend that. Here's one situation that I see. In Pāʻia, Mahi Pono has these 5,000, and I don't want to pick on anybody, but they have these 5,000 gallon permitted pumps that have been non- operational for a long time and they want to replace those pumps. Now, I'm looking at it from the lens of, I don't know how long they're going to pump and it's not a management area. If they put 5,000 gpm (gallons per minute) pumps and they pump them for 24 hours a day, that's going to far exceed the 8 mgd (million gallons of water) sustainable yield. That's the reason why I want to bring the replacement to the Commission, but your comment is a good one, if it's just reactivating a pump. I just don't know what regulatory mechanism we have for somebody that's reactivating a pump. Maybe that's something the Commission can discuss is if you're reactivating a pump, what permits are required. I don't know because well and pump permits, they're issued for one point in time. It doesn't imply that you can use a well or it's issued to the driller and the driller gets a permit to install a well, install a pump and then beyond that, the landowner has a correlative right to use the well and the pump the way that they see fit. I think there are opportunities for us to revisit those things. I don't want to say it's a slippery slope, but then where do you think in terms of when people have in a non-management area, have a pump capacity, and then want to ramp up pumpage to 24 hours a day versus three hours a day. It’s a difficult thing to address, I'm just hoping that in this submittal I can address some of the issues that we're facing and again this is for transparency. I don't want to delegate things to the Commission where I think that there are questions that come up. Again, with respect to the agricultural subdivision issue, I've been getting some comments from the public saying that, hey you're transferring this water use permit from one guy to another guy, but we don't think that they're good stewards of water. In the transfer I want to make sure that there's due process and that there's opportunity for a better process. Again, I will say that that's a great concern that you raised, Commissioner Katayama and we'll try to address that issue.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Part of it was answered, but if you have a pump insulation permit in a water management area, you also have to get a permit for withdrawal and if it's non-use, we can say you've abandoned the use and we withdraw the permit. Now in the non-management area, don’t we have authority for abandonment of wells?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Or non-use, yeah. I think that we can require somebody to abandon a well if it's not being used.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"We have that authority, the question is how long it has to go before there is an abandonment, but can’t we just sort of notify people that if we see they haven't done anything with the well, after four years can't we just send them a notice that we're going to start processing an abandonment of well unless you come back with information?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Then even in non-management areas, once they put in a pump, don't we follow what they pump?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Yeah, we track. As long as they're reporting their water use, we're tracking what they're pumping. We can certainly implement a program whereby if somebody doesn't pump for a certain period of time, we can require them to abandon the well.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"So, we have authority to do those things already, right?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Oh, yeah. As you noted in the first or second submittal, the Commission has broad authority for a lot of things, but I think we have stronger standing to require somebody to abandon a well. We prioritize abandonment of wells where there's a potential for contamination. I think that's our first priority.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Larry, your comments and Ryan, your comments are appropriate. I think following the situation and allowing the well owner, landowner, farmer, user of the land some flexibility to explain their actions is valid and appropriate. Farming, as you guys know, can have longer periods of pre-productivity where new plants across hundreds or even more acreage may need to be raised in a greenhouse or developed in controlled conditions and they don't actually reach the point of being productive in terms of their full capacity and need for water until 5 years, 8 years down the road. Those are circumstances that I would think it would be in the best interest of the Commission and the public to accommodate those, provided they’re explained and provided staff has a chance to understand that and make those allowances accordingly.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"That's the reason why my proposal is to take it to the Commission because there's a lot of perception that staff has too much discretion in making decisions about these things. Where there's the opportunity to explain things, I want them to explain it not to me, well they do explain it to me in my submittal, but they explain it to the full Commission and the Commission makes the decision rather than staff making the decision.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"That's certainly great, Ryan. Thank you.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Ryan, my question is and I'm not as familiar with the abandonment process, but is there a notice requirement and a due process? So, someone has a permit and even if they're not using it, before we decide to change the terms of that, are we required to put people on notice that if you don't use it for four years?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"A couple things, I think the first thing is if we're talking about management area versus non-management area, there's two questions right - your allocation and your requirement to abandon and seal the well. Regarding the allocation, there's clearly a process spelled out and that is in 174C-58 where it says that if you don't use water for a period of four or more years, a Commission can permanently revoke your permit, but I think it's subject to a hearing.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"After a hearing, one, they have to be given notice and then a hearing.",1,B4,07/23/2024
174C-58 doesn't apply to non-management areas because these are for water use permit applications.,1,B4,07/23/2024
"So, your recommendation that, “has not been used for four years shall require...even if the pump installation is less.” I'm just wondering do you have to put everybody on notice first and give them an opportunity to? I guess I'm just wondering, are you planning to put all of these users on notice that you haven't been using it?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"No, I'm sorry, I think that there's some confusion. I wasn't clear enough, so I apologize in my submittal. When I talked about partial or total non-use, I wasn't talking about revoking anybody's use, I was using that as an example just to frame the time period with which we look at things that are not being used. My recommendation is for pump replacement. If somebody wants to replace a pump, again I'll cite the Department of Water Supply example, if they're pumping a well continuously and the pump goes down and at the Department of Water Supply on the Big Island, Keith Okamoto can speak more to this than I can, but I think pumps go down and it takes them some time to get it back up. They might not have had continuous pumpage for six months or 12 months or whatever while they get a contractor in place and they order the pump and they do all of that stuff. Just thinking about those kinds of delays, I don't want to add the permitting as a delay in addition to that because what I think is that pumping that quantity isn't really changing the aquifer. It's not going to impact anything significantly. I was just saying that for replacements, if it's greater than 27 gallons per minute and it hasn't been used for four years, you just need to get a permit from us. I'm not going to do a wholesale evaluation of every well that has greater than 27 gpm, and I think that's a discussion for another day. Dr. Miike and Commissioner Katayama's concerns, I'll think about that and think about a subsequent action that we can propose to address those kinds of things.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Okay, thank you for that clarification. I misunderstood the presentation.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Ryan, you can look at all these pumps that have been installed and you know whether they're pumping anything at all.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"All I'm saying is that after about four years or more, you can just send them a notice saying, we're going to consider this an abandoned well unless you respond and tell us why not. What we're doing is giving them notice that they should come back and let us know.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Yeah, I think that's a great idea.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"I feel uncomfortable with all of these wells out there with pump permits and they're not doing anything and then at any time, they can start doing.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"I agree with that, too. That does appear to be in support of what Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani said. Is that possible to add that to the recommendation, Ryan, or do you want to handle that in a different way?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"This is just related to permitting. I feel that those are very legitimate things that we need to address, but number one, I think the AGs can opine, that we didn't notice that particular discussion, so I don't feel comfortable about making a recommendation that we didn't notice to get the proper feedback. I would propose, let's look at that as something as a separate action so that we can notice that publicly and then we can get stakeholder input and do more research into it.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Wait, I don't see why we need to get a formal declaration about how we're going to do that. All I'm saying is that we can just say, look you haven't used your well in X number of years. Come back and tell us why, if you don't tell us we're going to consider starting a process of abandoned wells. I don't see why we need to have a formal decision on that, that's already in the code.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"I would agree with that, Ryan. It seems an operational issue, not a policy and that one that you can implement, but I think it is appropriate to inventory and put people on notice before we take any formal action. It is a good idea to inventory and monitor these.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"If you look at my last submittal, given the amount of things that we have to do. I agree it's a great idea, implementation-wise it detracts from the other things that we need to do. I agree it's important and I think that we need to look at it and maybe another thing that we can do is we can brief the Commission on some of the things that we're looking at in terms of... We have, I don't think Katie (Roth) is here anymore, but we have a programmatic agreement with the Department of Health looking at possibly having an abandoned well program.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"She's in the room, Ryan.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"I can't see the room, so I thought she had to leave at 10. Maybe we can do a briefing to the Commission on that and look at that, but I agree, it's an important thing to implement.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"We're not, at least I'm not asking you to do it right away. I'm just saying that we should start doing something like for example if you get a summer intern, that intern can go look at all these well permits and see what's going on in that. I'm not saying prioritize this way up, I'm just saying we should start thinking about it and start doing something about it.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Or you can get an AI (artificial intelligence) to go through all your files. I chuckle, but I suspect there might even be a program that could go through...that's far beyond this agenda item.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Ryan, number 1 - transfer of existing groundwater permits for ag. I don't know how many transfers you have, but in certain programs within the Department of Health what we do in the permit itself, we say that the permit is only good for the permittee and that if they're going to transfer, they have 90 days to notify us. I'm just concerned that if it all requires approval of the Commission, if you don't give a time frame that we're going to have, again I don't know how many of these transfers you have, but we could have a lot that has to come to the Commission.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Sorry, I'm trying to understand the question.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"In the Department of Health, we have permits that we issue and we say the permit is only good for the permittee and if they want to transfer the permit to someone who's buying the operation, they have to notify the Department within 90 days of the transfer and that gives us an opportunity to review the new application. If this transfer is going to happen and it has to come to the Commission, my concern is that if you don't give a time frame in which these transfers have to notify the Commission and that they have to come before the Commission, that we might get backed up.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"That's a good question. I will note that in 174C-59, the State Water Code, the new landowner is required to be informed of the transfer within 90 days, so I think that echoes what...",1,B4,07/23/2024
"It just doesn't say it in the submittal, that's all.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Is that a standard condition? Land Division for 171 permits, there are standard terms and conditions, any transfer, any assignment requires notification. Is there some things that you can rather than getting Commission approval that it is part of your standard terms and conditions of the permit?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"The reason why I want them to be presented to the Commission, again I will cite that situation or I'll cite situations where there's a transfer of the water use permit. Say it's to a previous big agricultural user like Del Monte or Wailua Sugar or Dole or whatever and it's being transferred to a purveyor that's then going to provide water to a use that's not necessarily the same. I'll say that in some cases there may be transfers of use from pineapple to gentleman estates and I think those are opportunities - again I'm trying to take the discretion out of staff's ability to say that if it's going to be used for a different type of use that's agriculture, but not quite agriculture that we present it to the Commission for approval. The Commission can say, well we approve this transfer or we don't approve this transfer. Then maybe the action is that the Commission says, well you got to apply for a new water use permit because the use is not the same, in other words rendering that [174]C-59 Condition 1 not applicable, that's what I'm saying.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Commissioners, if I may. Ryan, correct me if I'm wrong, the transfers are typically handled ministerially, is that correct?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Yeah, again that's why I'm trying to take it out of staff’s hands.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Ryan cites 174C-59 that states the Commission is informed of the transfer or should be informed of the transfer within 90 days. The recommendation only speaks to the approval of those transfer requests, that certain ones we want to bring to the Commission for approval versus the rest would be handled ministerially.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"What I can say, too, is that part of the Code says, “a permit may be transferred in whole or in part from the permittee to another.” It's saying that it can be, but I'm trying to frame it under this lens that the Commission staff and the Deputy doesn't have the ultimate power to make decisions about how things happen, rather I think it goes to the Commission so the Commission can make those decisions. It's the loophole that I'm seeing in our process that allows us to approve gentlemen estates. I'm just saying it plainly or any agricultural use where the agricultural use is different from the previous agricultural use and I don't see the same quantity of water being necessary for the new use. That's what I'm saying.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"I know that, Ryan, you're trying to find this really nice balance between transparency, objectivity, what comes before the Commission, what's discretionary versus what's ministerial. It's always a hard balance to find.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Ryan, has the Department of Ag(riculture) had any comments to this? Have they been aware of this?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"I don't know if they're aware of it, but I haven't received comments on it.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"I'll make one comment. Series of Supreme Court decisions have said that when we permit agriculture uses, we have to be basically crop specific, now. You can't just sort of say “agriculture,” you can't just say because sugar used to be about 7,000 gallons an acre. Pineapple is maybe 1,200 and so that's a big range. At least when we say about change in use, it should reflect what we do under the Supreme Court directive. Agriculture is not just a uniform number.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Thank you for that, that's exactly how I feel and I think that it's the Commission's responsibility to make sure that where these transfers are happening that again, we apply our evaluation specific to what kind of agricultural use it is. As an example, I'll cite Kunia where they converted from pineapple. I was out there looking at the pineapple fields in the very beginning and then now it's all seed corn and it's all different types of crops. I think it's important for us to have the ability to look at what you said in terms of the Supreme Court mandate, for us to look more specifically at crop specific water requirements where these transfers are happening.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Ryan, does the Department of Ag(riculture) have a criteria for water use of different crops? Do they have a standard?",1,B4,07/23/2024
"I believe they do, but I think that in establishing what water duties are and maybe Neal is on the call, maybe he can answer this more. He has more knowledge about this, but I think that they use a certain set of calculations to determine what they need in terms of long-term use of water. We're looking more in terms of allocating water for a very specific period so that we can have equity across all the water use permits that we issue and it's basically looking at a one and five-year drought period and it's using our IWREDSS program to look specifically at root depths. We look at isohyets to determine rainfall, we look at rain gages to determine evaporation and we have a specific set of circumstances that looks at calculating water uses. DOA (Department of Agriculture) uses more long-term projection for what kind of water uses are necessary.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"I think the Supreme Court decisions, especially when we were looking at the Waiāhole and the use of Larry Jefts and those farmers, said you had to be specific for a crop in a particular area because they change so much. The DOA budgets for crops are basically generic, they got corn, whatever else, and it don't consider where they're growing that stuff, whereas ours do.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Also Ryan, it's seasonal because in the summer where you can, rates are higher, you need more water. If you take an average of, let's say 1,000 gallons per acre, you may use none of it in the winter. It may use double of that during the summer, that's the way it goes. The other issue is the efficiency of your system, we always talk about where is the water being measured at? Is it top of field or is it at top of delivery system, diversion? Then you have to comprehend the efficiency of the system.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Definitely, I think that brings into consideration two things, maybe we need to think about doing a briefing to you guys regarding how we use the IWREDSS program - that's the program that was developed in conjunction with the University of Hawaiʻi to help us assess if somebody's application for water use for agricultural uses is appropriate.",1,B4,07/23/2024
It's a good program.,1,B4,07/23/2024
"Maybe I need to or staff needs to brief you...our surface water guys use it, too, and I think it'll illustrate to you guys that we do accommodate the seasonal variability, we accommodate different irrigation types, and as Dr. Miike said, it's very place specific. We're looking at rainfall isohyets, we're looking at pan evaporation, we're looking at all of that data in order to come up with that calculation and also projecting it out long-term to account for a one in five-year drought scenario, to accommodate for the rainfall. It might be a good opportunity for us to reinforce some of the things that we do in terms of how we arrive at the calculation. I will tell you that regarding system efficiencies and system loss, we do account for that in terms of the actual irrigation. If you're using overhead sprinklers versus drip irrigation, it requires a different quantity of water. But we're not looking at system losses in terms of what you said, assessing at the source or assessing at the end-use. I know Neal doesn't like to use percentages as system losses, but what if you have 20% system loss or 50%? It was accommodated and Dr. Miike knows that system losses were accommodated in Waiāhole in terms of the Commission issuing an allocation for system losses. I can't speak for the surface water side of it, but I do know that that's the only groundwater situation in which we did incorporate system loss into the equation and maybe that's something that we need to look at further. Your comments are well taken.",1,B4,07/23/2024
"Modification of Stream Channel Alteration Permit (SCAP.6026.3), Scaffolding for Reconstruction of Pedestrian Bridges Mauka of Kamehameha Highway and Installation of Temporary Pedestrian Bridges Makai of Kamehameha Highway; and Revised Recommendation from State Historic Preservation Division, Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation (DOT), Kamehameha Highway Resurfacing, Laiewai to Waipuhi Bridge, Hauʻula and Maakua Streams, Oʻahu, Tax Map Key(s): DOT Right-of-Way",1,B3,01/30/2024
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Deputy Director Dean Uyeno,1,B3,01/30/2024
Staff stated the summary request which is to approve the modification of SCAP.6026.3 with revised recommendations from SHPD.,1,B3,01/30/2024
I did ask CWRM to ask SHPD (State Historic Presevation Division) to be available because the modification is primarily due to a changed position from SHPD.,1,B3,01/30/2024
"Madam chairman, board members it’s great to be here, see your faces again. My name’s Merania Kekaula and I’m from the Mermaids. It’s just a swimming group, we do it for our health, we do ancient Polynesian and so it’s very important at Kokololio Beach. It’s important to us to make sure our environment is kept pristine, and we have a legacy to leave our children, grandchildren. It’s with a lot of concern that I’m here in a good way. I mean it’s not a lot of concern but there are just issues that have cropped up because of the bridge. Is that the bridge we’re at now we’re doing?",1,B3,01/30/2024
This is for the Hauʻula and Maʻakua Stream bridges.,1,B3,01/30/2024
"Right and there are like about seven or eight bridges that will be reconstructed, yes. We’re wondering why the original SCAP, stream channel alteration permit was then changed and modified whereas why couldn’t that have been done in the planning stage in the original SCAP? What we’ve seen is a lot of adverse reaction, things that have happened as a result of this modification. The first, I’ll just go into them briefly, is the unearthing of the area right next to the stream where those two homes were, I take it those were the two homes that were removed.",1,B3,01/30/2024
Are you on this particular agenda?,1,B3,01/30/2024
That would be a question for DOT.,1,B3,01/30/2024
"Okay, so what there is then there’s this huge dirt area and right next to the stream and we’re just praying that it doesn’t rain so hard. I mean we want the rain, but we’re concerned that it may just fall into the stream if flooding occurs. That’s one issue, the other issue that is of concern to us is the wildlife and the area of the environment that it cuts across, this spot of land is home to our turtles and our monk seal. Hauʻula is famous for because they always have this monk seal coming down and the areas are built up enough as it is, so we want as little disturbance for the sea creatures as possible. We’re concerned about the amount of chemicals, and I know you have programs to stop the chemicals from seeping into the ground around the area as well as the stream. I looked at the sausage bags you have and things to alleviate turbidity and things like that but we’re thinking of pathogens, we’re thinking of chemicals that you can’t see that get into the water and that are carried out to the ocean and into the environment. That coast along Hauʻula, it’s an area because Hauʻula/Kahuku that is on top of an aquifer. It has little pockets deep in the ocean and freshwater bubbles out and it’s cold. There’s a lot of good stuff there that we don’t want to see harmed.",1,B3,01/30/2024
"This is for the stream channel alteration permit for the scaffolding, right? On Hauʻula Bridge?",1,B3,01/30/2024
"They’ve already taken down the original bridge, haven’t they?",1,B3,01/30/2024
"That’d be a question for DOT. Again, this is just for the scaffolding.",1,B3,01/30/2024
They’re moving the scaffolding from the mauka side for the pedestrian bridges and then they’re going to move it. Is this the same project?,1,B3,01/30/2024
"This is the same project, but we’re just concerned about the big vehicles and how they say if there’s any seepage it’ll be taken like 100 yards down the road and away from the site. Well 100 yards down the road is still the area affected, the environment. We’re very concerned about that as I said. I did want to say also that I don’t know how many times we cross that bridge during the day, my husband does a lot he works out that way, but the makeshift bridge is very narrow, and we’re concerned as to how long the actual project of this bridge, just this bridge will take. Now it says sometime during April or May this year? No, was that next year it’s going to be completed? We were concerned is it just that bridge or is it the entire bridges that will be finished by it says 2025 May?",1,B3,01/30/2024
"Ms. Kekaula, we have DOT here and they’re the project proponent so I’m going to ask because we’re not proposing the project, we’re actually just granting the permit. I’m going to ask you to summarize. I’ll then have DOT come up to respond to some of your questions.",1,B3,01/30/2024
Great. We’re concerned about that area and the strips that run along on either side of the bridge. It’s causing havoc because they’re ill-placed and they cause damage to the underneath of your car as well as wear and tear on the tires. That’s why we’re concerned as to when that particular project will be finished and if they can pull them up.,1,B3,01/30/2024
"I just wanted to get some clarification on the project in question because we have not started construction and our project is a resurfacing project and so the pedestrian bridge improvements are just for two of the bridges within our limits. With regard to concerns about damage to the environment, we are implementing best management practices and incorporating it into our plans and specifications to mitigate that.",1,B3,01/30/2024
"I understand it the Water Commission had previously approved this request. It’s now coming back, it’s a modification that you are moving the pedestrian bridge from the mauka side to the makai side. Temporary, is yours the repaving or is yours the construction?",1,B3,01/30/2024
It’s a resurfacing project that part of the scope also includes replacing the pedestrian bridges.,1,B3,01/30/2024
DOT has looked at this recommendation of staff including the incorporations of the need to have community meetings in alignment with DHHL’s concerns as well as best management practices with DOFAW’s concerns. You’re okay with the recommendation?,1,B3,01/30/2024
"SHPD reviewed the project. We raised concerns about the presence of cultural resources and potentially burials within what their calling the area of potential effects, primarily on the makai side. We consulted with HDOT and Federal Highways regarding our concerns and the different agencies agreed, one that they would put interim protection measures where there are known sites to try and make sure that those areas are not impacted and that there would be some architectural documentation of the bridge before there was some modifications and that there would also be archaeological monitoring to ensure that if anything was impacted or identified during the actual construction that it could be documented and mitigation could occur. That was our letter, I believe it was in July of 2022.",1,B3,01/30/2024
"Your original determination was no historic properties affected, but the modification does acknowledge that there. Is that based upon you did some additional consultation or?",1,B3,01/30/2024
"We did additional due diligence on our end and then again, we consulted further with HDOT and Federal Highways.",1,B3,01/30/2024
"When we approved the permit the first time, we recommended DHHL’s note that DOT should reach out to neighborhood board. Has that already been done or is there a planned date at which this will be presented just to make people aware of the project and that the precaution is being taken.",1,B3,01/30/2024
"that has not occurred, yet. CHAIR CHANG: Are you going to do that?",1,B3,01/30/2024
"If there’s a date, that would be great and I just say this especially with SHPD doing this kind of due diligence, it would sort of show that DOT is aware and has anticipated and prepared to have monitors on site. I think that could allay some of the community concerns that may come up as they see construction activities in the area.",1,B3,01/30/2024
"My recollection, I believe Cy Bridges lives across the street. I think Cy Bridges lives mauka and they have found burials on that site, so I appreciate the due diligence. I thought I had raised a concern when we first had this matter, so I appreciate the fact that SHPD went back and did some additional discussions with DOT and that DOT has revised its plan.",1,B3,01/30/2024
MOTION: (HANNAHS / KATAYAMA),1,B3,01/30/2024
To approve staff recommendation as submitted.,1,B3,01/30/2024
"Legislative update presented by Deputy Manuel on legislative bills, budget, and CIP",0,C2,05/16/2023
"Kaleo, where are we on commissioner tenure? Any vacancies and do we need resolutions? Is somebody going off soon.",0,C2,05/16/2023
"yes, Commissioner Buck’s term ends next month. Next month will be his last commission meeting. His position has been filled by Dr. Larry Miike; he will be rejoining the comission in July 2023. He has been selected by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate and will serve another four-year term.",0,C2,05/16/2023
this is Michael with comments. The Board of Water Supply really just focused on consultation or were they more deeper than that?,0,C2,05/16/2023
"There were concerns raised about the bill potentially circumventing the authority of the Governor under 127a regarding the declaration of emergencies. In our testimony, we explained that our goal is not to bypass the Governor’s authority but to have the ability, similar to the Department of Health’s regulation of water quality, to address water quantity issues. Even during a declared emergency, we would work collaboratively with the Governor as a state agency and develop specific orders to address the emergency. The commission, with its expertise in water resources, would provide guidance on these orders. It’s important to note that there can be confusion between the Board of Water Supply and the commission, but we have an obligation to all water users in the state and take a comprehensive view of the situation. Concerns were also raised about the lack of criteria for issuing an emergency, but the definition in the code explicitly states that an emergency can be declared when there is insufficient quantity or quality that affects public health and safety. The decision to declare an emergency would be made by the Commission as a whole, and the process would include transparency and public input. This is how we intended to propose and draft the bill, ensuring due process and inclusivity for all stakeholders.",0,C2,05/16/2023
well done Kaleo and team. Do we have the capacity to accept philanthropy?,0,C2,05/16/2023
"so, have we thought about that at all. Is there any bandwidth, to think about some of the sources we might tap to give a significant gift to take care of a precious resource.",0,C2,05/16/2023
"we're open to it. I haven't been able to strategize or come up with the time really to frame; what is the ask? We definitely know the budget needs. I think the closest we've focused on is the freshwater council with Hawaii Community Foundation. And it's not necessarily us accepting the philanthropic support, but it's really to support others in the community. Whether water purveyors or private agricultural just becoming better stewards. That sometimes is even better if it's given out that way rather than it come directly to the Water Commission as a state agency. We oftentimes have more strings than anything else to accomplish that ultimate goal. Before I continue, I want to mahalo staff and our Branch Chiefs and our legislative team Michael Yoshinaga, Neal Fujii, Alexa, our legal fellow, all our branches Ryan, Katie, and Dean as well as Ayron really put in the time this session to kind of get us to where we're at. So, it takes a team to get there but Katie's been the lead now that she's been on the team to really help us look at Federal funding. We have a good chance we're going to get quite a substantial amount of federal funding from support from our entire Congressional Delegation this year. We are waiting for the final budget to kind of get through. But this will be helping us, we'll be able to leverage our de monitoring well CIP with federal funds to basically double almost triple down on our resources. And then to help support us in other water audit and well abandonment programs. So that's really where I think our core is versus philanthropic funding.",0,C2,05/16/2023
"but on the philanthropic, there's a big push; migration from just funding- worthy activity to funding impact and transformation. You can't know your impact if you're not measuring. So, when we think about some of the gauging and the expense of putting in that system, maintaining it, getting the data, and analyzing it. There might be some room there so just a thought.",0,C2,05/16/2023
I will welcome your expertise in the philanthropic center on how best maybe we could approach that.,0,C2,05/16/2023
happy to chat with you and the team about it and connect with some other people who know.,0,C2,05/16/2023
"The Green fee introduced by the governor is aimed at creating a vehicle for philanthropic donations. Despite having exceeded expectations in many ways, the DLNR faced capacity limitations. The legislators showed increased understanding of DLNR’s challenges and were generous in allocating funds to DLNR in the budget bill. The Water Commission has emphasized the need for better coordination between government agencies and entities. A unified statement of support for the cleanup of Red Hill and the assurance of clean, fresh water for the future was issued by the governor’s office, legislative leadership, and the City and County of Honolulu. A collective body of government representatives has been formed to hold the Navy accountable and develop strategies for addressing cleanup and future water sustainability. The Governor’s Water Council, consisting of representatives from various agencies, including the Department of Health, Department of Agriculture, and Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, is working on water-related issues statewide. The Hawai‘i Community Foundation’s Water alliance, with representation from Kaleo and myself, is involved in water-related initiatives. Monthly meetings with Ernie Lau and his team, facilitated by Kaleo and I, will focus on discussing water issues. There is a growing recognition among government stakeholders, including the legislature,governor’s office, and City and County of Honolulu, about the need for better coordination and collaboration on water management. The vulnerability and fragility of Hawai‘i’s water resources, highlighted by the Red Hill incident, necessitate collective action and a departure from isolated approaches. The Water Commission’s advocacy and the efforts of the staff have been instrumental in pushing for better control and coordination. The aim is to prevent incidents like Red Hill from occurring again and to be better prepared for natural disasters or storms that could expose vulnerabilities in the water system. Mahalo to the Water Commission and the CWRM staff for stepping up and shedding light on a lot of the issues.",0,C2,05/16/2023
as presented in the workload of some of the legislative initiatives. As you increase your staffing to comprehend all the duties that need to be accomplished. Will you continue to be O‘ahu-centric? It seems that a lot of the work is outside of that.,0,C2,05/16/2023
"you're absolutely right. As a matter of just policy and leadership here at DLNR I am really trying to empower our Island staff. We are being criticized by the community for being O‘ahu-centric. I have told all our Island staff whether your land division, DOFAW, DOBAR, or DAR. I'm trying to get everybody out of silos. Whenever an issue comes up, we are triaging with all of the different divisions so that everybody is putting in their mana‘o. But at the same time trying to build capacity within our neighbor Islands as well. We learned that through covid we have to have capacity on each of these islands to support us. So, we are trying consciously to build that capacity on each of the islands so that we are supporting each other. I'm also trying to do multiple within the divisions. When an issue comes up how can we share information resources; knowledge to be much more effective?",0,C2,05/16/2023
"the Aquatic biologists that we talked about; two of them will be on Maui with the workload that Ayron shared and the amount of stream work that we do have on Maui, that'll be the first CWRM shift out of Honolulu. Which I will say is a culture shock for an institution that's only been O‘ahu Central. So, I am working with staff to make sure that we have the communication in place, the support system is built. But like other divisions that do have base yards outside of O‘ahu, is to really look outward. Another thing that we're looking at is as we start to onboard or look at options maybe even for some of the planners or compliance people if we can actually recruit from the outer islands where there is a need for more jobs and provide teleworking which is now kind of an option that's evolved in post-covid as an incentive. To get and recruit really good quality staff because some people don't want to be on O‘ahu they want to stay in Kauai or Maui or a big island, we're still working through the complexities of DHRD and our HR process to make that happen but yes, I am having coming from the neighbor Island we are looking at ways to provide a diverse kind of approach to our management and regulation. So, yes.",0,C2,05/16/2023
"we spend a significant amount of our time on litigation, which includes case hearings and court sessions. Our leadership team, Kaleo, Laura Ka‘akua, and I will be going out to each of the islands doing listening to sessions and really trying to engage with the community. We’re trying to be more proactive and develop that trusting relationship. I know a lot of community members don’t trust DLNR and I think the trust comes through physically being present by going into these communities and listening to what their issues are. I’m hoping that time that we spend will develop trusts and likewise, we’ll have commensurate reaction. Response with lessening the amount of time doing litigation I’m hoping we will be able to channel some of that energy into something more productive.",0,C2,05/16/2023
"I'm happy to give you some free advice. I've worked with seven different DLNR chairs looked at a lot of organizations. But you have some divisions that have regional authority where their staff is at a level where they're both responsible to make decisions on the island; you have other divisions that are very Honolulu-centric, and things need to go back. So, I'm happy at any time to give you some structures of potential. And I know reorganizations are just horrible. I've been through in my share, but to really manage the island so you can break down the silos between the divisions. There are some personnel reorganizations in certain divisions that that's not how they're aligned, it's not their history, that's not how they make decisions, and I think there's some real opportunities there I'm happy to offer you some free advice on your request. Thank you.",0,C2,05/16/2023
you were speaking from your larger broader DLNR perch but from the Water Commission standpoint. Do we have any active litigation right now?,0,C2,05/16/2023
"We have current contested cases that you've approved. We haven't started that process a lot of it is timing and working with AGs. The Land Board takes up a lot of the contested case capacity. We don't have much, and we've been really trying our best to walk through and walk with the community and applicant. And in the regulation and stewardship of resources so right now I think there are only two pending plus we have appeals of former contested cases.",0,C2,05/16/2023
two pending plus we have appeals of former contested cases that we are defending in the appellate courts. And there's the land division water RPS but those are not your kuleana.,0,C2,05/16/2023
"just off the top of my head. The Wailuku water company, Pale‘a‘ahu waste that's in a contested case. There’s the Kawela IIFS that is pending us coming back to the commission to either Grant or deny a contested case; there's a petition for that. And then there is technically the Ota Well, that was the Kona well, contested case petition. So, there are two petitions that we have to bring back to the commission with some kind of resolution or actions or next steps but that would be the only three at this point that are pending, and then the Nā Wāi ‘Ehā appeal so that would be four judicial types of processes that we'll be engaging in.",0,C2,05/16/2023
"well, it feels like the nature of the issues that we're involved with, it could be a lot more. I really want to credit the staff and Chair Chang. You mentioned that people don't trust us; people trust Ayron. I mean we hear that all the time, he’s out there in the field and so forth and we get a lot of good feedback on his work so I'm optimistic that as we have more neighbor island representation by our team, things will fall in line, and we'll avoid these contentious and expensive and delays of contested case and all this litigation and so forth.",0,C2,05/16/2023
you guys have done a lot of really good work here to sort of address a lot of those community concerns. I think having a lot of the community engagement process has also helped with respect to the Water Commission lessen those numbers.,0,C2,05/16/2023
"Chair, item D’s next meeting is June 20th so it's our standard third Tuesday, but July 26th is the next one so that's the last Wednesday in July. Then August 15th we're back on schedule to Tuesday.",0,C2,05/16/2023
I did have one more on the government matters. When you mentioned Wailuku didn't the new mayor of Maui make a statement about wanting to buy them and is there any progress that we're aware of the county acquisition of the major purveyor for Nā Wai ‘Ehā.,0,C2,05/16/2023
I can provide an update on that one. We did hear from the Department of Water Supply staff that Mayor Bissen is interested and that they are going through their due diligence on that acquisition. Having heard that we already proactively reached out to the Department of Water Supply and their new leadership to kind of walk through the Nā Wai ‘Ehā decision that the commission made and that the obligations that they would have to commit to if they were to take on that kuleana in lieu of Wailuku water company and then discuss some potential future opportunities.,0,C2,05/16/2023
"Request for Preliminary Approval of the Memorandum of Agreement between the State of Hawaiʻi, Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of State Parks and the Commission on Water Resource Management Regarding Installation and Maintenance of a Monitoring Well and Related Features at Hāpuna Beach State Recreation Area, South Kohala, Hawaiʻi Island",1,B2,09/19/2023
"PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Neal Fujii, Ryan Imata Staff stated that the Commission on Water Resource Management would delegate authority to the Deputy Director to enter into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the State of Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of State Parks (State Parks) to allow the installation of a monitoring well within the Hāpuna Beach Recreation Area.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"I just have a brief one. If you can just, because we have a large public audience, you want to just explain the value of this deep monitoring well?",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Absolutely. The Waimea Aquifer system, which if you refer to your Exhibit, let’s see...the map over here. Oh, it doesn’t have the map. Waimea, there’s a lot of high level up in the Waimea town area, but much of the hydrology is unknown in the basal area. And there also may be some very deep fresh water in the area. The purpose of this well is really to get a better idea of the geology, hydrogeology, also to see if there is any deep fresh water in the area. If it turns out not to have the deep fresh, they’ll adjust the specifications and the depth of the well and things of that nature. That’s really the, one of the aquifer systems that we don’t have too much data for, so this is going to help with the science and understanding what we know. It’s also in a good location because it’s a state park, those types of easements and issues.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"I just want to clarify, this is a CWRM initiative and that’s why CWRM is doing the Ka Paʻakai.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Yeah, Ka Paʻakai and consultation with Historic Preservation, all that’s going to occur kind of during the permitting process and Engineering division’s going to help us do that.",1,B2,09/19/2023
Is this the one time we’ll see this or will it come back to us?,1,B2,09/19/2023
"Yeah, the permitting itself will come back to the Commission. It’s going to be like any other well that like an outside party would. This time it’s going to be like Engineering division coming in for the permitting and not necessarily CWRM personnel. Does that make sense?",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Sorry Neil, I should clarify. Ryan Imata, Groundwater Branch. It’s actually going to be a ministerial permit, so we’re not going to bring it back before the Commission (inaudible). But we can certainly do some informational briefing once it’s drilled and once we’ve determined if we can find a deep confined lens or whether it’s going to be a drill as a conventional deep monitor well. Thanks, Neil.",1,B2,09/19/2023
Thanks for the clarification.,1,B2,09/19/2023
"Just curious, how big a shaft is that diameter? Do you know?",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Casing diameter? Are you talking about the casing diameter? I think the conventional deep monitor wells are about a 6-inch diameter well. We’re still discussing whether if we find the deep confined lens if we’re going to put two nested wells in one hole or possibly drill two holes. Because we’re so close to the coastline, into the basal lens it’s not that deep. What we could do is we could drill down into the basal lens, see where the basal lens is and see if there’s a deep confined. We could put one deep confined well in and then move over and drill another conventional well.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Thank you, I was just curious. That makes good sense.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Just for my own understanding, what differentiates a well permit being a ministerial versus what comes before the Commission?",1,B2,09/19/2023
That’s a good question.,1,B2,09/19/2023
"I don’t want to take up too much time on this. Back in 1997, the Commission adopted the Hawai‘i Well Construction Pump Installation Standards. That was to ensure that any well that’s drilled is in compliance with our standards and doesn’t need really sort of discretionary decision on part of the Commission. There are occasions, and I’ll list two of them, where we would bring a well to the, well three maybe. One of them is if there are serious disputes about it. And the other would be if they’re looking for a variance or any deviation from the well standards. And also just as a matter of course, when it’s in a designated water management area and we bring the water use permit to the Commission for approval, at the same time if there’s a pump installation permit, we bring that to the Commission just so that the approval process. We’re not approving a pump installation permit prior to someone getting a water use permit. So, those are three instances we would bring applications to the Commission. There’s also in certain cases, like with the Keauhou designation requiring some applications come to the Commission. We bring those, too. But over 95% of our well applications are approved ministerially, delegated to the Chair through the Hawai‘i Well Construction Standards.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Oh good. Thanks, Ryan. That’s all.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Maybe Ryan or Dean or Neal, I’m trying to distinguish Ka Pa‘akai. Is there ever a question as to the impact of an exploratory well on the nearshore waters, that we would require some kind of a monitoring requirement?",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Generally, monitor wells don’t have the kind of impacts that we would see via production wells. You’re not going to see any kind of depletion of freshwater coastal discharge or even impacts on other wells. We have to be very concerned though about puncturing into that deep confined and potentially causing short circuiting of the two aquifers, cross connection between the two aquifers. So, we’re very cognizant of that and want to make sure that the impacts are minimal.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"I think it is just really important that we clearly distinguish that because of community’s concerns. Anytime we talk about a well permit, what are impacts? I think it is important that there’s a distinction between well construction and an exploratory well permit.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"It’s not exploratory, it’s more (inaudible). CHAIR CHANG: Yeah, deep depth. Sorry, my mistake.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Sorry, I do have a comment then. In this case, we are talking about deep monitoring wells, but it sounds like it’s being used for exploratory purposes or understanding. But being cognizant that even though this might not have impacts, it might invite other types of...it’s going to drag up different kinds of questions and concerns and we should be prepared for that.",1,B2,09/19/2023
That’s a great point. And one of the things that Kaleo always advocated for was for us to have a better understanding of deep confined lens. Because I think there’s talk about drilling wells into that deep confined lens and Kaleo’s hesitation was always that we don’t have a good understanding of what’s happening with the deep confined lens. But we are focusing a lot of our efforts on trying to understand that deep confined lens so that questions can be answered and we can present the best information to you guys as decision makers.,1,B2,09/19/2023
"But I think as you’re doing your Ka Paʻakai, you need to be cognizant of clearly articulating the difference between potential impacts on this well and another type of well.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Chair Chang and Commissioners my name is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer for the record. While I appear in front of you for many clients, I'm giving this testimony as my own. There is nothing that I have seen in the staff submittal that indicated that there was an attempt to drill into and discover a deep confined freshwater aquifer with low salt water in the submittal. The first I heard of it was happening to listen to the oral presentation from staff right now. I'm going to urge you to defer action on this matter for a number of reasons. Mostly and this is I think starting to hint at from Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani, if on the State's dime you determine that there is deep confined groundwater in this part of Hawaii Island, you effectively have de-leveraged all the risks that private entities will face in trying to exploit that resource for commercial purposes. It is, even if not designed explicitly as an exploratory well, functioning to identify a new water source which, given my understanding of the history that you have done a similar well along Hinalani Street and it has continued to leak water and has not been successfully capped for many, many months now is a dangerous proposition. I'm happy to answer any questions and I'm sorry to take time away from the people who have waited hours and hours like I have to testify on the Maui matters, but this matter requires testimony and I urge you to defer action.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"I trust Likeke’s professional opinion and I will ask you, I will testify to ask please defer. This doesn't feel right in my naʻau and we're talking about our wai. We’ve been talking about wai all day when it comes to Maui, but this is Oʻahu and I've been at these meetings so many times and we're in a fight for our life and our future. I want to just say please defer so you can take a more careful look at what's happening here, thank you.",1,B2,09/19/2023
I would like to hear from our staff in response to what Jonathan said.,1,B2,09/19/2023
I’m going to do one question at a time.,1,B2,09/19/2023
Do you have any detail on the grouting protection should artesian conditions be encountered?,1,B2,09/19/2023
I’m going to have to defer to Ryan again as far as construction details and specifications.,1,B2,09/19/2023
"Yeah, thank you. The question is about grouting with respect to finding the deep confined. I think our intent is really to approach this with a lot of caution. Again, what we learned from the Kaloko deep monitoring well and quite frankly a lot of other wells in the area is Jonathan’s comment about potential short circuiting of the aquifer. We take that very seriously and we don’t want the intent of the well to cause any kind of adverse impacts. So, as I think as they are progressing with drilling, if they find a deep confined lens and as soon as they punch through, the intent would probably be and we have to consult with our consultants on this, but the intent would probably be to seal it up. And potentially just develop, you know one well or the other well, whether we do it as a nested design or we drill two wells. Again, the intent is not for us to in any way turn this into any kind of production well. Kaleo and our staff had long discussions about the utility of this well and the utility of understanding the deep confined lens because one thing about the Big Island and actually quite frankly many areas throughout the State is we don’t understand the geology of deep confined lenses. So, that’s the intent of this proposed well. I will note that the action that you are taking today, too, has really no bearing on the actual permit itself. This is just a memorandum of understanding between CWRM and State Parks because the well is being drilled on State Parks land. Thanks.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Larry, you had a question?",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Aloha, Rosa Pualeiʻia Monta, checking in from Kamuela, Hawaiʻi. I just wanted to, I didn't even know this was on the agenda today, but I just want to encourage you guys to defer also because this is another situation where we have a very resort dense area down on the coast and Hapuna has been without water for a long time. It's one of the few areas that our community is able to use and it's changed a lot in the years as far as the local demographic using it versus what it's used as now. I strongly encourage you to look more into this issue because if you all have ever been to Waimea, I want you to picture what you picture Waimea to be like because it's always been green and now it's brown and all of that water goes downhill. Gravity pulls it down to the coast. So, whether you're drilling down there or up here to feed down there, it still affects our aquifers and our water up here so please defer, mahalo.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Aloha mai Commissioners and e kala mai, I was here to testify on C-1 and just learning about this issue here. I’m calling in from Waimea. I just want to express my concern on multiple fronts. The Commission was briefed previously on the changes in the precipitation and the recharge rate for the Waimea Aquifer. I believe at this point we are beyond sustainable yield if we take into authorized planned use for Waimea. There was a proposition to combine two of the aquifers that never passed and as it stands with the data that we have and we heard that in earlier meetings by Dean, we're over 90 percent of sustainable yield and Waimea Aquifer should be designated. I'm extremely concerned with this idea that we're going to find deep water and somehow that that will change the present and current status. The work of the Commission should be directed towards addressing the issues that we have now with the data that is available and particularly with the lack of understanding of these deep- water wells as Jonathan has stated. We wouldn't want it not to be correctly done and potentially lose precious fresh water or get mixing with salt water. I would recommend the Commission also defer and I will state that you know this is another instance where if we had Deputy Manuel here, we could ask a lot more pertinent questions and I think the community might have a little more trust on this particular issue. Mahalo for your time and look forward to testifying on C-1.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Aloha, my name is Tara Rojas. I just wanted to say as well just sitting there you know I didn't realize what this issue was, but I just wanted just to bring this to attention that it says right here, Item B-1, the summary of request that the Commission on Water Resource Management Commission to delegate authority to the deputy director to enter into a MOA with the State of Hawaiʻi Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of State Parks to allow the installation of a monitoring well within the Hāpuna Beach Recreation. Then I just you know put it up really quick and I was looking at this and it says right there, the time of performance. Just to keep in mind that this kind of decisions, like where did it come up from? It seems that not a lot of people are aware until we were here and we hear about it and these are the type of things that continue to keep happening. The MOA says, shall be executed as of the date of Commission approval for this submittal. If this is going to be approved really quickly you know so we can continue on with the testimony for Lahaina, Maui, that is to be of concern. It said it would remain in effect for 10 years after which it is renewable at the option of all parties. Then there's other information about that, but just to keep that in mind. Then lastly says right here, consistency with the Hawaiʻi Water Plan, the proposed MOA will assist the Commission in accomplishing goals identified in the Water Resource Protection Plan. It says the goal of this WRPP 2019 update refers to the goal of constructing new deep monitoring wells in critical aquifers to gather and utilize data to identify impacts from pumpage, climate, and land-use changes, fresh water sustainable yields, and monitor recharge trends. Then the purpose of it is again to test the Waimea Aquifer System by collecting data but the thing is this type of thing I think we should all look at. What is this Water Resource Protection Plan and it's under Task 1.8.1 of the 2019 update of that WRPP. I guess we should be aware of what this is and to know that how this process is that this type of thing can pop up. It seems like a nonchalant, okay we'll just approve these things, but if somebody came up and spoke who knows about it and says uh-uh. Even sitting there was just like something in the naʻau that this is the type of things that we need to know what's happening because it's going to keep coming up. Things are going to keep getting passed and so we have to just continually be aware. Mahalo.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Aloha mai kākou, for the record my name is Kāpua Sproat and I am also testifying today in my personal capacity. I, like many others in this room and outside, I actually came to testify on C-1 and I will do so later, but I wanted to share my significant concern. Looking at the submittal as it's been presented, the MOA defers the Ka Paʻakai analysis until later on. I'm just wondering, my question for you Chair because I know you're very committed to Ka Paʻakai analysis, you understand that this operationalizes the Water Commission's kuleana under Article 12 Section 7, so it's really important to do. To me, if the MOA is going to be entered into and then the Ka Paʻakai analysis is going to be done at a later date, it puts the cart before the horse because shouldn’t the Ka Paʻakai analysis be done first to examine precisely the issues that Jonathan and other folks and Dr. Beamer and other folks are raising so that this Commission can make an informed decision about whether or not it's sufficiently protecting traditional and customary rights and resources under Article 12 Section 7? My additional concern is that if it's being delegated then what opportunity will the community have to participate in the process? Because in my experience it's often, and I'm grateful that the Commission is taking on the kuleana to do the Ka Paʻakai analysis. I will say that without Deputy Director Manuel, I have significant concerns about the staff's ability to be able to facilitate this kind of work in communication and in partnership with the community. There’s two points. One, this puts a cart before the horse but two, especially if the Commission is going to move forward with this without the assistance and guidance and knowledge and integrity of Deputy Director Manuel, I have concerns about what additional protections or opportunity there’ll be for the community to analyze the Ka Paʻakai analysis or provide input to ensure that it's adequate. I would also strongly recommend deferring action not just because I would like to testify on C-1, but also because I have significant concerns and I know Neil and Ryan and everyone else want to make sure that this is pono and do the right thing.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"I think with this conversation that we’ve been having, how would you better understand the aquifer without doing monitoring wells? Having heard today’s testimony before the Commission, earlier you described what kind of permits come before the Commission and what kind of permits are handled ministerially. Wouldn’t this show that the permit should now be handled through a Commission review? And we can move forward with executing supremely because it has nothing to do with the permit. You will then work on the permit. It puts things in the proper perspective where the Ka Pa‘akai analysis would be done at the time of the permit presentation and it shouldn’t take any longer for either one, right? Other than getting on our calendar. Does that sound reasonable hearing the public’s testimony today?",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Maybe I’ll speak up as the Chair of the department. Clearly all of you have raised some very legitimate questions about whether it’s ministerial or whether it should be a Commission action. I think that’s a very legitimate question. We’ve had some internal discussions about that. I appreciate, Kāpua, the question about Ka Pa‘akai and even Jonathan’s question about what does this mean. Perhaps, Dean, we should consider deferring this matter to really address some of the larger policy questions that have been raised here. I think that seems to be appropriate.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"I would also advise deferment. We understand so little about how our aquifers are connected that if we, through punching these holes create a connection, we not might not be able to stop it. And again, if Deputy Director Manuel was here, I trust his input greatly and I would maybe feel more confident that we had the data. We have a lot of ways to understand what is under the ground now. I would like to have more detail about whether we're doing seismic testing. We can use minor charges to get information about what is under the ground we are on to make sure that we are not potentially connecting things that haven't been connected before. Thank you.",1,B2,09/19/2023
"Can I add a couple specific things maybe for the staff to consider the concerns that were raised and should be addressed in the next submittal? And include the Ka Pa‘akai analysis on the front end. At least to address the concerns (inaudible). To the extent that these can really be considered and really justified. We value the O‘ahu deep monitoring wells for helping us understand our aquifer. We do need them in other places, but the geology is different on different islands. How are we addressing, thinking about this proactively and very consciously, given the drama around the other wells that sort of preceded my time. But like let’s take that in, address it in the front, and then make the next necessary steps. And why it’s needed for Waimea, just as Dr. Beamer had mentioned. To really justify it so it’s on record. I’d appreciate that.",1,B2,09/19/2023

"PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Dr. Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Branch Staff presented a general summary of conditions in the Waikoloa Surface Water Hydrologic Unit on Hawaiʻi Island.",0,C2,03/19/2024
"Is Hawaiʻi DWS online? I was curious about that, there must be reasons when and why they rely on those wells and better understanding. I’m curious about how they manage their system and balance all the sources. Two, with the alternative source just on the other side, if you look on the leeward side there’s that use, but that area also feeds Waipiʻo, right? My recollection is that the Hāmākua Ditch dewatered Hiʻilawe and so the implications of thinking about when we move an alternative, already creating potential other issues on the other side.",0,C2,03/19/2024
"I go into this in the IFSAR (Instream Flow Standard Assessment Report), but I didn’t want to go into too much detail in this presentation. The Commission is currently monitoring both ditch systems for the Department of Agriculture. We have a good working relationship with people on the ground. We’re not talking about dewatering an entire stream as an alternative, we’re talking about when needed, divert some of the water from the Upper Hāmākua Ditch into this reservoir. The Upper Hāmākua Ditch has the available capacity, it’s already diverting water. Department of Agriculture utilizes only about 1 MGD of what’s diverted, it just gets moved through the system. I know from experience on the ground and previous DLNR Water Commission reports about the Lower Hāmākua Ditch that there is substantially more water diverted than is utilized on a daily basis. That is simply because there’s leakage loss, there’s a lot of homesteads that are maybe taking water from the ditch that nobody knew about. If you saw how much water was delivered to the Paʻauilo Reservoir at the end of the Lower Hāmākua Ditch, you’d be astounded at how much water was diverted out of Waipiʻo Stream. The issue isn’t with the Upper Hāmākua Ditch, it’s with the Lower Hāmākua Ditch and addressing how that gets operated in terms of ensuring a continuous flow past each of the intakes, would go a longer way towards ensuring instream values in Waipiʻo Valley and Wailoa Stream are being met. I just think of the water, Waipiʻo has a lot of water. Taking a small amount as a backup as an alternative for drinking water supply is kind of an easy ask versus the millions and millions of gallons taken by the Lower Hāmākua Ditch that gets lost in the system.",0,C2,03/19/2024
"Thanks for explaining that. Then the wells, do you know more?",0,C2,03/19/2024
In terms of the groundwater geology?,0,C2,03/19/2024
Those sporadic periods at when Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply utilized those ground water sources do you do any more about why and when?,0,C2,03/19/2024
"I don’t know, they don’t necessarily line up to low flow conditions per se, but I’m not sure why exactly they operate them at those short intervals or just to keep them operational.",0,C2,03/19/2024
"It’s related to those groundwater wells. If you do the 1.4 MGD into the streams, do you have any idea about how much more they’ll have to pump that groundwater and what it would cost them? Also, whether they’ve raised that issue at all?",0,C2,03/19/2024
"If they had 150 million gallons of storage, I don’t think they’ll have to operate them at any more so than they currently have. I don’t know where the breakeven point is in terms of surface water storage and existing water demands or future water demands because they have not updated their water use and development plan since I think 2003. There is a big difference between 115 million gallons of storage and 165 million gallons of storage, but their current system demand is 1.8 million gallons per day. It’s either somewhere around 100 days of storage or 80 days of storage, that’s for just utilizing surface water and assuming no additional surface water. Again, the ability to capture runoff events from Kohākōhau and from Waikoloa to even when there’s three days of high flow events, they can fill up a reservoir pretty quickly. They have.",0,C2,03/19/2024
"So, they’ve never really raised any issue about extra cost for them for using more groundwater?",0,C2,03/19/2024
The Waikoloa wind farm that was tied to the pumpage of certain groundwater wells for the county has not been fully utilized so they have been sued in terms of the violation of that power purchase agreement with the operator of the wind farm. I don’t know if it would cost them more or if they would be able to utilize existing electricity that they are already needing to pay for. Obviously pumping wells costs more money than letting the surface water flow into their system.,0,C2,03/19/2024
What would it cost to rehabilitate that 50-million-gallon reservoir?,0,C2,03/19/2024
"It kind of depends on Dam Safety’s questions. There was some thought that they could just re-line it, but then I think they needed a new engineering study to look at the subsurface around the reservoir to make sure it’s stable.",0,C2,03/19/2024

"But that’s part and parcel of all of this, putting everything in context would be helpful.",0,C2,03/19/2024
"If you look at the numbers, the most recent demands are somewhere around 1.4 MGD and then I’ve estimated the impact assuming a demand of 1.8 MGD. I’m already providing some buffer in terms of extreme demand from that system. I also know that there’s additional developments possibly in the works, but whether they have allocations from the system, that doesn’t come across our desk. We just look at their water audits.",0,C2,03/19/2024
"It’s difficult to judge, put it in context. PUBLIC TESTIMONY",0,C2,03/19/2024

"Did you get the notice of when the public meeting is going to be? Thursday, April 18th, 5:30 to 7, Waimea Community Center. Ayron, have you received any comments from Hawaii Department of Water at this point?",0,C2,03/19/2024
"No, and we sent the draft Instream Flow Standard Assessment Report to both Department of Planning at the County of Hawaii and the Department of Water Supply and I’ve been in email communication with Department of Planning, but DWS has not been responsive. We do have a meeting scheduled for next week or the following week with them so I’m sure this will get brought up.",0,C2,03/19/2024

"So, it's not based on traditional and customary?",1,B1,07/23/2024
Then why is it in the submittal? It says that they have traditional and customary rights on the basis of the Commission in its past decision - said all of the Nā Wai ʻEhā area was traditional and that any Native Hawaiian qualifies which is a deviation from what the current law is. If you guys don't know?,1,B1,07/23/2024
"I did not prepare this submittal, I apologize.",1,B1,07/23/2024
They're not claiming traditional and customary rights.,1,B1,07/23/2024
Why did you guys state that then? What was the purpose of saying they had traditional and customary rights?,1,B1,07/23/2024
"No, they did not have traditional and customary rights. They claimed appurtenant rights, but those rights were extinguished.",1,B1,07/23/2024
"That's another issue. I understand, well anyway, I saw in here somewhere that they were recognized on the basis that one of them was a Hawaiian and that the entire Nā Wai ʻEhā area was traditional and customary practices. My objection is that if that's the basis for giving this permit, I can't support that because what it's saying is that the entire Nā Wai ʻEhā area is traditional and customary practice, regardless of whether I had ever been there prior to 1892 -meaning my ancestors. As long as I'm native Hawaiian, I have traditional and customary rights. That is totally wrong. The other issue is that on the appurtenant rights, I continue to say that you can no longer extinguish it from 1978 and certainly from 1987. The Commission's decision back then says and I will quote, “The Commission has the duty to adhere to Reppun - the Reppun case - until the decision has been reversed or overruled by the court of last resort or altered by legislative enactment.” When I as the hearings officer dealt with this issue, I focused on the “or legislative enactment.” What the Commission did was simply eliminated from the decision, all of my discussion on legislative enactment and said that, oh we have to adhere to Reppun, otherwise we could be in trouble later on. I went into detail in my proposed Decision and Order on that in that the Reppun decision dealt with circumstances from ‘75 to ‘76 even though the decision was issued in 1980. The court has been clear that when they deal with this, they only deal with the issues at hand and they're not going to speculate about future issues. Regardless of that, in the first Waiāhole case in 2000, a couple of parties that objected that the ‘78 Constitutional amendments were not in effect until legislation was passed and the court said, nope. Once it was ratified, it's self-executing, so ‘78 where it preserved the appurtenant rights was established in 1978. Whether you agreed with that or not, in 1987 the Water Code was passed, reflecting their preservation of appurtenant rights. At least from 1987 on, you can't extinguish appurtenant rights and this reservation was made in 1990. My contention is appurtenant rights no longer can be extinguished because it has a statutory basis just as riparian rights can be extinguished because they have a statutory basis. Now, what to me is really strange is that the Commission’s decision said, oh we cannot until the Supreme Court tells us, we have to stick to Reppun, we have to adhere to case law. And yet, they turn around on the traditional and customary rights, they first say it was my recommendation as the hearings officer that a person had to personally trace their traditional and customary practice back before November 25, 1892 in a particular area. That wasn't my recommendation, that's the law. I was citing a case. What the Commission now says is that we deem all of Nā Wai ʻEhā as an area of traditional and customary practice and that any Hawaiian, whether or not they had ever resided in or their ancestors resided there, anybody. Urban Hawaiian living in Honolulu moves to Maui, they will have traditional and customary rights anywhere in Nā Wai ʻEhā. I can’t agree with that. I can approve this permit if it’s based on and with the priority of appurtenant rights, but not on traditional and customary rights. If the approval is based on neither of those and just because it's whatever the domestic use is, I'm fine with that, but I cannot go along with those two things.",1,B1,07/23/2024

But, I'm just warning you that these cases come up and I know there are others coming up that claims, number one - appurtenant rights are extinguished, but more importantly changes radically the definition of traditional and customary rights.

"I don’t hear Mark jumping in. This is Sean O’Keefe, director of Environmental Affairs for Alexander and Baldwin. I just wanted to highlight that the approvals that were previously obtained for the work on the category one diversions were for the O & M (operation and maintenance) work that has already been completed. By approvals I mean approvals by agencies other than this Commission and so we just wanted to again highlight the fact that if the additional work is approved by the Commission, then we’re going to have to go back to these other various agencies OCCL (Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands), the Clean Water Branch, Corps of Engineers. For a couple of diversions, the county with regard to SMA (Special Management Area) permitting and get separate approvals for the additional work. I don’t expect that to be especially complicated especially since they’ve got some familiarity with this project already, but it’s definitely boxes we need to tick before we can go out in the field and do the actual work. I don’t know if Mark, I stepped on your toes at all in jumping in but that is one point we wanted to make.",1,B6,01/30/2024
"Aloha, sorry about that. I had to get some help, I’m not that smart when it comes to the computer. I heard Sean’s testimony and we’re prepared to work with the submittal to move forward with this, get this put behind us. I know this has taken forever and I’d just like to get this put behind us. We’re willing to do whatever we need to do to make sure this is taken care of.",1,B6,01/30/2024
"I have a quick one because I wasn’t around in the earlier 2020 discussion. For those Commissioners who were and staff, those reasons for the reservations, have they all been addressed with this submittal? I see various comments for each of those diversions and so are those? It’s interesting that there’s no testimony so I’m kind of curious how those have been addressed and what’s changed?",1,B6,01/30/2024
Reservations meaning the Sierra Club’s comments and DOFAW?,1,B6,01/30/2024
"What I meant is the reason that the Commission deferred action on the stream diversion permit application, have those all been addressed? This was a very site-specific submittal.",1,B6,01/30/2024
"I believe so, we were just in the field actually yesterday with Sierra Club members in a related action. They mentioned to us that they’ll just be monitoring but I think we’ve addressed all of their concerns while still maintaining the viability of the system. For example, there are portions where the tunnel runs underneath the stream channel with the diversion just adjacent to it or above it. Working with EMI and Sean with Alexander and Baldwin, they’re willing to make those modifications without impact to the remaining system.",1,B6,01/30/2024
So those quarterly meetings are working?,1,B6,01/30/2024
"This was a little outside of that meeting specifically. We had met specifically with DOFAW, DAR, and Sierra Club over the years.",1,B6,01/30/2024
Just out of curiosity I think early on there was some concern that if the flows in the ditch got too low it would affect the ditch walls and things like that. That hasn’t happened? I don’t know how much the flows have decreased.,1,B6,01/30/2024
"We’ve decreased the flows significantly just to meet the irrigation demand on the farm and the Upcountry, particularly in the Wailoa Ditch and thus far we haven’t found any issue with that. Thank you for asking.",1,B6,01/30/2024
MOTION: (HANNAHS / MIIKE) To approve staff recommendation as submitted.,1,B6,01/30/2024
"Ready? Good morning, Chair and Commissioners. Ryan Imata. I am the program manager for thGroundwater Regulation Branch. Today I'm going to be presenting to you a briefing on Item C-1. This will be a briefing on the commission's data on wells related to the Red Hill fuel tank crisis. So let me share my screen first. I think you can all see that now, so I'm going to give you a little bit of an overview of my presentation today. It should take about maybe 10 minutes or so. And this is kind of a little bit of a spoiler for you.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"So the items I'm gonna go over, first of all, are 1. What are the commission's deep monitor well data, and what does that tell us about the aquifers in question? Well, the punch line is the aquifers are robust, and they're relatively healthy right now. 2. The second item I'm gonna go over is the well pumpage for the three wells on the Navy system, and the good news about that is the Navy wells are being pumped within the allocated amounts that the commission has allocated to them, and chlorides are stable. 3. The final point I'm going to discuss is the Navy monitor wells that have been both drilled so far and what is being proposed.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"So my next slide is showing you the aquifer system areas on Oahu, and that our primary — can you see my cursor? Our primary area of concern is generally Waipahu-Waiwa because this is the extent of the Navy's water system and  their source  the Waiawa Shaft is up here  and primarily Waimalu and Moanalua where the Red Hill Tank Farm is located. So, first of all, let's talk about our deep monitor well data. I'm going to show you the areas that  the three deep monitor wells that I'm gonna sort of talk to you about with respect to what we're seeing in the aquifer. First of all, there's the Waipio Mauka well. This is  if you know the area, this is located on the road headed up to the Mililani Mortuary. This is located within the Waipahu-Waiawa Aquifer system area. We have a Waimalu deep monitor well that's located within the Waimalu Aquifer system area, and we also have our Halawa deep monitor well, which is also actually located within Waimalu, and then this  this boundary right here is the Moanalua Aquifer system. So I want to show you  this is a little bit of a blowup. So these are the Halawa and the Waimalu deep monitor well locations relative to some critical shafts. Right? So this is Halawa Shaft that the board operates, and this is  this, as you know, has been shut down for quite a while. This is the Red Hill Shaft that the Navy operates. And so I just wanted to give you some  some reference for the location of the Halawa deep monitor well and the Waimalu deep monitor well, and what this is  what the data is telling us about the aquifer relative to the shafts. free to stop me if you have questions on specific slides or anything that I'm saying. That might be easier than  than going  going back at the end, but it's certainly up to  up to you guys. So let's talk about the aquifer health and those deep monitor wells. The commission looks to aquifer health by assessing data which we plot showing historic elevations of a couple of things The water level that we initially encounter when we drop our equipment down the well, the top at midpoint of the transition zones from fresh to saltwater. In the following slides, you're going to see data compiled from field investigations that our survey branch has done near our Red Hill facility, and these data are presented as a time series. So, first of all, if you can remember Halawa deep monitor well, Halawa deep monitor well is located on the Halawa Prison site. And this is something that we're not quite sure about, but the thickness of the freshwater lens  and I'll show you the profile in the next slide. The thickness of the freshwater lens located near Halawa deep monitor well is obscured by an up flow of brackish water in the well. And so I'll explain that a little bit more in the next slide. However, the elevations of the top of the transition zone, midpoint of the transition zone, and the location of seawater indicate that the conditions are relatively stable in this region of the aquifer to the next slide, you'll see that there  there were some  I think a little bit of decline prior to 2010. We're trying  still trying to figure out what that's attributed to, but as you can see, since  since around 2010-2011, this is the water table. This is the top of the transition zone, this is the midpoint of the transition zone, and this is seawater. And I will note that, again, the  the brackish up-flow has kind of made us question the thickness of the  of the brackish lens, but I will also note that  this gets a little bit technical, but we have a way of estimating the midpoint of the transition zone through the  through the Ghyben-Herzberg equation. The Ghyben-Herzberg equation takes into account the water table above mean sea level and calculates the midpoint of the transition zone is about 40  40 times initial head. So if it's one foot, it's 40 feet. If it's two feet, it's 80 feet, and so on. So this line here represents what we would calculate from Ghyben-Herzberg as the midpoint of the transition zone. Fortunately, it appears that the midpoint of the transition zone is still far below the Ghyben-Herzberg calculated midpoint of the transition zone So what is this telling us? It's telling us that based on what we know, despite the up-flow or (inaudible) flow of the  of the brackish water, we think that it's both relatively stable and relatively healthy because this midpoint is far below what we would calculate as the midpoint of the transition zone. So that's data on our Halawa deep monitoring well. Next, let's go to Waimalu. So Waimalu is located, I suppose, northwest of the Red Hill fuel tank storage facility. It does appear that the freshwater lens in Waimalu continues to thicken, indicating that it's probable that there's a long-term influx of fresh water from the Ko'olaus And the second point is just  it's something that we're kind of speculating, so it's by no means definitive, but the presence of this increasing thickness of fresh water makes us theorize that there may be a hydraulic buffer for the Halawa Shaft that the deflects releases migrating northwest across Halawa Valley from the storage facility. Again, that's a theory, so we can't define that yet, but as you'll see at the end of my presentation, data is being collected to understand what's happening with respect to the plume and  and so you'll see that at the end. Okay? So that's Waimalu.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"So the theory, that theory, how would that affect contaminants that would come out of the Red Hill facility?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah. Thank you, Commissioner Buck. So I guess our theory is that if there is a high flux of watecoming from the Ko‘olaus, there could  there could potentially be a hydraulic buffer between Halawa  between the bulk storage facility and Halawa Shaft, but that sort of remains to be seen with the data that we are collecting from  or not that we're collecting, but the Navy is, and their consultants are collecting from the deep water  from the monitor wells. Does that answer your question?",0,C1,06/20/2023
So the volume of the water would deflect any contaminants and stop its westward movement? Is that  is that what I'm hearing?,0,C1,06/20/2023
"I mean, you're  in theory, I don't know if  that it would deflect it, but it would suggest that there's a large quantity of water coming down from the Ko‘olaus  and again, you know, the location of",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Let me back up a couple of slides. So the location of  the location of Waimalu deep monitor well, it's  you know, it's all the way over here. The facility is actually around here. Right? So",0,C1,06/20/2023
"So, you know, there's this  you know, one of the  one of the thoughts that our geologists had was that because so much water is coming down and we see a thickening of the lens here, that it  could that suggestre's  rather than having lateral flow this way, 'cause it's helped to deflect the flow away from Halawa Shaft if there's contaminants coming from the fuel storage tank facility. That's just  again, it's just a theory, so I don't want to really put too much weight into that right now until data is collected from  from the monitor wells.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Ryan, if the theory is important, what's the process for either proving it or negating it?",0,C1,06/20/2023
So I know that as part of the  and perhaps Commissioner Seto can  can address this. I know that there were portions of the administrative order on consent that required determination of groundwater flow patterns and  and groundwater modeling. So I don't know that our theory would necessarily be  how do I say this? I think that we would  we would understand better if the  the thickening of the lens in the context of what the models are estimating. Does that make sense?,0,C1,06/20/2023
Not  not to me.(Laughter.),0,C1,06/20/2023
Go ahead and finish this.,0,C1,06/20/2023
"Oh, no. I was just gonna say that   don't think that that  I mean, it could be  the data that we're collecting from this deep monitor well could certainly be used by whoever is preparing the model in estimating groundwater flow, but in and of itself, I don't know that  that we  that that provides us enough data to really make a defining statement on groundwater flow patterns. Because, again, you'll see the proximity of this well to the fuels tank facility, and you see the location of Halawa Shaft, it's far enough away that it  it really is just a theory right now that would be validated once the model gets created and  and if it's  if our data can be used as an input parameter to the model, that's a good thing. Right? But I  I'm not a modeler, I don't understand that component of it, so, again, I  I think that perhaps our theory may be validated by whatever the model tells us, but I'm not sure that we can really make any definitive statement about it. I hope that made sense.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, quick question. Oh, I'm sorry.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Question, Ryan. So we  you're groundwater, and you focus on",0,C1,06/20/2023
"sort of what you can measure from a borehole, and that's just  but that's just like one",0,C1,06/20/2023
"seepage runs done in this area? Can we consider health  you know, if  if we have gaining streams in this area, and I don't know if there are, can we get a sense of the health? Has  has staff kind of considered sort of multiple streams of data together? Because we might just be looking at, like, the pulse and blood pressure when we need to be looking at, I don't know, lung capacity, you know, like other  multiple metrics of  of aquifer health.",0,C1,06/20/2023
Have we kind of fully squeezed the CWRM USGS data?,0,C1,06/20/2023
"Thank you. That's a  that is a great question. Right now, you know, we're sort of tasked  we are a very small branch within CWRM and really focusing a lot of our efforts on statewide monitoring, especially as emerging issues come out in Kona  that's not emerging, it's been  it's been emerged for quite a while now  and Lahaina. And so we  we have a staff of basically two guys that are going out to  to evaluate (inaudible). We are, incidentally  and thank you to Deputy Manuel. We are expanding our monitor well program to expand out, but, you know, regarding seepage runs and stream data, you know, I'll let maybe Dr. Strauch and he branch lead, Dean, maybe comment on that to really assess aquifer health as a  in a more holistic manner.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"I'll  I'll jump in real quick, and then if Ayron comes back, he can jump in. So I think you hit it on the head. Our groundwater guys are good at what they do, right, evaluating water levels, chlorides, the  the profile, right, of our aquifer, and oftentimes the changes in  in groundwater take years, if not decades to see, right, over time. So it's kind of just monitoring that. It's not a  you know, a rain event that all of a sudden our aquifer increases exponentially. But with that said, we do know there's interaction, and there's additional data sets and data gaps that we potentially need to fill. Kind of we're  you know (inaudible) of what Chair Chang had mentioned, we  the more data we have, the better and more informed decisions we can make holistically as it relates to aquifer health. So there  there are studies here. These are some gaining streams, so there is a groundwater-surface water connection per my initial conversations with Dr. Strauch. And if that's him, he can also add in.(Laughter.)",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Perfect timing. But there are spring sources, as we're aware of, along the coast which also indicate kind of this interaction or something  geology, right, creating that space for ground and surface waterinteraction. So we do look at it holistically. A lot of it's just taking the components of groundwater's research, the components of surface water's research, data from Department of Health and UH, and kind of putting that together and then looking at, okay, well, what is the management recommendations that we want to propose? Our primary tool in this region is water use permits, right, and the conditions of how  you know, the withdrawal of water and the impact that it has on both ground and surface water resources as well as public trust uses. So it's all connected. I just want to  I think we can add more to this. This is just one component, and we wanted to respond to the question from  I think (inaudible) question about, Can we  Can we have a conversation about the data that we're collecting? We hear a lot of DOH data, we hear a lot about Navy data, but what is the data that we're collecting? That's the purpose of today's presentation, to share that with you, get feedback on if you want us to focus or if there's things that you're seeing are missing, let us know, and we can look at what resources we have to try to fill those gaps.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Okay. So the  so the short answer is data streams, we don't have  we haven't put together the multiple streams of data, but according to deep monitor wells, it looks pretty good.",0,C1,06/20/2023
The groundwater aquifer health -,0,C1,06/20/2023
at this point. And he'll keep going through the rest of the system.,0,C1,06/20/2023
Yeah. I don't want to hold that up.,0,C1,06/20/2023
"No, no, no. That's  yeah, that's the general summary. I think you'll be hearing that as well.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Okay. So I  I believe this is where I left off, I think. We were looking at particularly Waimalu deep monitor well and how thick  lens thickening is  is maybe suggesting a hydraulic buffer. So as you can see as a time series, we have  the water table actually rose. It rose about maybe 18 and a half feet from May to April, May  from 2005 till 2023. We do see again a thickening of the transition zone here. And this is, again, Ghyben-Herzberg. So this is telling us that where it should be, and maybe it's  maybe it's arriving at a steady state condition, I don't know, but that this is  this is the data that we're collecting from the Waimalu deep monitoring well. So the last well that we're going to look at is the Waipio mauka deep monitor well. And again  shucks, you know what? We'll  I'll give you a little bit better information on this as we go through the Navy system wells. But again, this is the Waipio mauka deep monitor well that's located. right off of the road going up towards that Mililani Cemetery. So we see in this well the freshwater lens continues to slowly thin about may  well, about 100 feet. I don't know if you can say that's slow, but  but it's been 37 years since we've seen that. The elevation of the midpoint of the transition zone shows a gentle rise, but again, the current elevation is still below the calculated Ghyben-Herzberg elevation, which indicates to us that the current thickness is greater than expected. So going to the next slide, you can see again, this is  this is Ghyben-Herzberg, that's the midpoint of  this is the midpoint of the transition zone. So this is the top of the transition zone. So we are quite significantly below the calculated Ghyben-Herzberg midpoint of the transition zone. And again, this well is located kind of close to the Navy's Waiawa Shaft, which they are  they've placed a hundred percent reliance on to supply water for existing. So that's a good segue into the next portion of my presentation, which is talking about Navy system pumping centers. So",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Ryan, Ryan, excuse me. Before you go on to the next subject.",0,C1,06/20/2023
I'm curious. The thickening has occurred since 2005. Could  might the Waiāhole water decision and/or the diminished use of water for sugar have contributed to less withdrawal and more retainment?,0,C1,06/20/2023
"So  so it appears that Waipio mauka has actually  the water level is rising, but we're also seeing a rise of the midpoint  at the top of the transition zone and the midpoint of the transition zone, so, you know, that would suggest some  some kind of  I don't know. I mean, at this point, could that suggest some kind of depletion? I'm not really sure. Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, we  with respect to Waiāhole, we see development tunnels are quite  still actively in use, and I believe that though the development tunnels are on the windward side, they do extend  it appears that they may extend hydrologically possibly into the Waipahu-Waiawa Aquifer system. So whether the development tunnels are depleting recharge of Waipahu-Waiawa, that's a  that's a great question. Although, you know, I think that  you know, I'm trying to think of the timeline now. I'm trying to think of Waiāhole Ditch with respect to, you know, the pineapple fields on the Kunia side, and when things started actually transitioning over from  the transition from sugar to pineapple and then pineapple to what's being seen in Kunia is  you know, what we're seeing is diversified crops and some seed corn. I think seed corn is kind of diminishing.- I've really gotta take  take a look at the data for what's  you know, for the Waiāhole withdrawals. Waiāhole is interesting, right, because they  what they do is there's a valve at the  at the north portal that  I think it's the north portal that they turn on and off depending on how much rainfall they get on the leeward side. There's also a development tunnel, Waiwa development tunnel, that actually develops water on the leeward side that  that's never really sort of shut off. Right? So I  it's hard for me to  all that to say that I think it's hard for me to attribute any kind of changes in the aquifer, you know, mauka or even within Waipo mauka as being attributed to sugar  the reduction of sugar production or the change in agricultural use. So the  I guess the short answer is I don't know.(Laughter.)",0,C1,06/20/2023
"I know I can be wordy, but it takes up  sometimes I'm processing my thoughts as I'm speaking.(Laughter.)",0,C1,06/20/2023
"If I can interject, Chair, I wanted to suggest  Scott Izuka from USGS, they released a really interesting groundwater availability scenarios report in April, and so maybe that can be",0,C1,06/20/2023
They're coming next month.(Laughter.),0,C1,06/20/2023
"Okay. They're already on it, yeah.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Sorry, we try to get you the cutting-edge data.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah. Well, WRRC hosted him, so the  the recording might  there might be a previous recording online, and then we'll hear next month. So I think that'll help us because it was really helpful to see his maps and  and have that dialogue, so  okay.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Okay, okay. So again, talking about  now we're segueing into the Navy pumping centers. So I'm gonna show you on the next map the three shaft sources that the Navy has for the system. Aiea Halawa Shaft is the smallest source. This has an allocation of 0.697 mgd. Red Hill Shaft is sort of a  I want to say a medium-sized source. It's definitely a lot smaller than the Board of Water Supply's Halawa Shaft, but it does have an allocation of 4.659 million gallons per day. Waiawa Shaft is the most productive shaft in the Waipahu-Waiwa Aquifer system, and it has an allocation of 14.977 mgd. And I will note that these are  all are under a public water system. So here's a map that shows you basically the extent of the Navy system. You can see how far  I mean, it extends all the way out into Ford Island, and then obviously out into the West Loch portion, airport point. Again, the Waiawa Shaft is the farthest sort of  it's not  farthest north, I guess, on the system, and I was mentioning that the  our Waipio mauka monitor well is like around here somewhere. This is  this is the Navy's Aiea-Halawa Shaft, which is a small allocation, like 0.497, and this is Red Hill Shaft, which is located right next to the field tank farm, so  and this one has the allocation of about 4 point  I don't know, under 5 mgd. So again, here's  here's a better map showing the location of the shafts. Here is  here's Waiawa Shaft, here's Aiea-Halawa, here's Red Hill Shaft. So let's look at the pumpage prior to the fuel release and the resulting change in pumpage as a response. So in November of 2021  oh, this doesn't look good. Right? Like in  they were pumping 0.272; they were within their allocation for Aiea-Halawa Shaft. Again, that's a small source. Waiawa Shaft, they were over-pumping at a very  very small on a 12-month moving average, but they were over-pumping it. And Red Hill Shaft was over-pumping by about a half a million gallons per day. So this doesn't look good. Combined 12-month moving average monthly pumpage of 20.363mgd. So the following three slides are just an indication  and this is kind of  it's a little bit  I don't want to be misleading about it because it's hard to tell by the scale. Right? If we're looking at the scale of this, this is really just 0.8 million gallons per day. So we're seeing  we saw a decrease in  in time series of the 12-month moving average from about  so we  so the graphs I'm providing you are from 2020 to the present, and you see a reduction of Aiea  they basically took Aiea-Halawa Shaft offline. I think they were pumping it for some testing purposes or whatever. Red Hill Shaft  let's see. So I think since  I can't remember the date, but they started pumping Red Hill Shaft in order to induce like a plume  plume containment situation. Is that right, Commissioner Seto? And  so they exceeded their allocation. Of course, you know, the allocation that the commission issued was  was for consumptive purposes, but they converted Red Hill Shaft over to pumping it for plume containment. So you'll  again, I don't want  I don't want this to be sort of  well, you can see. I mean, it's a  it was about  above their allocation. Maybe they  they peaked by about 0.2 mgd at one point and then started stepping down their pumpage of Red Hill Shaft. the last graph, again, I think this is  this one's a little bit confusing because you'll see my time series goes from 12.5 to 17. So if I had  if it went all the way down to zero, I think you'd have a better idea of how much they were over-pumping Waiawa Shaft. And I'm not making excuses for the Navy, by any means, but Waiawa Shaft was  is the only source that's online to supply their entire water system. So you can see how much in excess they did pump. We did  we are keeping tabs on their  both their pumpage and the chlorides of Waiawa Shaft on a more  a finer scale So let's talk about the change in pumpage as  in response to the release. Red Hill Shaft stopped in December 2021 and resumed on January 29, 2022, for plume containment, and they've been pumping an average of about 4.2 mgd Pumpage ceased at Aiea-Halawa Shaft at the same time. Pump started up again in September of 2022, and I think they just run the pumps periodically just for a couple of days a month, and they only pump about a hundred thousand gallons a month And then  oh, I'm sorry. And then Waiawa Shaft has always  again, that's the one that they exceeded their allocation for, and we've discovered  or they've discovered leaks in the system that can be  can speak to why they were over pumping. And at a certain point, they pumped 16.993 million gallons per day, but they  again, they're reducing pumping Waiawa Shaft, I think partly due to some efficiency measures, and also, they had fixed  there was a big leak in the Pearl Harbor Peninsula that they fixed. And so you see that their 12-month moving average as of May 2023 is 14.9 mgd, which is below their allocation.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"And again, just a leak in the water system just for verification because that was  we did this presentation prior, and there was concern that it was in the actual fuel system. No, it's the water system that Ryan's talking about.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Thank you. Yeah, that  I should have been a little clearer about that. I think it was  it was those kinds of water distribution leaks that you see in all big water systems, right, Board of Water Supply. And so they discovered one. And I think this is  I think maybe that's part of the silver lining in this whole situation is it  it's caused us to put a lot more scrutiny on the Navy's data with respect to both the pumpage, aquifer health, and  and particularly salinity. So this slide shows the current pumpage, and then you'll see that, okay, Aiea-Halawa Shaft is basically offline. Waiawa Shaft, they were brought  you know, they brought their pumpage down below their allocation. Red Hill Shaft, again below their allocation, although this is for plume containment. This is not feeding into the system. And you'll see that the combined 12-month moving average is 18.972 from 20.363 as of November of 2021. So can they sustain running the system with one source? Yes. Is that a good idea? Probably not, because if Waiawa Shaft pulls down, they don't have water for their system. The one thing that we  we wanted to make sure that we looked at was chlorides  and  because chlorides give us an indication of aquifer health too. And so this is a plot of chlorides. So you'll see this scale is pumpage in million gallons per day. This scale is parts  in terms of parts per million. So you see some variability. The orange dots are the chlorides, and you see some variability, but it's relatively  pretty stable and pretty good at about maybe 130, 130 parts per million. Waiawa Shaft is the one that I think we're really  that we're a lot more interested in because as they increase pumpage from Waiawa Shaft to support the system, what does that tell us about the chlorides? Well, the chlorides  I mean, this is  it's relatively fresh water, right? Like between 35 and maybe a high of 44 parts per million. So we see  we see some variability with respect to pumpage, but not too much That takes me through the Navy's water sources. Did you guys have any questions on that section before we move on?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Ryan, Aurora has a question.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"So Waiawa pumping is declining, but we're heading into summer, and do you have any  in general, that's, you know, high water demand time is  I mean, the implication there is that it's probably not going to continue going down over the summer and they will be exceeding that specific  likely be exceeding that specific allocation for that. So what measures or have there been any dialogues around that?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"I mean, I can start, Ryan, real quick. The graph here shows summer month usage. So if you look at it on the 12 MAV, they still fall within their allocation.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"So, in the bottom frames, right?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"You know, basically July through August or that period, those are summer months where you would see higher use. So, I mean, in general, we are  we're  what's been great is they've been reporting daily pumpage (inaudible).",0,C1,06/20/2023
Which we  we don't ask of anybody,0,C1,06/20/2023
"So the Navy's been really, really, really good at getting us this data; that's the only reason why we're able to track it at this scale",0,C1,06/20/2023
"over time. And then we  it is on a 12 MAV, right",0,C1,06/20/2023
"with the idea that during summer periods, there might be increased pumping to meet demands and needs, but we also ramp up our conservation efforts working with our planning office and our conservation work. So those are some of the strategies, at least right now, we're working with the Navy  even anybody throughout the state on is conservation strategies and drought preparedness.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Right, yeah. 'Cause it's not looking  you know, the prospects are not looking great.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"It is gonna be a prolonged drought per  per models, right, and predictions. So, Ryan, sorry. Sorry to jump in, but go ahead.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"No, no. No, that's a  that's a great thing to add. So we also  as Kaleo mentioned, we are looking a both pumpage and chloride data on a finer scale. And normally, what we would require of any well owner or shaft owner or whatever is monthly water use and monthly chloride data to be submitted. We  because of this  because of the concern that we brought up not just for the summer months, but just in general as they increase the pumpage, we were  we were looking at daily pumpage and weekly chloride data to be submitted so that we can kind of start to get a handle, are we seeing  are we seeing chloride starting to increase as their pumping higher? Again, if this is  if the past, you know, two years of data is any indication, I don't think we're going to see chloride increases if  you know, as they approach the summer months. But we'll continue to keep a handle on the data and  present anything to you if we see that anything is  you know, if there's any adverse impacts on the aquifer.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Okay, thanks. So I'll  I'll move on to the next  the final section. I wanted to give you guys a briefing on the Navy monitor well permit. So it's  this is  this is an interesting  and I should preface this by saying that typically the commission approves well permits for  I mean, I would say 90 percent of our permitting is for production-type wells, right, where people drill wells to produce water permit deep monitor wells and permanent deep monitor wells, but a lot of environmental wells that are being done to assess, you know, aquifer water quality are done through  you know, via the underground storage tank program at DOH or other environmental programs. So typically, we hadn't been  been permitting these types of environmental monitor wells. Well, back in around, I think, 2015, and maybe prior to that, we started permitting the monitor wells for the Navy. And I think it's a good  it's a good thing for the commission to be involved because, as we know, there's contamination in the area. For the Navy to be constructing the wells in accordance with our well standards will help us to ensure that if there's contamination in the vadose or the unsaturated zone above the aquifer, you know, adhering to our well standards will help prevent a contaminant from entering the aquifer from above. And not to say that DOH wouldn't be able to do that, but I think our well standards are  are sufficiently designed to protect both that from happening and also from maybe perched water from entering an ungrouted annular space and entering the basal nodes. So  so all that to say that we have been permitting Navy monitor wells. There are 23 existing Navy monitor wells right now in all  all of these various locations. There are eight new proposed Navy monitor wells that we have applications in for that we're under  that are under review. This shows the location of monitor wells with respect to the fuel tank farm. So this is the fuel tank farm right here And then water quality data from the monitor well  so we don't have the expertise within groundwater to analyze water quality data, but thank you to Commissioner Seto for sending me this yesterday. Here are some websites that anybody can go to, the commissioners and general public can go to get water quality data from the monitor wells. So there's the  DOH's Red Hill information website. There's the EPA's groundwater results application which was just released, I think, last month or two months ago. And then there's the Navy's Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Red Hill environmental website And that's basically all I  oh-oh. Start the recording again?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, you can just press start recording, Kathy.",0,C1,06/20/2023
It's connecting. Like it's not sensing or something.,0,C1,06/20/2023
So can we confirm,0,C1,06/20/2023
Is it  is it on,0,C1,06/20/2023
It's a hard connection.,0,C1,06/20/2023
"Okay, there we go.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Okay, there we goSo that concludes my presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions that you guys have or  I think I see Commissioner Seto smiling, so I'll deflect some questions to her too, but  okay, thank you.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, Ryan, thanks a lot. I know the monitoring wells are critical, especially the ones in the west, to get a much better idea of what's in the aquifer and the plume flow. And I know we've got some issues with liability and trying to put the appropriate monitoring wells in, but let's say we put them in there  and again, the  the commission's kuleana is really gonna be long-term aquifer remediation and recovery. What kind of time frame  assuming we get the wells in  did you project before we could start making some determinations kind of the plume? And I know theoretical, we don't know, but this is an issue that is gonna be with the commission for quite a while. Do you have any  any projections of time frames once the monitoring wells are in for us to begin to draw some  some kind of rational, you know, observations?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, and I don't want to misspeak, and Joanna's certainly here to correct me if I say anything wrong or  or even expand on what I might say. But I know that initially  was it at an FTAC, a Fuel Tank Advisory Committee meeting, Joanna, that I think either EPA or DOH presentesort of  some sort of spatial analysis on plume locations? But I don't know that there's been a time series to represent any sort of changes with respect to how plume containment was  and maybe  and so I'll let Commissioner Seto sort of expand on that if she can.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Just real quick, Ryan, most of the monitoring wells are just around the  the Red Hill facility. We really have not collected data  the wells aren't even in yet, so (inaudible)",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, thank you. So I will say that I think that there are  like the majority, I'd say just about all of the wells are Navy wells. I know that the Board of Water Supply has, I believe, one monitor well in, and I believe they're applying or are looking to apply for one or two more. So I think that the  you know, I kind of see where you're going with this because I know we had talked about this before, but I'm trying to establish sentinel wells between the fuel tank facility and  and Halawa Shaft. But I don't  I don't have a timeline for the  for that. I think that's a  that's going to be a Board of Water Supply question.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"But with an assumption, basically we're talking years having to put the wells in, and hopefully we'll get that done, and then actually getting the data over a certain amount of time frames until there's comfort level that Board of Water Supply could open up their shafts again. That's really more like years rather than months.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"That  you know, that's kind of hard to say. I mean, the  we, staff has been sort of  staff has been addressing the deep  the monitor well applications as fast as we can in order to aid in the  in assessing what's happening. And, you know, they've been coming in for maybe  I want to say maybe 15 wells a year or so, and they've been getting them online relatively quickly, maybe  maybe within about a year. Again, I'm not  I can't speak on behalf of the Navy, but they've expanded out their drilling sort of roster into maybe three or four drillers at this point, whereas they only had one driller prior. And I think they're just trying to accelerate drilling monitor wells all over the place. So it's hard for me to say, but based on the plan, it would appear maybe within a year or two as far as what has been planned so far, I think all of the wells should be in place and online. I  that's my best estimate.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"And, Commission Buck, maybe real quick, we did make a request  because they are collecting data now in whatever wells have been completed  to the Navy in their next quarterly update, which is next month, unfortunately, to provide kind of like  if possible, a summary of what they're seeing.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"You know, we have some wells completed. What is the data showing now, and can that help to inform some of our management decisions? So we put in the requests and hoping to get some report back from the Navy next month.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"I mean, I've been to the meetings. The Navy is  we're ready, they're ready to go. The major issue is a lot of them are on private land",0,C1,06/20/2023
"and the private land owner is not comfortable. They want some liability protection in case they find something, and so that's  and I know DOH has been working with  I mean, that's something, but  yeah, until we get those west monitoring wells in, we're still  really have  don't have much of an idea",0,C1,06/20/2023
of what's going on.,0,C1,06/20/2023
It's definitely isolated around the fuel facility.,0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah. Ryan, do you have a  an opportunity to sort of  I don't know if synthesize is the right word, but take in, like, EPA, Board of Water Supply, and  and put them all together so that we have a  a larger visual of all of the different wells? And are they all  are they all in sync, or are they different? Or what impacts do those additional well information have for you?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, let me think about this. So I think that at a certain point, we did a  we did a collaborative effort with USGS. Shoot, I can't  I wish Patrick were here. Patrick is our geologist that can  and Bob, I wish they were here talking about how they calibrated the elevation surveys of all of the wells in the area But in terms of syncing data, I mean, I think that the websites that I had mentioned have results of all of monitor wells in the area. I'm not sure that they have permission receipt  I don't think they have Board of Water Supply data in the area, but there's only one Board of Water Supply monitor well, so  yeah, I think that that would be the best opportunity to see data results from, you know, a more comprehensive scale.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"And maybe just  you know, a lot of  we trust in our link, right?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"So we're really focusing on a lot of times the aquifer health from a quantity and chloride perspective, which is kind of the sweet spot we fit in in relation to Department of Health, EPA, who is  is managing the water quality data sets from these well fields. PuttinJune",0,C1,06/20/2023
"to try to do more of and be better at, but a lot of the focus has been quality metrics that have been presented. So we can talk about it and see if there's a way for us to use some of maybe the existing data sharing sites that DOH or EPA or the Navy has set up, and then plug in some of our, you know, quantitative data",0,C1,06/20/2023
Okay. And maybe that's a  that's a task for UH.,0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, I was gonna suggest  I mean, you know, the USGS is",0,C1,06/20/2023
"very well  you know, they have a really stronger group of geologists, hydrologists, and then UH as well. So I think kind of helping the different organizations find their role in  in the  sort of the network would be good. And I think oftentimes from the researcher's side, you know, people want to help, but they don't know what the right questions are",0,C1,06/20/2023
"and they don't know where the data is. And once the data is available, they",0,C1,06/20/2023
People get very excited when there's (inaudible).,0,C1,06/20/2023
I'll pass that word back.,0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yes. Thank you, Ryan. Any  has any board members  commission have any questions for Ryan or staff?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"I  sorry, I have one other.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"So this is going back to the chlorides being stable at Red Hill Shaft, and I was wondering because Halawa's shut off, you know, I mean  and Halawa used to be a big draw, is  do you think that plays into the chloride story there or it's just the aquifer can handle and, you know?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"You know, that's a  that is a good question. I would have to look at the data for  the water use reported data from Red Hill Shaft and compare that to, you",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Again, if our theory or if our geologist's theory holds true, that large influx of water from the Koʻolaus would  would maybe  could possibly suggest that the shutdown of Halawa Shaft wouldn't impact Red Hill Shaft in a significant way.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Any other questions or comments? Do we have  Jonathan, you've been with us the whole meeting. Did you wanna  were you here to participate on a particular item?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Not at this time, mahalo. Other than I was going to, when it comes to it, thank Commissioner Buck for his years of service.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Oh, okay. Thank you very much. I thought so. Okay. Anybody else?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"So my takeaway is generally good news, nothing disturbing in your  in the data you presented, Ryan?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Well, not from a water quality standpoint, right, because again, we can't really",0,C1,06/20/2023
"We can't really comment on  on the perspective of the presence of contaminants in the aquifer. As far as aquifer health and depletion, that's really where  again, as Kaleo mentioned, that's our sweet spot, right? So based on our increased monitoring of what's happening with respect to Waiawa Shaft and looking at our deep monitor well data, we are relatively confident that any changes in system pumpage isn't affecting the aquifers in a negative way.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Okay, thank you.  And second to Kaleo, the last  I don't know if it was last month or the month before, the Navy made a presentation which really created an opportunity to kind of create a dashboard of various important task completions or objectives and milestones that we could track. Have we kind of done anything with that? Will we be seeing that on some routine basis, quarterly perhaps, or some",0,C1,06/20/2023
"I'm hoping to try to figure out whether it's some kind of informational briefing submittal that we have that we can kind of evaluate what we're seeing related to what they've presented or just have the Navy present on those three things every quarter. So they've agreed  I've consistently reached out, and they agreed to be back in July to update us on those kind of three focal points of the work that they're doing. I'm hopeful that until the fuel is removed or the facility is closed, that they're committed  at least we've gotten commitments from leadership right now that they'll be here. So it is  those three threads and those focuses are where we want to have them provide those updates.",0,C1,06/20/2023
But I like the idea of kind of keeping the destination targets,0,C1,06/20/2023
"solid, and then measuring milestone and progress",0,C1,06/20/2023
of those milestones along the way.,0,C1,06/20/2023
"I think one of the  in my opinion, kind of seeing the big picture of things, that the biggest issue is the remediation.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"And we haven't got there yet. Right? The focus right now has been on defueling safely the facility. But, you know, I think we've been really consistent at the Fuel Tank Advisory Commission  Committee meetings and others, at our subject matter expert meetings, that we've really got to start thinking about what does remediation look like for this  these aquifers.",0,C1,06/20/2023
and start that conversation now and not afterwards when you're done reviewing. But we need to have those conversations now,0,C1,06/20/2023
and set those goals. We can change,0,C1,06/20/2023
"as we get more data, but we really need to, yeah, know where it is we're going.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Hi, Ryan. Has the Navy formed and stood up an organization to meet your expectations moving forward to provide you timely data? And how does that",0,C1,06/20/2023
organization look as to what they've had historically there?,0,C1,06/20/2023
"I mean, what we're  I guess it depends on what you mean by what we're looking at. From staff's perspective, we are primarily looking at getting like a finer-tuned reporting of their water use, which that  that came from NAVFAC directly. So in that sense, no As Kaleo mentioned, we are  the commission is part of the  both the Fuel Tank Advisory Committee as well as various subject matter expert groups, maybe the most significant being the Remediation Roundtable. So as far as particular commission objectives, yeah, there's  there's really  there's really nothing that we look at in terms of a larger group. Although, you know, informally, we do consult with several geologists throughout the state about geologic issues as they pertain to monitor wells. Otherwise, commission staff is advisory to the Field Tank  well, we're a part of the Fuel Tank Advisory Committee as well as subject matter experts.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Well, Ryan, is there an opportunity  one of the, to me, issues is that your groundwater staff is sort of limited. Could we avail the Navy's conscience and hopefully, you know, some of their accountability to help improve getting groundwater data to you to  you know, what would normally be your function in doing it, but take advantage of that if they're putting in, you know, 35 sentinel wells around the area? Can we",0,C1,06/20/2023
task them to do more?,0,C1,06/20/2023
"That's a great question and  and actually, timely for me to let you know that the legislature approved four positions under groundwater regulation for that very purpose. So, you know, my thing has always been I would prefer for us to be collecting the data rather than the Navy to be collecting the data because, you know, validation  data validation is an issue. And for us to do that stuff, it gives me much more confidence that we can make better assessments on aquifer health. So we did get four new positions. I'm in the process of trying to figure out how to fill those positions and how to write the position description, so  but whether the Navy can contribute to that, yeah, I would love that, you know.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Well, I think they're obligated to do something.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Now, if I can add to that, so, you know, the  well, the State of Hawai‘i, the state and the counties created this unified statement. Part of the  the goal of this unified statement or this coalition is to bring all of the different agencies together, including the county, to hold the  the Navy accountable for more than just remediation. I mean, so we sit on that, and, you know, my concern is it's  it's not just water quality and water quantity, but the health of our ecosystem. Like what impact does this have to the nearshore waters, up on the streams, up mauka? So we are trying to leverage the Navy through this opportunity to require them to do more data, you know, have them responsible because there's a whole question as to, as you say, Ryan, the validation. I mean, we're only getting information from what the Navy's providing us. We are not having the opportunity to necessarily ground truth that. And that's why to me, having collaboration with other  you know, other monitoring wells, whether the Board of Water Supply  but I think it  right now is the opportunity for us to hold the Navy accountable. Because if our  our goal is not just, you know, clean water with infiltration. I mean, far from that. I mean, we want to be able to have clean water for future generations that doesn't have to all have to go through filtration. We also want to have clean water so our resources are taken care of. So the  part of the mission of this unified statement, this coalition, is to draft federal legislation and to get money to finance this. And it shouldn't be funded by the State of Hawaiʻi; it should be financed by the United States. So we are, as we're speaking, going through that process to try to be very comprehensive and inclusive and bring the right people to the table to begin to identify what's  you know, what's our long-term goal, and then working backwards, how do we  how do we get sufficient information, data, resources to get us to that point. So we are being very",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah. Any other questions or comments to staff, Ryan or anybody else, on this update? And Kaleo's right, I think, you did confirm with the Navy they'll be here,",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, they'll be here next  in July.",0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah. So they are keeping to their commitment to do quarterly updates to us following up on that first meeting. So with that, being this was just an informational briefing, right?",0,C1,06/20/2023
"So, having no other comments or questions, thank you very much, Ryan, for a very comprehensive overview.",0,C1,06/20/2023
And think of all our (inaudible).(Laughter.),0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, yeah, you're right. I'm trying",0,C1,06/20/2023
And throwing ones at the wall.,0,C1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, there you go.",0,C1,06/20/2023
I'm sure we've got plenty more.,0,C1,06/20/2023
"I want to be cautiously optimistic about the  the data that you gave us and the health, but, you know, preliminary, we've still got a lot more. So with that being said, this item is closed and",0,C1,06/20/2023

It encompasses many of these elements. (Slide presentation attached.)",0,C1,04/18/2023
are you coordinating or is the school of public health interested in your research and the effects climate change has on public health and the environment?,0,C1,04/18/2023
it’s an open research question. I’m sure there’s an interest in that. I’m not particularly working with anybody in public health but it’s certainly an area to explore and certainly something that they might be able to utilize.,0,C1,04/18/2023
"as you were going through this, I was thinking this is something that we could probably use.",0,C1,04/18/2023
It’s just a matter of identifying the type of data needed and getting it to the people that need it.,0,C1,04/18/2023
"thank you Dr. Longman and his team saying that his presentation was the most precise, accessible presentation ever heard from the University of Hawai‘i. I have never seen or was aware of many of those products. I have one question and one comment for future potential work for them. The question is: I know these are based on certain climatic models. What's the plan to verify the models and update some of the existing fact sheets that you have? And the comment is: a future need that we have, and it really relates to an issue we're dealing with today is the commission has really looked at some of these large episodic storm events as opportunities for our dams and reservoirs for water storage, but we do lack sometimes is the actual science that can kind of predict the amounts of some of these episodic storm events that can help us do some of the financial analysis to really help the majority of private landowners to see if they can maintain these dead dams and reservoirs. Episodic storm events are hard to model but that is one data element that as you look for future needs, I know the Water Commission could really use. Thank you for a great presentation and great work.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"to the comment first, saying with the Mesonet coming online. This is data that is available in five-minute resolution. We may not be able to predict what’s going to happen in the future but can get a really good idea of how much rainfall the storms are bringing to the island now once they have that high-resolution data. I think that that could be a model for what could happen in the future. If you can determine how storms might change you can base it on the information that you have but until they have that really high temporal resolution data. The second, that Mesonet station gets installed, and they have about 20 installed right now they start using that data. They start pulling it into the portal in real-time with data acquisition and product development. In terms of the question, a lot of the products and they’re developing like the rainfall maps, and temperature maps are all work that they’ve spent years on. They have been working on the Hawai‘i climate data portal for a decade and conceptually for two decades. If you go back to Tom’s (Thomas Giambelluca) tenure probably 4 decades, I don’t want to date Tom too much, but it’s been a while so the work that they do, and the mapping they publish that in peer viewed scientific journals. The future projections is not on their shop it’s on the periphery and can only use what’s out there so when folks develop something they make use of it but it’s just a matter of more folks putting their head down and looking into the future and then us utilizing and leveraging their efforts to get that information to folks in Hawai‘i.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"(thanked Dr. Longman for the presentation saying it was excellent) I was struck by your data utilization and your data life cycle slide. But there was something missing from that. You get to dissemination and what I was looking for was data utilization. Once we have the information what do we do with it? I think it’s really important and that’s why I said the implications which may not be so much on you as so much on our DLNR leadership and so forth that we recognize how then do we take this and have sounder policies. Then I looked at your models, your co-production models which I appreciate are better than the other options that you presented before it. I guess we’re not just looking at the value of information for its own sake so that we can adapt to here’s the trajectory and here is where we will end up so here’s how we’re going to live. I think part of our job is to really optimize, develop optimal strategies and move us toward a strategic optimization model. So that we’re again sensibly taking the information we have and making better policies. What comes back to Commissioner Buck is we just read in the paper Civil Beat today and we’re thinking what do you do with one reservoir? Kalihiwai reservoir on Kaua‘i. We’re going to close another reservoir and there’s a big dispute over the investment value of that and who bears that investment. Those are great examples of how we need to take the information that you’re providing and really put it in the hands of policymakers and make better decisions that are informed by your science. I’m not sure if that’s a statement or a question but I’d really like some discussion on that from both you as well as our staff.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"(Thanked Commissioner Hannahs). I often get this question. My capacity is at a limit when it gets to that dissemination point considering all the things that I'm doing. But you want your data and your work to have value and I'm not in the Ivory Tower approach so when I get to the dissemination part you would hope that in the co-production model that you're actually creating something that somebody wants, and they will utilize it. I have gotten feedback from people like Sierra McDaniel at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park who has used the information to make restoration decisions on planting silver sword species and for managing invasive species during certain times of the year. I'm getting some anecdotal information from folks that are using it for in terms of the ranchers in Hawai‘i. The ranchers have to make decisions and what's going to happen is they're going to either make the decision with no information or they're going to make it based on some information that we provide them. I'm not telling them what to do but it's a piece of information they can have that they might not have access to on the other hand. I can say is that we want to create the data and information the most relevant information for folks to utilize and find out what they need and give it to them in a format they can use.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"Ranching is a good example; you can look at your data in one decision you could adapt and reduce the stocking rate but when we have community goals to increase food production, we’ve got to take your data and figure out how do we have the stocking rate we want on our ranch lands that meet our food production goals and make sense with respect to the burden upon the land and the utilization of the resource. It’s not all your kuleana we need our public policy representatives in this to step forward.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"No, I think the goal is to utilize the data both in short-term and long-term decision-making. Reflecting on our kuleana to manage permits for example and bring forward recommendations to the Commission to the extent that we have a robust data set to work off the better. The trends are what we’ve been most interested in from a long-term Hawai‘i Water Plan perspective and for you folks as decision-makers and policymakers to make decisions based on new relevant Hawai’i-specific data versus these larger climate models that we’ve been basing our decisions off of.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"(thanked Dr. Longman) I have a question and then I have an offer. One, for the Hawai‘i Rangeland Information Portal which is super cool. Are you folks thinking about sort of intermediate range like two-to-three-year projections? I think that sometimes the scale at which decision-making happens; if you're going to manage head and all it's also like the El Niño kind of windows that are extremes that really swing decision-making. Three months is good, but I remember working in cattle country and that window of time was kind of important.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"the ranchers that we've talked to and work with, Hawai‘i Cattleman’s Council. On a day-to-day management level, we're finding that they're interested in the short term mostly. But I think it's probably some larger planning thoughts as you're looking into developing in the future. The information is useful on that but I'm very careful, I'm not a modeler in terms of what I do so, it's an almanac perspective, it just says that this happened past El Niño, this is what happens on average. It’s a real kind of careful way to get into that space in terms of projections. Now we can show the data and talk about what happened yesterday, last month, and what we think is going to happen, but I don't know if I have the capabilities to move too far into the future. But if that information is available in a robust way, we're happy to provide it to anybody that wants it and put it into the portfolio. That is something that we can do on a gridded basis.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"In that case, I have a follow-up or preceding question. Which is, you were talking about the data life cycle and about the knowledge exchange which I think kind of closed the loop. I noticed there was an arrow back, but we start with the kind of sensory data I think you and are very familiar with. But what room is there to include other indicators based on the feedback with stakeholders? Maybe we're not measuring the right things. Is there a way to incorporate those recommendations, maybe not in your project but are they documented and placed somewhere for the future? Maybe we're not measuring the right metrics that matter to the stakeholders.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"The portfolio is something we can do for anybody. So, we make the portfolio, and the next step would be to sit down with the stakeholder and go through the portfolio and say here is the information that you need. What else can we provide for you there? Then the idea of the knowledge exchange is to document lessons learned to get any information we can and compile it into a centralized clearing house to create these drought needs assessments; these things that encapsulate the broader issues and maybe even specific issues that might be relevant to other folks. So, there is that part of the exchange also it's kind of bringing together information from individuals and putting it in a cohesive way where others can kind of learn from those lessons.",0,C1,04/18/2023
that's kind of where the incorporation of local knowledge comes in but it's not something you carry out. Is it just something you document?,0,C1,04/18/2023
it's more documenting and disseminating it to others that might be interested in that information.,0,C1,04/18/2023
"Maybe as I sit on the commission for a couple more years, we can have more informal dialogues and think about ways that the continuing work of Hawaii Climate Data Portal (HCDE) and PDKE more directly guide commission work. This is focused on drought, but I think Dr. YinPhan Tsang, when we're thinking about extremes, she's doing a lot of work on flooding and there's going to be more work done on flooding. She works with folks on Kaua‘i as well so that would be a good complimentary informational briefing.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"The Pacific drought knowledge exchange is not limited to drought information and will also include flooding information. A fire risk and warning tool is being funded at a high resolution by Sayed Bateni at the Water Resource Research Center. The goal of the HCDP is to achieve water balance for the state, which will incorporate information on rainfall, runoff, aquifer recharge, and evapotranspiration. Dr. YinPhan Sang is developing a gridded soil moisture product to allow for effective precipitation analysis. The ultimate goal of the HCDP is to provide a comprehensive water balance for the state, which will take a couple more years to achieve.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"(thanked Dr. Longman for his work) I’ve been in the water and water management business for over 40 years. Your information is tremendously valuable to water utilities, public and private professionals, farmers, ranchers, and the public in terms of warning about drought and flood events. I feel that this work is filling a significant gap in the field and encourage you to continue the excellent work.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"(thanked Dr. Longman for his presentation) This has helped me gain perspective. I’m interested in understanding the timing of climate cycles and how your research can help in long-term water balance decision making. Who are the decision makers that you work with in developing this model, and how do you determine which areas to focus on? Specifically, about whether high-risk or low-tolerance areas for weather swings are prioritized. Overall, I’m seeking to gain a better understanding of your work and how it can be applied to address climate change.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"For the first question regarding whom they are working with on modeling projects, they take a stakeholder approach and work with those who are willing to collaborate with them. There is no specific targeting involved, and it is more about networking and the capacity to help. We can make a portfolio quickly for anyone. Overall, our approach is flexible and open to collaboration.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"who are the decision makers that you are collaborating with at these various sites that you've selected? Our collaboration partners vary depending on the project and location. We work with the resource management unit in Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park and individuals who manage land resources such as ranchers. We aim to work with people who will actually use the tools and data and try to identify them early on. I am currently working with the Hawai‘i Cattleman’s Council to meet with individuals who manage livestock and see if this tool can help them. We also work with organizations such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service, USGS, and Nature Conservancy, who put us in touch with the right people. It is really a grassroots project, and there is no specific model for identifying resource managers.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"Your research, what is the window for climate trends?",0,C1,04/18/2023
"the climate in Hawai‘i has crazy annual variability with wet and dry years. The last eight of nine years have been the hottest on record and the next El Niño could send temperatures off the charts. We’ve been in a La Niña for the last three years so we have not felt the full effects of what the atmosphere and the ocean is doing and the next El Niño could occur next winter and bring a hot and dry winter. Rainfall trends are uncertain, but temperatures are rising, and models predict a much warmer environment in Hawaii in the future. This will cause species, certain agricultural products, and people’s health and comfort to be at risk. Mitigation efforts are somewhat working, but we need to plan for a warmer world without any doubt.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"well, I think that's a challenge for this group is how do we protect our water resources so we can continue to enjoy a healthy and vibrant lifestyle. So, I think this research is key. We really need to have the ability to make long-term decisions that will protect our future so hopefully, you can help us. There are a lot of (Commission-designated) Water Management Areas on Maui that could probably benefit from your work.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"I have some final comments. I really appreciated this presentation and as a process person in support of community engagement, I view the tool as leveling the playing field, providing access to information for informed decision-making without paying for a consultant. The tool is helpful for various issues, including climate change, shoreline erosion, and trends in water issues. I believe that the tool will assist in making informed decisions and provide greater flexibility in incorporating changes into permit conditions. I appreciate the cultural integration and indigenous knowledge incorporated into the tool and praise its balance, credibility, and integrity. Finally, I’d like to thank the staff for their excellent work and believes that the department will use the tool frequently.",0,C1,04/18/2023
"thank you Chair Chang for your comments. I like your idea about making the tool a part of the staff protocol. He suggests highlighting the relevant data sets, including agency reviews and the Ka Pa‘akai Analysis, and creating a template for staff to ensure that there is a review against those data sets for matters that come before us. I believe that this is possible and I think that creating a template will make it automatic for staff to check the relevant data sets.",0,C1,04/18/2023
I agree that the tool can be incorporated into their discussions on climate data and that I can work with staff to utilize the data in their analysis and recommendations. I suggest that building the tool into their routing and review process can make their submittals more robust. I believe that we can make the water plan a living document by utilizing the tool and incorporating it into our discussions.,0,C1,04/18/2023
"thank you Commissioner Hannahs and Deputy Manuel for your input and I suggest a formalized way to pull in the HCDP or PDKE information as part of the assessment. I believe that this could be a tangible way to make it happen. Thank you Dr. Ryan Longman, how to access the HCDP or PDKE and his contact information for the general public who may be interested in following up?",0,C1,04/18/2023
could make the slides from the PowerPoint available to post on CWRM website so people can have access to it?,0,C1,04/18/2023
or links to it?,0,C1,04/18/2023
"you can access the Hawaii Climate Data Portal and the Pacific Drought Knowledge Exchange by simply searching on Google. I didn’t really get into the weeds on the portal, but the Hawaii Climate Data Portal offers an interactive tool where one can make a rainfall map, and real-time data can be accessed through an API. Cyberinfrastructure can also help with accessing the data. Currently for the portfolio, one has to email me or the HCDP, but eventually, it will be a tool for everyone.",0,C1,04/18/2023
Briefing on the Status of West Maui Water Use Permit Applications Regarding Honokōwai Aquifer System by Commission Staff,0,C3,06/18/2024
PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Deputy Dean Uyeno,0,C3,06/18/2024
"Staff provided an update on the process for groundwater and surface water permits in Honokōwai, Honolua, and Honokōhau Hydrologic Units.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"Puʻukoliʻi, so in the next map this is kind of all the developments that either have been completed, are on the books or are being proposed or in the process.",0,C3,06/18/2024
Your prior slides were existing users?,0,C3,06/18/2024
What was that again?,0,C3,06/18/2024
"Existing users, the prior slide.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"The prior slide, yes, these are all the existing applications that came.",0,C3,06/18/2024
Did you clarify that with the Land Use Commission? They had not submitted an application.,0,C3,06/18/2024
"I believe she was going to, I can't recall exactly our email communication but she said, got it.",0,C3,06/18/2024
We're being blamed for a non-existent application? DEPUTY UYENO: Yeah.,0,C3,06/18/2024
"That satisfies the immediate issue before us, but the larger issue is that's a lot of uses for a small amount of water. Where will the Commission be going with that, balancing there?",0,C3,06/18/2024
"That's why we're focusing our efforts on Honokōwai first, especially since it's all ground water. We don't really have the complexities of dealing with the ground and surface water interactions and then when once we get there, then we'll move back up north towards Honokōhau, Honolua, and then start making our way south. After Honokōwai, we will start getting to the complexities of ground and surface water. There's the major diversion from Honokōhau is there which feeds municipal uses for both private and public developments.",0,C3,06/18/2024
Any progress on the county side with the treatment of the wastewater?,0,C3,06/18/2024
"I'm not sure where we last left it, but I think they are more serious about it, but nothing that we've been apprised to.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"They’ve got other things on their plate. How does our Maui temp housing, the water that's being used for Maui temp housing fold into...because we've been saying if it's an existing use, we've been permitting it. If it's a new use, you've got to wait for our water management process.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"Correct, as of now close to all of the developments are being fed by the County. Those that may be fed by private are currently on hold and so until we get more information, we are moving forward with that. The only one is a small project which Hawaiʻi Water Service, I think it's only 50 homes on the golf course where they're building the temp housing for the workers. That's the only thing we need to assess.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"I think Commissioner Miike’s concern about, we're going to have a lot more challenges in this designation. We're just not going to have enough and I'm really worried about where we're going to...You’ve got so many different moving parts with the EP, the Maui temp housing, and the restoration of Lahaina.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"When is your vacation planned? Pardon me, that was really unfair. You're doing great, you really are.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"To Alexa's credit, when the whole admin bill thing came up, she was looking at the State Water Code review and I think was that the ’86? Back then they did recognize that the water shortage issues in West Maui and so back then they were already contemplating designation and we're in this situation now.",0,C3,06/18/2024
That doesn't make me feel any better.,0,C3,06/18/2024
"Dean, from what you know about this project in the back of the envelope, what do you think the water requirement is going to be?",0,C3,06/18/2024
"I have no idea, I can't recall what the...",0,C3,06/18/2024
"That's a new use, too, right?",0,C3,06/18/2024
"They have a master plan for the development, so I'm sure it's on the book somewhere. I just haven't looked at it closely.",0,C3,06/18/2024
That would give you sort of an idea of what the pressure is going to look like literally.,0,C3,06/18/2024
I think that's where the reuse is going to be very important because that may free up a lot of water that would otherwise be used for irrigation.,0,C3,06/18/2024
"I'm out of touch a bit but with respect, you asked the question about the water reuse plan from the Lahaina treatment plant and my understanding is R1's been available for quite a while, like three years now. It's been used primarily along the coast for irrigation, production of the treatment plant. Negotiations are continuing for acquisition of a larger reservoir further up the hill that will provide distribution of the R1 water, wider spectrum. Of course it would have to be pumped up to Puʻukoliʻi to be used up there, but that's project cost. It's my understanding that negotiations are continuing and they're headed in the right direction with respect to acquisition of an old ag reservoir. It's still in use, in pretty good shape and that would solve a lot of the distribution and reuse questions.",0,C3,06/18/2024
There's a map on the County website that does show their plans going up to that higher reservoir.,0,C3,06/18/2024
"My connection might be a little unstable. I just wanted to offer a little bright spot at least for me is that the Water Resources Research Center, we've got a lot of new faculty coming in including a drinking water specialist. We have wastewater - very energetic and in a second year wastewater specialist. I hope we can really build some stronger bridges with the agencies and take advantage of that. I don't want to throw Emily under the bus, but she's done potable reuse in different places on the continent. I hope just knowing that there are specialists at UH, I hope they can inform that really important work.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"I really have a lot of catching up to do with regards to the situation in West Maui and in particular my interest is the R1 use. I’m sorry, Fred, is that your name tag? It's very hard to read on Zoom. It was very educational for me, I'm making some contacts there in Maui. I come from agriculture and I'm working with my brother in the Kuʻia area and the lack of water for agriculture is such an issue and so I'm just moving home and I'm trying to get caught up on where things are at, where the process is for bringing the R1 water farther south, hopefully. I’m trying to just get in the rooms where sometimes this is being talked about and explore who's been working on this, who's trying to help make this happen or what are the obstacles and if there are ways that I can kōkua to try to have it move forward. Not that I swing any big sticks, but I've got a lot of energy and I'm very passionate about this subject and agriculture and the community in Lahaina and West Maui and the environment. You'll probably see me more and I think it'll always be friendly, so don't worry. I just know the water wars have been going on in West Maui for a very long time. The fact that we haven't figured it out, how to utilize more of this R1 water that's been such a wasted resource, in my opinion, for so long is too bad and we can't let it continue. I think this is a great turning point and opportunity to especially with all of the interest for how can we improve things in Lahaina for climate resilience, for fuel load, for wildfire mitigation, for climate change resilience, all of the above reasons- the R1 kind of seems like a natural good candidate. That's where my interest is and I'm just trying to learn and trying to understand the history and the current status of things and looking for opportunities to maybe have conversations and try to move it forward or see if there's ways that we can help whoever's been trying to move it forward, to overcome whatever obstacles might be in the way.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"We thank you for joining us today, thank you very much.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"I’m here, I'm John Helly. My background is as a scientist in oceanography, Earth sciences and geophysics, sort of topics. I've been a resident of Maui for 23 years plus and currently a member of the Board of Water Supply. I'm not speaking for the Board of Water Supply, I'm not representing any points of view in that regard. I was here to understand the timing of the review process for the permits because despite what I just said, I'm a chair of a temporary investigative group for the Board of Water Supply and it's important to our planning as to when we expect to see these somewhere between 100 and 200 permit applications in order to review them effectively. However, I think the presentation by Dean addressed my main concern which is trying to get a status of the timing of all that and I'll just leave you with a comment that we have a meeting on Thursday that's going to be at least partially addressing some of the issues that were just under discussion and I'd encourage anyone interested to pay attention to that meeting, thank you.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"Thank you very much, John. Dean, what is your schedule for this?",0,C3,06/18/2024
"We were hoping to start bringing at least these applications to you for Honokōwai later this year, the end of this year. That's the hope. We're starting to get the letters out now, most if not all of them should go out this week and again this is just for Honokōwai Aquifer. 30 days for them to get the information back to us at which point we can initiate the public review and public notice process.",0,C3,06/18/2024
There's also an opportunity for filing a contested case?,0,C3,06/18/2024
"Well, the public notice will go out. If there are objections, we'll have to hold a public hearing. I believe at that point during the public hearing process, people could request a contested case hearing or when it gets brought before the Commission, there’s another opportunity.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"Dean, if you think of it, reach out and let me know when those public hearings are and what the site are? I’d like to follow that along. Thanks very much.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"That probably would be a good idea to have a Commission presence, too, since this is one of the first.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"I was just going to ask Mr. Helly, he mentioned the meeting that was upcoming, if he can share those details verbally with us.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"Just a moment, details of the schedule for the meeting?",0,C3,06/18/2024
"Yeah, you said there was a meeting this week.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"Yes, there's a meeting on Thursday, our monthly board meeting at 1:30 in the afternoon and there's an agenda published and it's on the County website. You can look for the Board of Water Supply and that'll lead you hopefully to the agenda. If you require more, I'd be happy to send the link.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"Commissioner Hannahs shares his closing remarks; he will be completing his tenure as Commissioner on June 30, 2024.",0,C3,06/18/2024
"Chair Chang, mahalo for affording me this opportunity to share some parting thoughts as I approach the conclusion of two terms of service on this Commission. After reading transcripts of the minutes of our meetings over the past eight years and finding the record of my remarks to be far more disjointed than what I had in mind, I am submitting this written version of my manaʻo to supplement my oral comments. The opportunity to assume a role in assuring the stewardship and availability of a life- enabling resource is a profound honor. I am grateful to Governor Ige for nominating me and to our State Senators for confirming my appointment. Thanks, as well, to Chairs Case and Chang, for guiding our work and to my fellow Commissioners who have been patient with my questions, respectful of my worldview and considerate of my positions. We have had a lot to do and owning to yeomen’s efforts of our dedicated staff, we have had full agendas. I observed this tone being set at the top when I visited Deputy Director Manuel one day. Kaleo had a white board on his wall that counted down the number of meetings that would occur under his watch because he believed that each meeting represented an opportunity to address the myriad issues before us. I took inspiration from his mission-driven mindset, and I am proud of what we have accomplished by working together with a sense of urgency. Our business has covered a wide range of issues and I found it beneficial to be collaborating with colleagues who bring diverse skills and experiences to each topic. • Impacts of climate change on rainfall, water recharge and sustainable yield. • Domestic requirements, well development, conservation and drought planning. • Pollution risks and the Red Hill crisis. • Wastewater treatment and dual system benefits. • Water Management Area designation. • Stream and marine biology, watersheds, biodiversity. • Cultural practices, kuleana rights and Ka Paʻakai analysis. • Sustainable food system goals, transmission efficiencies and reservoir storage. • Instream flow standards and riparian ecosystem services. • Permit streamlining and enforcement challenges. • Sunshine requirements, civic engagement and integration of stakeholder views. Some of the achievements that I found particularly gratifying include: • Resolving contested case disputes in East Maui, Nā Wai ʻEhā and Waimea, Kauaʻi that set instream flow standards and provided resources for off-stream use. • Gaining the Navy’s acceptance of responsibility for draining and repurposing Red Hill fuel tanks and remediating our ground water resources. • Designating Maui Komohana as a Water Management Area. • Returning water to Molokaʻi’s Kawela Stream. • Creating protocols that intensify our commitment to Ka Paʻakai analysis. In my humble opinion, our efforts to accomplish these and other successful outcomes were benefited by four factors. •A community that rises to the duty of civic engagement in a democratic system and shows up with knowledge of the topic, respect for the process and aloha ʻāina motivating their resolve. The work of staff who have diligently researched issues, consulted stakeholders and crafted policy-aligned recommendations for our consideration. Commissioners who draw upon their knowledge, experience and problem-solving tools to resolve disputes, balance beneficial interests and fulfill our duties. A humble perspective that elevates public trust considerations over our self- interests or the concerns of specific constituencies. My reflections on our efforts to manage Hawaiʻi’s cherished wai resources are in stark contrast to the adage that “whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting.” That might be what they do elsewhere, but I do not think that characterizes our philosophy over the past eight years. Nor do I believe it will help you as you tackle the work that lies ahead. By now, we should all have learned that conflict divides communities, impedes action, depletes natural resources and confounds financial viability. Our ancestral wisdom of ola i ka wai enlightens a more prudent path. Water is not something we should fight to own and control for our singular use. It is what we must sustainably manage to create the conditions we need to survive today and for generations to come. I will miss the work of the Commission and I will miss all of you. Part of me would like to continue, but I also realize that our community is blessed with a deep bench of Hawaiian cultural practitioners who can bring insights and values that are essential to your future deliberations and efforts to uphold the principles of Hawaiʻi’s Water Code. I hope the Governor expeditiously appoints a worthy successor with these qualities so that the Commission can “e pūpūkahi i holomua kākou!” Mahalo nui and aloha nō!",0,C3,06/18/2024
"We're gonna now move on to Item C2, Request to Authorize the Chairperson to Enter Into a Joint Funding Agreement With USGS to Collect and Enter Into Site-Specific Water Use Information in Hawai‘i, Statewide. Did this also include the EA exemption, Ayron?",1,C2,07/26/2023
"Okay, and the EA exemption. All right, very good. Presentation by the staff?",1,C2,07/26/2023
"Thank you, Chair. This is Ayron. Strauch with the stream protection management branch. Item C2 is to request to authorize the chairperson to enter into a joint funding agreement with US Geological Survey to collect and enter site-specific water use information for Hawai‘i and declare that the project is exempt from EA requirements. There is no formal presentation, although I will give a little bit of background information. At five-year intervals nationwide, the USGS collects water use data to characterize water use across the nation in a comprehensive and consistent manner for comparative purposes and to make recommendations at the federal level. In Hawai‘i, we've not had sufficient monitoring in major areas of water use for many, many years. We have gotten much better in the last since I was hired in 2014, and the major users such as hydropower and agriculture irrigation have now, at least at the largest scales, are now monitoring their systems much more effectively. There was a lot of information being gathered during the plantation era, but following the collapse of the plantation systems and the managers that we've had to monitor and manage effectively and just record the data, we lost many decades of information. But now, USGS is wanting to gather the information we have and enter it within their system, and they have federal funding to do this. This is a no-cost agreement to.. The commission. We just need to be the local partner in this effort. And because the commission already gathers the data from drinking water systems, both surface and groundwater data from irrigation systems, both surface and groundwater data from (inaudible) power systems, now that we've really worked statewide to get water users to report consistently, this data is now available for USGS to bring into their system to code it to their level of consistency for their federal or countrywide analysis. So with that, the staff recommends that the commission authorize the chairperson to enter into a joint funding agreement between the Commission on Water Resource Management and the US Geological Survey to collect and enter site-specific water use information for the state of Hawai‘i. This JFA will be funded solely by the USGS with no cost to the commission. Authorize the chairperson to accept further amendments and modifications to the contract agreement as may be necessary to accomplish the goals described here, provided that any amendment or modification does not require additional commission funding. Declare that the project is exempt from EA requirements under HRS Chapter 343 and HAR Chapter 11-200.1.",1,C2,07/26/2023
"Very good. Thank you, Ayron Commissioners, any questions? Oh, go ahead, Aurora.",1,C2,07/26/2023
I have one. This is for Ayron because USGS is not here today. How does it  do we have good data even in undesignated areas or,1,C2,07/26/2023
"So from  you know, I won't speak for groundwater, although I do know that they have done a lot of outreach statewide to get small groundwater wells to report, even though I believe domestic wells aren't required to report. Is that accurate?",1,C2,07/26/2023
"Right now, that's not the focus and priority (inaudible).",1,C2,07/26/2023
"Yeah, the focus is on the larger users.",1,C2,07/26/2023
"And we have pretty good reporting from all the larger users. On the surface water side, certain users, we've been getting consistent data for, like East Maui Irrigation or Wailuku Water, because they  that information has been tied to contested cases. Other systems, it's been much more recent. Like Department of Agriculture systems are  on the Big Island or the Molokai irrigation system, they  they were not monitoring their delivery system gathering metered end-use data, so we have that available that dates back now, maybe a decade or so. But the commission staff has installed and maintained monitoring stations for these systems as a  because they weren't gonna be able to do it. So we've also worked with large private irrigation system operators, whether it's Maui Land and Pine, whether it's Grove Farm, Kaua‘i Ranch, Kekaha Ag, which is ABC System, to develop monitoring programs and to help them maintain them. All the hydropower plants now are reporting their tail race data to us, which is a big win because now we have at least one sector of their  you know, the categories that USGS utilizes accomplished. I believe all of the drinking water systems that rely on surface water now also report their water use to us, so",1,C2,07/26/2023
Okay. So CWRM will ingest it and pass it to USGS to,1,C2,07/26/2023
organize and display and make available for everyone?,1,C2,07/26/2023
And it alleviates the workload in some sense.,1,C2,07/26/2023
"The USGS will coordinate with us on how they access the data, whether we set them up with a terminal in the office or we just compile lots of spreadsheets and just send them over there. We'll figure out the logistics later.",1,C2,07/26/2023
"But basically, they're going to fund the gathering and coding and analyzing of the data.",1,C2,07/26/2023
"Okay. The other thing I noticed in the submittal was that there's this untapped source of funding that we could potentially use in the future, the Water Use Data and Research Program, so will that help sustain kind of the effort moving forward?",1,C2,07/26/2023
(Inaudible) maybe this is (inaudible).,1,C2,07/26/2023
"Yeah, I mean, in general, I will say that Katie Roth with our planning program has been taking the lead on looking at how to double down on our state funding by looking and accessing federal funding where applicable and as appropriate. And so we are evolving in our access of federal resources. We have historically not accessed a lot of them, but that's something that we're open to as they align with our priorities or the things that we've been currently working on.-",1,C2,07/26/2023
"I just wanted to say this is great because it's gonna help us through water shortage planning with real data and assistance, technical assistance from USGS.",1,C2,07/26/2023
"Any other questions? I'm sorry, Aurora. Go ahead. Anything more?",1,C2,07/26/2023
"Any other questions, Commissioners?(No response.)",1,C2,07/26/2023
"Do any members of the public, either in the room or on Zoom, have any questions?(No response.)",1,C2,07/26/2023
"Okay. With that, do I have a motion?",1,C2,07/26/2023
Motion to approve. Do I have a second?,1,C2,07/26/2023
"The motion has been made and seconded to approve the staff recommendation. All in favor, say aye.(Response.)",1,C2,07/26/2023

Briefing Summarizing Select Legislation of Note Related to the Commission on Water Resource Management from 2023-2024 Legislative Biennium,0,B3,02/20/2024
Staff shared the status of House and Senate bills relating to or directly affecting CWRM.,0,B3,02/20/2024
"If I could just add to that. I didn’t want, knowing that the bill is from last year, and that the counties subsequently did raise concerns to the Governor about this. I met with the county as well as Chair Ichiyama encouraged and I told her that I was going to meet. I’ve met with the county, all the water departments. It was great conversation. I think we’re going to try to do this on a regular basis, meeting with the county water departments. I think that their opposition was more...because I said nobody opposed the bill during the hearing. Let me just put it this way, I think that they were and I’m not going to speak on behalf of the counties, they appreciated the outreach. I think they were more comfortable with an incremental increase rather than going up to the $60,000. I said, okay we will decrease it to $25,000 and I’m hoping that that will be a more acceptable compromise with the county water departments.",0,B3,02/20/2024
Was the Governor’s veto based on the counties’ objection? I mean he’s the big elephant in the room right now.,0,B3,02/20/2024
That’s my understanding. That’s why I said I will reach out to the county water department because I don’t want to waste people’s time if it’s going to be vetoed again but I think that was my guidance. Talk to the county water departments because that’s where the objection came from.,0,B3,02/20/2024
"LURF (Land Use Research Foundation) and the Hawaiʻi DWS (Department of Water Supply), I think in the initial hearing, Kauaʻi County had also provided testimony and subsequently I think only Hawaii Department of Water Supply and Honolulu Board of Water Supply had some testimony along with LURF and others. You may want to take a look at those testimony to see where their positions are.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"Let me ask you, what is the objection to a high penalty?",0,B3,02/20/2024
"I think the way the Code and the Bill points out is that it’s a daily fine. So, it could conceivably, theoretically end up at these high million-dollar fines right. We tend to work with the counties whenever we notice something or something happens with the wells. We measure on a 12-month moving average. We certainly work with even the counties and private purveyors whenever we’re setting instream flow standards. We try to work with them as much as possible.",0,B3,02/20/2024
What kinds of violations are we talking about?,0,B3,02/20/2024
"Could be anything, over-pumping, not meeting the instream flow standard. But in a lot of cases, especially like the instream flow standards. Understanding our staff and understanding how measurements take place and the difficulties in getting out to intakes, it’s difficult to accurately measure and maintain an instream flow standard especially when the weather is changing daily. We’re more apt to work with the diverters in those cases than to come down heavy with a fine, but if it’s a continued violation that we see and they’re not listening to our staff then that’s when we’ll tend to take an action.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"In addition to a penalty, can you take away? For example, if they have a well can we shut it down or if you’re doing a diversion, can we cut it off? That’s within the power of the Commission, right?",0,B3,02/20/2024
I think it’s possible. That may constitute a takings action that we would have to bring before the Commission.,0,B3,02/20/2024
"It seems to me that if you have a violator who doesn’t care about what the fine is and they keep on violating, but it every day there’s a fine...",0,B3,02/20/2024
"Alexa did an analysis of all of our violations, to a large extent, we’re not into punishment as we are into mitigation, do something and move. A lot of the violations have turned into mitigation measures but I think it is helpful to have a stick if you don’t get compliance, so looking at alternative ways to get people in compliance. I think for the objections to the $60,000 was we went from $5,000 all the way up to $60,000 even though we showed a real good rational basis. It was consistent with DOH, it followed EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). I think there was just suspicion, I will be very candid. I think there was just suspicion of CWRM’s intention so I said okay, we’ll do it incrementally.",0,B3,02/20/2024
I’ll give up my shirt.,0,B3,02/20/2024
"I’m hoping with better coordination with the county water departments, I suspect we will never change LURF’s mind, but the county water departments, I think we are trying to be much more collaborative with them and talk about these, in particular legislation, ahead of time and I should have spoken to them earlier. I’m hoping that this one will proceed forward.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"If I could just add to this. I’m not too sure if you recall at the same time as Red Hill there was a WAI, Water Alliance Initiative. It was a coordinated effort between state and county agencies and governments with respect to the remediation of the Red Hill, not to circumvent or in any way to intervene with existing regulatory processes, either by DOH or EPA, but more to supplement. The WAI report asks for more than what DOH could do. It includes research but it also looked at an ecosystem approach to remediation and so I think the determination was that DLNR (Department of Land and Natural Resources) was in the better position to oversee the coordination of this effort to implement the WAI initiative. That’s why it’s being placed in DLNR with some capacity.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"If I can just add to this one. I was trying not to take this personal but I thought this might have been the anti-Chair Chang Bill, but nonetheless that was my caution to the legislators is not to change the organizational structure of CWRM in response to an incident but make sure that it is done in a very thoughtful way. Let me share from my perspective, I see CWRM as an integral part of DLNR. I’m really looking at how do I manage mauka to makai, how do I look at ecosystem water resources, how do I look at ecosystem management. CWRM is an integral component of those discussions internally with other DLNR divisions, separate and apart from the regulator, and the expertise that they bring. To take them out of DLNR and to truly make them a totally independent agency would in my mind...we miss the opportunity to do true indigenous resource management. That’s why we have comments, we have opposition, and we have support for various components of this measure, but it is moving through the legislature so if any of you have got any comments, I’d welcome that, but otherwise that was some of the thought process that went into our testimony.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"I wouldn’t support that bill. I think it has too many changes and it’s basically a reaction to what controversy was when some of us opposed, but I won’t comment on all of it. One of the things is that to make a chairperson from one of the appointed areas, you and I know that chairperson is not just a figurehead position. It takes a lot of energy and I don’t see how any one of us would have the energy or the commitment to be the chairperson and be that involved. For that reason alone, I would oppose it. As far as the conflicts of interest, I think the current laws are adequate. We don’t need that, but anyway, for what it’s worth, I wouldn’t support this.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"Don’t worry, they put those takes effect on those dates just to keep the bill alive, but if it moves forward that’s just a placeholder. They’ll change it should the bill move forward.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"I think that was Land Division, they were much more concerned. They thought that was going to be transferred to Land Division. I said I don’t think that’s the intention. I think the intention is possibly to transfer these over to the county water departments. We have amended our testimony to provide more comments because I think we do support the counties having management over the water infrastructure.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"If that goes through, the part about the executive director, how is the executive director appointed?",0,B3,02/20/2024
They would have to be approved by the Commission.,0,B3,02/20/2024
"Right now, Dawn would pick someone and then we would approve. I think some of the executive offices like Office of AG (Attorney General) is the Governor that reports.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"I don’t know. Chair may have some based on the KIRC, Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve Commission. I think it would be similar in nature to that.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"I think the way that that’s done is the Commission actually they do their own solicitation and they hire so it’s not even someone from either the Governor or the Chairperson, the Commission on its own. A truly administrative attached agency like KIRC and like Mauna Kea Authority, they are totally independent. They have their own office, they have their own staff but they select their own executive director.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"They still rely on the personnel services, fiscal services of the Department.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"At DLNR, we provide HR and fiscal support but they are truly independent. CWRM is a little on the hybrid side. They’re not truly independently attached. I’d like to say the best of both worlds, some say the worst of both worlds. I don’t know, depends upon which way you sit, but there would be a distinction in the administration if they are truly administratively attached like KIRC and Mauna Kea.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"I would have preferred keeping the way it is but clarifying that if we approve hiring, we also approve firing.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"Fair enough. I don’t have an objection to having the first deputy be an executive director that’s not politically appointed that could be appointed by the Commission. It’s essentially an exempt position, but they’re not subject to change of administration.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"Then the other part would have been like in the past that we would be able to get independent counsel but only under certain circumstances when there’s clearly a conflict. Right now, the Attorney General can say no and that’s the end of it, even though from my standpoint there was a clear conflict like the original Waiāhole case. I think the court was pretty spot on with saying if there’s a conflict then you should have [inaudible]. But if there’s a conflict but there was no way around it, for example when Michael was in your position, DLNR was a party in it and then he was also the Chair over it. In a situation like that he can stay on because there’s no resolution in other words. I would have preferred it that.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"There are some agencies that they do have authority to hire their own attorney and I think that the way that this provision is drafted, the AGs did oppose that. There are certain circumstances where there is a clear conflict of interest.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"I believe just to address your concern, this bill authorizes the Commission to annually evaluate the executive director’s work, so basically can hire and fire them.",0,B3,02/20/2024
What are the chances of these bill’s going through?,0,B3,02/20/2024
"It’s moving notwithstanding. My sentiment is if you’re going to reorganize CWRM, make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons not in response to an incident because I will share with you, there’s tremendous value having CWRM part of the Department. I bring them into meetings that we have like on this Maui temp housing. They wouldn’t come into those meetings, they’d have to wait till there’s a regulatory process, a permit that comes to them. But in situations where we’re looking at watershed management and impacts on nearshore waters, CWRM participates in those discussions. I find them to be an integral part of the overall. If we’re looking at a truly ecosystem-based management, an ahupuaʻa-based management, they need to be at the table during the planning process not at the purely regulatory process. I see CWRM as being more proactive in that role, but if they become a regulator and administratively attached, that opportunity wouldn’t be available to us as it is now. That’s my manaʻo on that one.",0,B3,02/20/2024
It creates this Red Hill remediation special fund. The intention is that the State is going to Congress and we have spoken to our Congressional delegates about providing additional funds specifically for Red Hill remediation and those funds would be placed into this special fund to be managed to implement the WAI initiatives.,0,B3,02/20/2024
"I just wanted to quickly address the comment about House Bill 2703 which is also relevant to Senate Bill 3327. I don’t think either bill is an anti-Dawn Chang bill, it’s about giving the Water Commission independence and it finally implements the 30-year-old review Commission recommendations. As I’m sure this Commission is aware a lot of these bills seek to implement recommendations of a Review Commission report issued in 1994 in the same initiative that created the Water Code. A Review Commission was established to perform a comprehensive review of the State Water Code five years after its enactment and a seven-member commission held multiple public information meetings, public hearings throughout the state and 30 years ago it issued a 200 plus page report with recommendations for improving the Water Code. Fast forward 30 years, for people working on water issues for generations, it’s heartening to see that finally there’s a potential for these Review Commission recommendations to come to fruition with the goal being to allow the Commission to act proactively and be free from political influence. I think that’s the driving force behind these proposals and so I just wanted to comment on that. Also, to comment on the statement Dean had made I think it was about SB 3327 and the ability to retain independent legal counsel. The comment about the AGs providing sound and timely advice to the Commission, we did review the testimony that was submitted on that bill and the irony of the Department of the Attorney Generals taking the position that this Commission shouldn’t be able to retain and consult independent legal counsel is remarkable, especially considering historically and recently the AGs have been wrong on the law. Respectfully, if you look at the AG’s track record on appeal in this area, they’ve lost every case and this has caused a multitude of problems for the Commission. The fact that the Commission is getting bad advice is part of the problem. The AG’s testimony on this bill also is case in point for why the Commission’s ability to consult independent legal counsel is so important. That testimony made multiple misstatements of law including that commercial ag was a public trust purpose that was squarely addressed by the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court in the Waiāhole Case and wrote the exact opposite of what the AG is claiming. I think that it’s important for this Commission to be able to consult independent legal counsel in situations and that bill also just gives the Commission the flexibility to do that when necessary. That’s all I wanted to comment on this briefing. Thank you.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"Wayne Tanaka of Sierra Club of Hawaiʻi. I just want to say this is awesome. I really think getting briefings like this is something that more boards and commissions should be doing especially since you’re essentially relying on the administration to advocate on bills that could impact your ability to fulfill your kuleana. I’m also glad to see that we are aligned on many measures including the penalties bill. I did want to note for that bill HB 1544, the stated justification last was that increased penalties would somehow result in the max penalty being automatically levied on county departments of water supply and then that would impact housing security. To be frank that was just ridiculous and non-credible fear mongering. The Commission has almost never pursued penalties except against egregious violations and the express language of the bill requires the Commission to consider a whole range of factors in fine amounts. The fear mongering from LURF that the Governor unfortunately listened to was not grounded in legal and political reality. And just for perspective, right now with your $5,000 a day maximum penalty a violation involving just five MGD (million gallons per day) would be subject to a max fine of 1/10th of one cent per gallon. Obviously this needs to change if there are bad actors that are recalcitrant and don’t want to stop violating the Water Code. We are looking forward to supporting the Water Commission as you advocate in support of this bill and there’s a lot of community support for this measure as well. I did want to add a couple things about HB 2703 and SB 3327 which is the bill that Elena from Earthjustice just talked about. It would basically democratize the Water Commission’s leadership and sets some employment protections for staff and it’s absolutely not personal to Chair Chang. It really has been a long time coming for 30 years from before Waiāhole. It’s been a long-standing recommendation and it would help protect the Commission and its staff from both the perception of political influence as well as awkwardness of balancing public trust mandates with other less substantive considerations. The public trust needs to be independently and objectively upheld and the Commission would be able to speak clearly and act objectively with some of the insulation that these measures would provide including at the legislature and without having to worry about certain special interests with political influence such as LURF without exposing the Governor and his administration to political liability. Just want to express my gratitude to Chair for agendizing this item and I’m happy to answer any other questions that the Commission may have. Thank you.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"Aloha, I’d just like to underscore one point that the Sierra Club just made with respect to the penalties bill. I think a lot of the focus has been around the departments of water supply because they along with LURF led to the bill being killed last year, but I do want to uplift what the Sierra Club mentioned. This bill is very important to a lot of communities, especially in Maui Komohana for example, where we have had repeated violations of the interim instream flow standards and where even the Commission’s own staff has struggled with diverters to try and have the law fulfilled. The ability for the Commission to be able to implement maximum penalties doesn’t necessarily mean that it will and as we all know I’ve been appearing before the Commission for more than 20 years now, we’ve seen huge fines in only a small handful of cases and I trust the staff in the Commission to be able to work with that. Mahalo to Chair Chang for negotiating that agreement with the departments. I would note that the initial $60,000 recommendation would make this the same as DOH. $25,000 is much better than $5,000, but I also think there’s no harm in standing by the $60,000. Mahalo for this briefing and for the work that your staff has been doing on the Commission. It’s been heavy at the legislature, it’s been a big lift.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"I have a question as somebody who doesn’t, but probably should track legislation more carefully. Both House Bill 2703 and SB 3327, do they say that the DLNR chair cannot chair or just that other officials can?",0,B3,02/20/2024
"Specifically says is ineligible to serve as a chairperson. So DLNR Chair and DOH Chair, we only serve as ex-officio.",0,B3,02/20/2024
I’m just going to admit my ignorance in public here. You submit in support or opposition but what is the ability for the Commission to weigh on revisions or direct that?,0,B3,02/20/2024
"You are always free to provide your own testimony as an individual. That was part of the briefing is one, to provide you an update of the legislation. There’s a lot of legislation but so that because some of these things are relevant to some of the issues we discussed previously regarding Maui. It’s also to get an inclination because we do represent the Commission as well. I didn’t want to, in particular SB 3327 and House Bill 2703, the whole reorganization of CWRM. For me it’s important, I am just but one Commissioner so I am interested to hear if any of the other Commissioners have any thoughts about this. Then it can fashion our collective testimony as well.",0,B3,02/20/2024
There’s a lot packed into it. And also understanding how the companion bills may move.,0,B3,02/20/2024
"They’re not totally companion, but they have similar provisions.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"What I appreciate is this briefing at this point in the year because I think in the past it’s been afterwards and it’s like, oh maybe we could have weighed in or said something.",0,B3,02/20/2024
We should be able to find the testimony that staff submitted.,0,B3,02/20/2024
Status and you can also sign up to be notified when a hearing is coming up.,0,B3,02/20/2024
You can always ask us but if you go on the legislative website and you put in these bills you can find it.,0,B3,02/20/2024
"This is a really, I think, a helpful rundown and also understanding of the rationale.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"There’s a little more breathing room. Michael Yoshinaga who used to be part of the Commission staff, retired at the end of last year and divisions have been tasked to take on their own review of all the bills. That was a huge lift and thank you to Alexa, especially, for helping to review that and Neal and Nicholas on his team and Ryan Imata for reviewing the bills. Initially we were tracking 150 bills, fortunately we didn’t have to testify on all of them but at least monitoring many of them. We’re still monitoring a bunch but primarily testifying on these that you see before you.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"As well as processing permits. A lot of this, from what I understand, is motivated by that 1994 report. I guess some things are still problematic and some things may not be anymore and I would wonder about staff’s take on that ‘94 report. Just weighing in on that.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"I mean we certainly would be happy to send it out to you folks to take a look at. Personally, I haven’t had a chance to review it yet, it’s on my list of things to do.",0,B3,02/20/2024
When did you start at the Commission? I’m just wondering. Before that?,0,B3,02/20/2024
"It would be interesting to see, as this is your job, to see how much of that could make sense.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"There have been several reviews. I think there was one ‘78 prior to the Code. That one was already envisioning water shortage issues occurring on Oʻahu and Maui. That was one that Alexa had found. There was a ‘94 one and one other one, I thought.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"1985, that was the Advisory Commission report to draft the Water Code, but that was the drafting of the water code itself.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"In reviewing the bills, she went back and found these documents and took a look at them. We can forward them out to you folks.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"In mind there’s been a lot of court decisions that have really provided us those additional guidance on public trust principles. The whole implementation of Ka Paʻakai, so in my mind a lot of the issues that were raised in that report have been addressed. Some of them may not have been but I think that time has changed. Alexa’s also going through a rule amendment review because we haven’t amended the Water Code since its original adoption and that’s 1987.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"The rules haven’t been amended, the Code has.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"Right. She’s really putting a lot of effort into that. There’s a lot on CWRM’s plate, they’re trying to juggle a lot of things but I think having guidance from the Commission and for me, that’s what’s important. I’m only but one Commissioner so whether it’s Maui temp housing or whether it’s bills, I think it’s important to provide the Water Commission an opportunity to weigh on some of these. These are policies. In my mind, the Commission drives policy, staff implements our policies so some of these legislation, it is a change to policy. I think it is important if you have thoughts about that, let us know. They are important.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"I would appreciate it if the staff, when these bills come up, let us know about it because we might want to testify as an individual. I certainly would have wanted to do that at some point.",0,B3,02/20/2024
"May I ask that you sign up on the website for email notice? Only because we’re tracking a lot of bills. If you tell us which one specifically, we might be able to let but oftentimes we’ll get 48-hours’ notice to submit testimony. Testimony has to be within 24 hours.",0,B3,02/20/2024
Usually that’s the case really short terms.,0,B3,02/20/2024

"You’re right, there is an expectation and it’s very difficult both to physically be present as well as maintain the operation. We have a new First Deputy Ryan Kanakaʻole. Ryan is a former AG. Ryan’s task is primarily legislation so that’s been very helpful in reviewing leg(islature). The fact that we’ve changed now, all of the divisions are required to review all of the bills. It’s really given everybody this holistic approach to how even bills that were not necessarily admin bills because CWRM has no admin bills but as you can see there are a lot of bills that affect them. This has been a full court press with each of the divisions to dedicate the time and the resources to one, stay up with legislation. Also, our budget, as well as responding to legislators but at the same time they have to keep the daily operations of their division moving forward. It’s a lot. I appreciate this staff, CWRM has got unbelievable staff. The professionalism, the work, their work ethics, the values that they bring, I’ve really appreciated CWRM staff.",0,B3,02/20/2024
Maui Island Water Use and Development Plan Update,0,B1,03/21/2023
"Mr. Jeremy Kimura of CWRM Planning Branch, Eva Blumenstein (Maui DWS Planning Office), and Honorable Councilman Shane Sinenci provided the update.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"Mr. Jeremy Kimura, CWRM Planning Branch Mr. Kimura gave a presentation on a proposed approach for adoption of the Maui Island Water Use and Development Plan Update and some of the issues that were raised through the public hearing process. He also talked about the staff’s analysis of the document and their recommendations as well as next steps. The Hawaii Water Plan is required in the State Water Code to plan for the State’s water future and is made up of several documents as a management toolbox. Links to the presentation and relevant documents were provided for those watching remotely.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"Maui Councilman Shane Sinenci Shane Sinenci, Maui County council member and the former Chair of the Agriculture and Public Trust Committee which reviewed and approved the Water Development Plan before you today. The Department of Water supply spent considerable time creating this plan. I wanted to focus on the review process and the community work that went into this plan and put forth considerable time and effort to review and add to the plan over the last seven years which played an important role in shaping it into the document that you’re reviewing today. During my term as Chair, I held 15 Ag and Public Trust committee meetings on the plan. In previous years several other committees also worked on the plan including the water and infrastructure committee, the water infrastructure and transportation committee, and the environmental agriculture and cultural preservation committees. In my committee, council members went through each chapter of the document in each aquifer sector area as part of our review, and we added 49 new strategies and expanded five existing policies. We incorporated the addendum section throughout the corresponding areas of the document and into the document’s main body. We added information on Native Hawaiian water and cultural rights including information on the public trust doctrine, riparian rights, kuleana rights, konohiki rights and the duties of state agencies to protect Native Hawaiian traditional and customary rights which were included in the Ka Pa‘akai analysis sections. We wrote a new section entitled historical and cultural context of the regulatory system according to input from the ‘Aha Moku councils. We also added the consent decree and the Board of water supply temporary investigative report regarding the feasibility of purchasing and maintaining the EMI water delivery system to the appendices. I’m particularly proud of our work with the local Maui Island Aha Moku councils to ensure that water as a cultural resource is properly considered and addressed. My staff and I met with the local councils to integrate Native Hawaiian water resource management history, strategies, and generational knowledge into the plan. I want to note, that their input doesn’t mean that they support the plan. They remain neutral and that not all their recommended strategies were adopted by the Council, specifically the West Maui council asked for strategy of prohibiting water system connectivity to the Council. The Council did not adopt that. The ‘Aha Moku council in the Ko‘olau area also did not support the Haʻikū well strategy however, most of local council’s recommendations were adopted in part one of the plan. We added a section on kānāwai, a history of Hawaiian water law and for each area the council’s stress ecosystem management and returning water to the system as a result, strategies were adopted so requiring the county to advocate for stream connectivity and kalo cultivation, kuleana, and traditional rights, a strategy requiring the Department of Water Supply to use generational and traditional knowledge to compliment scientific data strategies were adopted directing the Department of Water Supply and county council to consult with local Native Hawaiians when making decisions. The plan now requires that a Native Hawaiian advisory group be established, and that the Department of Water Supply employees receive training on Hawaiian Resource Management and Hawaiian rights. The island Aha Moku councils and the general communities also cited a lack of enforcement by CWRM on stream IIFS and they hope you can work more with local volunteers for stream monitoring. Both the council and the general community ask for strategies to limit extravagant hotel water use and penalize water waste behaviors. We added strategies including policies directing the council to establish a new tiered rate structure and a separate hotel category that promotes water conservation. They ask that we add environmental protection strategies for dry land native forests. Wetland areas, aquifer recharge areas, groundwater, and policies directing the council to revise county laws to promote water catchment, water use efficient, landscaping and building requirements and water conservation for golf courses, resorts, and public facilities. Local area councils made some area specific comments for the Ko‘olau district. A strategy encourages home rule of Water Resources specifically the EMI system which was adopted for Hāna strategy establishing additional water priorities for kuleana users, cultural uses and affordable housing was adopted for Haʻikū members did not support the Haʻikū well strategy but that input did not result in any new strategies. In West Maui there was the request to adopt a strategy not to interconnect water systems across the different areas, but the committee members did not adopt that. So, while there are still community members who feel that areas need to be worked on, I see the plan as a living document. The plan is required to be updated regularly to reflect our ever-changing environment persistent with drought conditions, water scarcity, and new legislation also new state requirements including stream flow standards and inclusion of the newly created East Maui Water Authority board. Our community went over the plan and testified at each of the community meetings. There are concerns specifically about climate change and the need for the county to adopt more stringent water conservation goals. The current goal is eight percent over the next 20 years, and I know should strive for more. The plans also need to include updated data as Mr. Kimura had mentioned in the update. I would like to see data presented in an easier to understand in layman’s terms in ways that the public can easily understand. The Department of Water Supply may also want to hire a consultant for the update to make the plan easier for the public to use and I understand that other islands have also done this. There is also a need for the update to include information on the Water Authority ballot initiative that passed during our last election. We are in the process of creating the East Maui Community Water Authority board and it is our hope that having the county in control of Public Water Resources we can provide more resources to help satisfy the up-country water meter list applications. And finally, the Haʻikū community strongly spoke up against the Haʻikū aquifer as the main source of new county wells and they felt that this strategy is unfair because their needs have not been met. There was discussion in the committee about removing the Haʻikū well strategy, but not enough support was received to remove it and the major reason was that removing the Haʻikū well strategy as a source of water would have created an imbalance in the plan’s demand causing the plan to become invalid. The new water director stated yesterday that a consultant has been hired to complete a feasibility study as mandated by the court consent decree and so in closing I would just like to leave the commission members with an understanding of all the work that was put into this document it is a living document much like the importance of ka wai ola. The work doesn’t end today.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"Ms. Eva Blumenstein – Maui Dept of Water Supply Just want to mahalo Councilmember Sinenci and the community and the commission staff that has spent so much time working diligently with the Department and private water conveyers. A lot of work went into this plan. We had an original plan submitted in 2010 to the commission that was rejected, it was not adequately addressing all the private purveyors, it wasn’t based on hydrologic units and we feel that the plan really now addressing these controversial issues that have been unsolved for 30 plus years. It doesn’t come up with a solution, but it really tackles it. We knew starting this reigniting the public outreach and doing this effort back in 2016 that there would be tradeoffs and some difficult compromises. After 70 plus meetings, we feel that the plan now meets the needs of the land use plans. It has support from the broader community. It’s not going to be everything to everyone but it’s a good tool. We’ve been able to use it already on the county level to guide our Capital Improvement program and investing in water resource protection so regardless the Commissions purposes we believe it meets the state water code and beyond even the framework so far, we are grateful for all the work that went into this and that we’ve been able to apply this as a guide for the county level.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"asked Jeremy Kimura, how does the plan address that the majority of the water delivery system on Maui is controlled by private entities?",0,B1,03/21/2023
"answered, it’s definitely one of the main challenges specifically for Maui because we have multiple private purveyors that are sometimes competing for the same resource, and we had to be really diligent developing this plan to make sure this is not the Department’s plan. This is not our CIP program but looking at all the needs of other purveyors and there’s only so many tools that can be used to implement strategies that address the private water purveyors because obviously the county doesn’t have jurisdiction of allocations to that extent. Some of the strategies, I can give you a couple of examples-call for more investment in water resource protection in watershed management based on the type of end uses if you are private purveyor using groundwater from a specific watershed. We should see better investments, matching investments for the water resource that you extract. If their strategies for optimizing alternative resources before using conventional groundwater or surface water, we want the planning department and the bodies that will approve land use entitlements to include that strategy as a condition of entitling a land use or approving a land use permit. We’ve been working closely with Maui Planning Department to set that up so in areas that are not designated, there’s all these different tools but it’s always a challenge whether that is for conservation. I mean large municipalities are better equipped to have well-funded conservation programs or source protection programs and private purveyors benefit from that but other strategies such as regulating conservation measures in the future where proposing conservation bills could apply to all water purveyors and doesn’t have to be for only county owned systems, just a couple of examples. Dr. Kagawa- Viviani: Thanked Jeremy, Councilmember Sinenci and Eva for that overview. I guess I’m thinking mostly about that first complaint about that existing plan and I, myself, found it really difficult to navigate a 1360-page document that didn’t have a clickable table of contents. I was wondering that because Maui is at this inflection point and as you emphasize community engagement is key,you know the document itself doesn’t invite participation, it doesn’t invite access. And parts of the document may have been overlooked because it is hard to find. Are there or can you develop a more accessible format of this document without having to go thru all the council approval just to make it more accessible and to allow for people to focus on the sections in the document that relate to them or search it? Because, even the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report which is a totally an unwieldy beast has broken things down in a way to make it more accessible. Is that possible? I can see some easy things, but I don’t know if that’s for Jeremy or for Eva or Councilmember Sinenci? Is there a way to keep the content there but make it more accessible without having to go through council processes?",0,B1,03/21/2023
"I’ll just mention from the commission side that I totally agree with you on making all these documents much more accessible. I think it’s a big issue too in terms of transparency making things more accessible for everyone to read goes a long way towards transparency in terms of government. The Commission, we are committed to working with the department on creating a summary document that would be easy for people to look at, so I’ll leave it to Eva I’m not sure in terms of times and resources they’re willing to expand on it but we are happy to work on that with the County.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"This is something we heard not until the draft plan was submitted to the board and board hearings. As the plan went through County Council, it grew and grew, it started at a fairly large quantity, and it grew another couple hundred pages so it’s an unwieldy document and the original format was never set up for easy access for the public. So, at this point and time when it’s been passed as coordinates, I agree with Jeremy. We would like to have something that’s more of a brief summary for general consumption and that document can be updated more quickly. A matrix showing sort of an implementation matrix of what kind of quantitative and qualitive criteria we should look at over the implementation of this plan because obviously there’s all these different strategies that translate into projects to be scoped out where’s there’s more opportunities for community input whatever that is. You know environmental assessments, well construction, permits conservation bills, etc. so that sort of like a smaller user friendly public use document we would like to have that would just be quicker update because we know there’s not realistic update of what your surround plan in five years has done that so as long as this is the format of the framework and the state water code it’s going to take this long you’re going to have some outdated information in the plan but we would definitely like to have a brief summary document to have for more immediate use for the public.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"I wanted to clarify that a summary document would be great but even just the table of contents. isn’t hyperlinked to sections, so you have to scroll down. That doesn’t even require any substance. Is that something that could be done expediently and just as a step. And as for the updatethe idea that this is a living document, that there will be version b or 2.0 in five years? Because people are going to refer to the plan, if it’s a moving piece how are you going to control versioning?",0,B1,03/21/2023
I mentioned the implementation matrix similar to the community and the land use plans. You don’t update version ABC until you actually update the whole plan. The policies are intended to be long term and what use demand changes more quickly than that so implementation matrix will be the tool to follow lead agencies funding other projects and what not. But that could also have more of a summary that’s easier used and applied by the public that would follow maybe be attached to capital improvement program proposals or whatever the projects that we’re scoping out.,0,B1,03/21/2023
"Quick question: What page is the implementation matrix? On a word search, I could not find anything matching implementation matrix.",0,B1,03/21/2023
{long pause} Okay this is a sign right here about it . This speaks well to the point that was just made.,0,B1,03/21/2023
"Thank you Jeremy just to help me put things into context other key elements providing input to the county plan or state plans. How current are these plans? Like the water quality plan, the resource protection plans the ag water plan or does the county need to sort of update that on their own? How does the integration of that database work as the counties go through their water development plan?",0,B1,03/21/2023
"Good question. They’re all sort of moving targets in a way so I’ll just say the water resource protection plan which we’ve done was updated last in 2019 and the water quality plan as well. Joanna can confirm this with 2019 as well which water resource plan is the big one since it has the sustainable yield numbers. That’s what the counties need to use to plan for the development as well as policies on instream flow standard setting and things like that. The ag water use development plan has been a difficult one in a sense that there’s been several updates. I think you might have been here when the Department of Ag did their last update to us and there was a lot of pushback on this recent update to the plan so it’s sort of in development right now where we’ve sent them comments on how they can improve it and put more information in but the latest version of that plan is really from 2012. I believe the only numbers that are being used by the water plan preparers right now is that estimation of ag zone lands or ag entitlements. The water duty could be right for these places. The state water projects plan recently just completed I believe in 2020 was the last statewide update for state projects across the state and previous to that in 2019 we had for Department of Hawaiian Home Lands an update was done so those projections went into the different plans. One of the big things that came out of the state water projects plan update was we got an idea of what the reservation should be for DHHL that’s what we’re using to set the reservations for the State. They’re all sorts of moving targets. The big one is the ag water use and development plan needs to be updated and we are working with the Department of Ag as you know they have new leadership now, so we are trying to work with that team to make sure that plan gets updated because we see it as a critical component for water planning.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"Jeremy, on this issue of ag water. Just clarify my memory if you will. Haven’t we been using 2500 gallons per acre per day in most of our agricultural allocations?",0,B1,03/21/2023
maybe Kaleo can speak to that but the planning number that has been adopted is 3400 gallons per acre. People may ask for less I think because that’s kind of an old number that was developed kind of a while ago. I believe staff is using things like our irrigation estimation model to get a better idea of what demand is for the specific geographic area I think that’s resulted in lower per capita recommendations from staff.,0,B1,03/21/2023
"2500 gallons per day comes from the Waiāhole Water Case and it’s been kind of what we’ve used as a conservative number. But in the Ag Water Use Development Plan it is closer to what Jeremy said and what we are also using is IWRREDS which is a tool we partnered with Ulupono to develop and to estimate actual site-specific agricultural irrigation demands based on type of irrigation, evapotranspiration, all of that and soil moisture is all factored into it so it gets us more parcel specific estimates. All of those are presented to the Commission in its decision making. Ultimately the commission has kind of leaned more towards the conservative number of 2500 gallons per acre per day in order to encourage conservation. As Jeremy has talked about, we are looking at ranges and not necessarily definitive points for a number and if it can be justified through water reporting and data, we try to make it as real as possible.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"When we encourage or induce our people, we have the wisdom to invest in infrastructure that allow them to have water storage. Are they then able to supplement and meet any gaps that they have in irrigation need by way of our allocation of 2500 plus a supplemental infusion of water coming from their own storage systems?",0,B1,03/21/2023
That’s a great strategy and something we’d love to actually test and get proof on and data to support but unfortunately a lot of our agricultural users or systems in general aren’t collecting that data and aren’t doing that type of analysis. We need to push all water purveyors whether it’s potable or non-potable to really start to look at how we can be better stewards of those resources and collect the data because I don’t have a definitive answer for you that that strategy is actually working.,0,B1,03/21/2023
"Look forward to that continuing discussion. Second question: Councilman, thank you for that report I really appreciate the way you responded to the questions and the issues that were raised by the public by saying okay if you say our data is old or you say there’s gaps, here’s what we did, here’s what we included and I really appreciate that approach to it and then invite what we missed and seems like people said you missed this you then went and backfilled that information into your plan in which I think is an excellent approach. My question for you is on the issue of incentivizing or inducing conservation. We live in an era of excesses when people can actually afford to be excessive and are undaunted by a fine or a tiered rate schedule to be excessive, are you finding that having that strategy of having higher rates really works to induce conservation in certain aquifers or might we have to put the very permit at risk or have the power to make our own reductions if they don’t comply. What’s working?",0,B1,03/21/2023
"Great question and I think the tiered structure was one of the first efforts to address those very large users. Some of the hotels that still had those huge water uses during a pandemic when they were closed so I think that was the first step. But you’re right, part of the strategies we had to do it in conjunction with other things. For instance, the water director talked about expanding our R1 uses. If we are going to use so much water, we need to expand our R1 uses in those areas where there’s high water use so that we can use recycled water in some of those areas. The tiered work but also pun intended multi-tiered approach to doing other things in conjunction with those conservation efforts. The higher water taxes was just to kind of deter and encourage conservation but you’re right there’s other things that we still need to also do. Some of the things where if there’s a lot of pool usage, we should be covering pools for evaporation so that they are not being evaporated in the dry areas so those are some of the discussions that came out throughout our two-year process.",0,B1,03/21/2023
I think throughout our government we are looking at the issue of fines and for some people those fines are meaningless so if fines are meant to induce conformance and compliance it doesn’t work.,0,B1,03/21/2023
"It’s normally upcountry that has the water restrictions, so we are hoping to expand water use whether it be thru the East Maui Water Authority to increase water from there or other sources so that we’re not putting certain parts of the County on water restrictions while others enjoy more water use.",0,B1,03/21/2023
Chair the last question is for you. My zoom screen is showing that perhaps Lucienne Danaie and Keaaumoku Kapu is interested in testifying on this matter is that correct?,0,B1,03/21/2023
"Thank you I just want to confirm that this plan is really a framework. It’s to guide future decisions. It in and of itself is not an authorization or decision. I do appreciate the County’s responsiveness to the questions and Shane in particular. Mahalo for your effort and community engagement. That’s really where I come from, I’m kind of a process person. It’s important that people feel like they’ve been heard and listened to and you apparently did a lot of that. You heard the concerns, made appropriate adjustments especially with respect to native Hawaiian rights and issues, so again mahalo for taking the pause not rushing to get the plan approved but really taking the time to engage the community in ways that are meaningful to them so that this document is much more reflective of their concerns and approaches.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"Just a comment, this commission is not a stranger to controversial issues on Maui with water and seeing all the comments it sure would be great in April to have some sort of smaller executive summary or something. You guys have worked so hard on this to be able to have a 1300-page document that nobody can access is not really reflective of the work you’ve put in so, I’m really hoping that in April there is some sort of summary to make it a little more easy to read I think that would benefit all the future water issues on Maui.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"I did have one more follow up it’s actually directed to our ex-officio DOHrepresentative and the presenters. I’m thinking about O‘ahu and Maui’s trajectory of urbanization and our current water issues that I’m becoming more and more aware of. I’m teaching water and society this semester and get lots of questions from the students. We’ve covered recycled water and emerging contaminants so in the case of Maui we do want to use recycled water but how worried should we be about these emerging organic contaminants and pharmaceuticals that are in our wastewater streams as well as nitrates? Because it’s not just about water amounts and allocations. As we’re using more water, you’re creating more wastewater to have to then spend energy cleaning. So, if you have thoughts about that and how to think about it in context.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"The department is supportive of reuse in the state and is working very closely with the county of Maui on their reuse program and procedures and the future of it. So, there is a review of the treatment train which is used for the reuse water and the importance of the treatment of the emerging contaminants as well as those contaminants that we are aware of. There is research that is being done. We are aware and keeping track of it and we have staff from the department that is attending reuse conferences and symposiums and they are trying to keep up with all the changing improvements to the processes so that we can bring them here back to Hawai‘i.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"I’m testifying on behalf of the Haʻikū Community Association. We certainly mahalo all the efforts that were made on this plan. We were not consulted about the complete strategy of East Maui wells. We were invited to some vague meetings that were talking about an East Maui groundwater strategy. This is not the way to engage the public. If all the water or majority of water for the Central Maui area is to come from Haʻikū, no one in Haʻikū is able to get a water meter for 20 years. I want people to understand that then you have a meeting in Haʻikū and you announce what your plan is in Haʻikū so that you can figure out the solution that fits for everyone. I’ve heard the presentations today this is a framework this or that please keep in mind every environmental impact document will cite this plan and will not cite the policies it will site the numbers in the charts it will say you know the chart says there’s two million gallons a day available for hotel growth in West Maui is that going to be a real fact after we look at what the real water situation of West Maui is? Is that going to be a fact of life? If not, it shouldn’t be in this plan or there should be a footnote that says this may be adjusted greatly and should be reflected in any documents. Every environmental document is going to say there’s eight million gallons a day available for the central system because they’re going to drill wells in Haʻikū. Do we know if those wells in Haʻikū are going to produce that amount? We do not. And the previous draft of a plan which this commission rejected from 2010 stated that there were great uncertainties about the Haʻikū strategy and about several other strategies. It was honest. This plan is not honest. I can’t go into the details, I only have 3 minutes. I guess the only way to explain these details is to ask for a contested case and have time to really explain. This is not about conservation measures like turning off the water when you brush your teeth, this is looking at South Maui where 11 million gallons a day of potable treated County water is used and 5 million ends up at the sewage treatment plant the other 6 million is probably used for irrigation. Is that a sound strategy when we are facing climate change? This document has the mealy mouth. It doesn’t say we need a strategy to make this different now the folks in South Maui are talking about this they’re updating their community plan right now and they’re suggesting two million gallons being used to water in Wailea. Can we not use that water and instead use R1 water to irrigate these deserts into oasis. Our plan just leaves out this important information in spite of everybody’s attempts and it should be readable. Our former plan was readable. In fact, the 1990 draft was not accepted by this commission. That’s a fact that’s kind of buried a new 1992 version that was done by a consultant, not done in house. I can’t even start to explain how off this data is, framework or not, everyone is going to be looking at the data when your data says that A and B is going to be needing 4000 to5000 thousand gallons per day per acre or Maui Mahipono and their actual reports that are available online show that they’re using under 2 thousand million gallons a day over the 5,000 acres they’ve planted. Something’s wrong. We don’t have the right data here and we can’t have a good plan. In fact, this plan is not going to be updated in five years, it may be another 20 years because it’s structured so poorly. The structure needs to be redone and it needs to be made updatable. I commend the efforts that Councilmember Sinenci made. He was honest with you. Many of the things that were asked for by the kanaka community were completely ignored despite his best efforts simply because people don’t want to face the inconvenient truth that we have less water. We can’t have the same farming strategies. We can’t have 23 percent loss with our ditch systems. We can’t have 60 percent water system. I think there will need to be a contested case to really explain what is not right with this plan and why you should not accept it so thank you Commissioners for listening.",0,B1,03/21/2023
"Aloha Chair Chang and Commission. Mahalo for this opportunity for me to testify. Mahalo to the CWRM staff, Jeremy Kimura, for his synopsis on all the data details provided and also the hearing for our community concerns was great to share this around coming from your third staff and mahalo to council Shane Sinenci for having dialogue with our Moku Island counselors and implementing Native Hawaiian and kuleana cultural traditional rights and sharing the importance of seeking traditional generational knowledge. Why that is important is because we’re losing a lot of our ground rooted kupuna in our community. It’s really important we seek the mana‘o from them now to try and see how we can incorporate those values with water use development plan. We in Maui like how this is going. We finally feel we have a great opportunity of being a part of a greater result and hoping that now that Komohana which is the West side of Maui is finally being designated gives us a greater opportunity to being a part of having a primary result and bringing more honest  recommendations. I hope that in the future we will always be a part of the recommendation provided for the Maui water use development plan. Komohana is different in many ways. The West side of Maui has been bombarded by private interests and the municipalities between the county as well as the private sector. It’s good to see that the state has designated a referee to bring our major concerns to the forefront and when we didn’t support the plan it was generally for the whole of Maui not just Komohana. But also Hikina in the East side of Kihei that the plan was really lacking a lot of grassroots information’s on how the community concerns can be met. But I mahalo all of you for your due diligence. I know that this is not an action item. I just wanted to mahalo the route this is going. It’s great for the Komohana community knowing that hopefully on the East side when they start the water authority, they’ll be some kind of value in it. We can actually look at things and help incorporate on Komohana’s side on the West side of Maui.

The recommendation includes implementing measures to minimize the impact on the environment, seeking concurrence from SHPD for abandonment of diversion, and following the U.S. fish and wildlife service recommendations. He also mentions an amendment to the submittal to declare the project exempt from EA requirements.",1,B3,04/18/2023

"Chapter 343 of HEPA requires an environmental assessment for actions that may cause significant environmental impacts, triggered in part by presence on conservation lands. Leaving the refuse in the conservation lands may cause environmental impacts and raises a question of whether the project would be exempt from Chapter 343. Cutting up the pipes and carrying them closer to their final destination outside of the Kawela watershed and placing them somewhere outside of that area may make the project exempt from Chapter 343. He suggests that the Commission consider the environmental impact of leaving trash in the forest and not assume that the project is exempt from Chapter 343.",1,B3,04/18/2023
"the decision that is being considered by the commission regarding the removal of diversion from a stream, which is evaluated as exempt and appropriate. I believe that the exemption declaration is entirely correct, and that the Commission’s authority does not extend beyond the approved action. If there were other actions to be considered, such as whether to stack materials in a concentrated area, it would also fall under the existing exemption. There may be legal discussions and debates about the grandfathering of the materials but the action being proposed is appropriately declared as exempt and recommended by staff. I acknowledge the opposition from an advocate, but I believe that it does not change the analysis or support for the decision, which is consistent with previous decisions made by the Commission.",1,B3,04/18/2023

I acknowledge the concerns raised about Harold’s plan to put the abandoned material on conservation land and suggests that the issue falls within the jurisdiction of the Chair of the Commission as well as the BLNR. We can have a conversation with Michael about the appropriateness of the conservation land for the material but does not want the commission to get hung up on those discussions. The current recommendation to submit a plan within six months that is approved by the staff is the appropriate course of action for the commission at this time.,1,B3,04/18/2023

The proposed site visit is for the Punalu‘u Stream Restoration Project currently being undertaken by Kamehameha Schools on Punalu‘u Stream in Punalu‘u, O‘ahu, Hawai‘i.",1,B1,06/18/2024
"Thank you for the accommodation and the long memory. This goes way back. Please don’t just do this for me. I think this is a really amazing project and Kamehameha stepped up in a big way. We created the plans, but the heavy lifting was done after I retired and to the credit of the team there and their trustees who made that investment to restore a system to what it should be. The abuses of the past in terms of really optimizing certain other values other than the value of the ecosystem there and the stream functions there itself, came at a high cost. That created great risk to the environment as well as to financial interests there, the homes that constantly got flooded and so forth. We’ve done that elsewhere, that’s happened elsewhere and so we thought this would be a model or example to, what can you do? Can you go back and can you restore? I just thought it would be a worthy example for the Commission to review. Thank you.",1,B1,06/18/2024
"I’ll just say I remember before the restoration project, I was working part-time with SWCA with John Ford and Bob Kinzie, who has recently passed.

MOTION: (KATAYAMA / HO) To approve staff recommendation and proposed agenda,1,B1,06/18/2024
"Item B-3, this is Dean Uyeno again with the Stream Protection and Management Branch presenting Item B-3. And this is requesting approval of the Stream Channel Alteration Permit, SCAP.5974.3, by Castle & Cooke Homes Hawai‘i, Incorporated. The project proposes to convey and discharge on-site stormwater runoff into Kipapa Stream that has been consolidated and treated in the Koa Ridge Stormwater Treatment Facilities. The proposed Drain Line 2, or DL2, is designed to accommodate the peak runoff from the second phase, which is the northern portion of the Koa Ridge Development. The drain line will be approximately 1600 feet in length and will consist of two box culverts that discharge into a 12-foot wide trapezoidal channel with articulated concrete blocks that terminates in a riprap channel lining and concrete rubble masonry stream bank protection at Kipapa Stream. A 10-foot by 8-foot box culvert would be constructed in Row G to connect to the upstream portion of Drain Line 2. And staff stands by its submittal. And if I may just read the recommendation that the commission approve the Stream Channel Alteration Permit application that proposed to convey and discharge on-site stormwater runoff into Kipapa Stream that has been consolidated and treated in the Koa Ridge Stormwater Treatment Facilitieses subject to the standard conditions in Exhibit 3 and the special condition below, which is approval of subject of  approve  excuse me, approval is subject to SHPD concurrence. If SHPD requires conditions, authority shall be delegated to the deputy director to attach those as a condition of the Stream Channel Alteration Permit. And that concludes staff's recommendations.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Commission, do you have any questions for Dean?  (No response.)",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Dean, I would  I have this little  I have to be careful  concerns regarding the SHPD. Do they ultimately send you a letter of concurrence?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Yes. It may take a little while. I was in communication with Susan Lebo on this one, and she did",1,B3,06/20/2023
"They were trying to push through this thing. They did admit, admittedly, that they were a little behind.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Okay, very good. Thank you so much. Neil.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Dean, what's the risk of this stormwater runoff containing chemicals, petroleum in particular, from the roadway systems or from which they're gathered and depositing that into our  our streams I would  actually, I'll probably defer to the consultant who is on the call, but my understanding of the stormwater retention facilities is that they will  they are intending to construct detention basins upstream to settle out any  any particulate matter and all of that.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Particulate, but not necessarily, you know, chemical that's",1,B3,06/20/2023
Right. And maybe the consultant can speak to that more in detail.,1,B3,06/20/2023
Is that Mr. Russell Arakaki? Are you the consultant?,1,B3,06/20/2023
"Good morning, Chair, Members of the Commission. My name is Russell Arakaki. I work for Park Engineering, and I am the principal design engineer for the Koa Ridge Off-Site Drain Line No. 2. To answer the question about chemicals, the Koa Ridge project is designing stormwater best management practices to meet the City and County of Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting's requirements for water quality, so we are following their rules. As far as the design, we are designing infiltration methods to get stormwater runoff in the ground where appropriate. There's also filtration systemsIt could be either vegetated filtration or these manufactured treatment devices. So that's all designed or will be designed as part of the Koa Ridge Drainage System. City's reviewing it, they have been reviewing and approving construction plans for the roadways and subdivisions.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Thank you, Mr. Arakaki. So in your professional view, it'll be effective in mitigating any of those concerns?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Yes, it should be.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"That's  that's the best technology that's available now, yeah.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"I have a question. This is maybe for Stream Protection, or maybe Dean. What's the sort of ecological status of Kipapa Stream?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Kipapa Stream is a fairly  so it's a tributary to Waikele Stream, which is a pretty urbanized stream. Ecologically  let me see. I don't have it on hand, but it's  it's pretty filled with invasive species, especially the lower reaches. If I recall correctly  I'm trying to pull up the  sorry, if you'd give me a minute, I'm trying to pull up the  there was also a biological  a stream assessment that was completed by ECOS as part of the  what's it called  environmental impact statement, and they basically found that there'd be no impacts to the biologicas on the stream.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Great. Yeah, yeah. It'd just be nice to sort of have a little bit more detail around it to demonstrate that. So, okay, I mean, I don't know this stream, so it would help to understand because, I mean, a big construction project will have short-term and long-term implications for this.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"If I can kind of just add on, Dean, and maybe Kaleo, what I am finding is that we don't  we don't have really good baseline data on a lot of our streams, so, you know, it's very difficult. We're all  and Mr. Arakaki, I don't question your  your comments; however, I think scientific data is gonna be really helpful to us in the long run. I am  I believe if we had good stream gauges  is there a possibility that we could ask  or maybe I should ask you, Mr. Arakaki, given  given the project that you're doing, are you guys willing to put in a stream gauge in Kipapa to at least give us some good data to monitor the impacts? We hope you are absolutely correct; no impacts by this activity in the stream, but a  anecdotal is nice, but having some scientific measure  so we have a really hard time, the state, putting on stream gauges, but is that a possibility that you could do that? Oh, Ayron, what do you think?",1,B3,06/20/2023
(Inaudible) to let him dance(Laughter.),1,B3,06/20/2023
"Well, only if he's gonna say yes, he can do it.  (Laughter.)",1,B3,06/20/2023
"You're open to  well, I've  go ahead, Ayron, introduce yourself.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection Management Branch.",1,B3,06/20/2023
Waikele Stream is monitored,1,B3,06/20/2023
"long-term monitoring stations across the state, but it's also heavily regulated.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"There are other upstream diversions. When you say monitored, Kipapa Stream has been monitored in terms of flow, but you're interested in more the ecological impacts.",1,B3,06/20/2023
Which a U.S. stream gauge is not gonna help you with.,1,B3,06/20/2023
Okay. So what will help us with that?,1,B3,06/20/2023
Encouraging DAR or the legislature to fund a stream program in the Division of Aquatic Resources.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"Chair, may I ask a question, please?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Mr. Arakaki, once the stormwater is collected and passed through whatever filtration or processing that you're planning, is that covered by NPDES?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Yes, it is. It will be. It'll be under the City and County's NPDES permit.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"So, isn't there a requirement to measure water quality in the discharge?",1,B3,06/20/2023
I'm not sure if measurement and analysis of stormwater is in their NPDES program. I would have to get back to you.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"So the City and County monitors across the island to ensure compliance with the NPDES program, but, you know, they're not monitoring daily, they're monitoring",1,B3,06/20/2023
But isn't the permit issued to,1,B3,06/20/2023
"a system, a person?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"The  it's the accumulation of every point (inaudible). So it's  so, like, for every  in the lake (inaudible), for example, every storm drain outfall, there is a permit for the accumulative impact of that.",1,B3,06/20/2023
But isn't one of the requirements looking at analysis of what is in that discharge?,1,B3,06/20/2023
"Not on a specific basis, no, and not  and this is a DOH issue that doesn't fall under us, but they  they don't monitor specifically any individual outfall.",1,B3,06/20/2023
That  that would be a monitoring burden that would bankrupt the island.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"Can I ask a question then of her, DOH?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Commissioner, I mean, how does DOH  just for our understanding, how does DOH kind of consider the NPDES setting of a project like this? This project or a project like this.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"So I've been out of the Clean Water Branch, which manages the NPDES program, for over ten years, so from what I recall, the municipal separate storm sewer system, the MS4 permit, requires the permittee, the City and County, to  to pre-  to impose BMPs on themselves as well as like those construction projects where you see the  the BMPs in front of the catch basin inlets, things like that. And then, as Mr. Arakaki was saying, the constructed filtration systems, the actual monitoring of the dischargte waters  I don't recall the frequency of that monitoring, but you need to understand that runoff into the storm drains is going to be varying on  on a daily basis because you don't know if somebody had a breakdown on the road and caused an oil spill that might have happened there. So there's monitoring that is done, but I don't know how we can tie it into",1,B3,06/20/2023
"At this point, it's going through a very specific system",1,B3,06/20/2023
that is very specific. So it's being engineered to certain standards.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"And I guess to Mr. Arakaki, what are those standards? I mean, you must be anticipating some kind of input in terms of water quality. So as you're going through the process of treating the water, are you just looking at solids, or are you looking at other things?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"No, it's  it's solids such as sediment.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Trash debris  right, trash debris. But I think the BMPs that meet the City and County rules also look at the removal of other chemical constituents. So one example is a vegetated swale or just a grass swale where you're allowing the runoff to flow through the soil, removing whatever contaminants that are in there.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Ayran, can I kind of follow up with you? I am  at DLNR, we not only look at  I mean, we do a lot of  DAR has a lot of fishing activities. Right? We get a lot of concerns raised by fishermen that they get criticized for impacts to the near shore waters by their fishing activity. We regulate the fishing, but they're saying it's  a lot of it is the mauka activities. So when a permittee comes before us like on a project like this, what  what mechanisms do we have to try to utilize this process to  because you said, oh, DAR could go to the legislature and develop a  you know, like a stream program, but what  and I  and I want to be very reasonable to  to the applicants. I mean, I'm not gonna hold them responsible, but what  what is it that  is there anything that we can do in our process to help more equitably distribute or at least monitor impacts of different activities that may  that may have an effect on the streams that eventually flow down to the nearshore waters?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"So I think there are two not unrelated issues, but one is the ecosystem",1,B3,06/20/2023
"the biota and monitoring the biota, and the other is water quality and the impacts on the ecosystem both in the stream and in the near shore. And best management practices, which they're very well articulated, that control, say, sediment and nutrients in runoff would benefit both the in-stream and nearshore. But as a  take a step back and look at the entire watershed, managing impervious surfaces, managing invasive species in the forest, managing riparian zones, which we, as a whole, don't do a great job of. There are definitely specific instances where the state is doing an excellent job managing the forest, but we have lots of forests that don't fall under the state, and so  and whether it's on private land or whether it's on City County, Federal, coordinating management activities to reduce runoff to increase native vegetation, to improve the health of our ecosystems both within the stream and in the near shore would benefit a host of values Fisheries, cultural practices, whatever, and both from a water quality perspective and an ecosystem perspective. So what can CWRM do? I think I'm going to get (inaudible), but we do our best.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"No, you're  absolutely. But I'm looking more at like  and bear with me, Mr. Arakaki, you're not  you know, I mean, I'm not just looking at targeting you, but I mean, applicants come before us, and they're proposing activities. We have conditions, and people can do BMPs, and they can  but unless we have good data to monitor, we now have  you know, to have a baseline as to, okay, at this point in time, this is the condition of  of the stream or the water quality or the ecosystem. However, over time, we've noticed, based upon new information or some measurements, the changes. Now, that may be due far beyond just  just this particular project, but I think  how to  sharing the opportunity of participation by our community members, including our developers, to help the state better manage our resources. And I'm  I'm just kind of struggling But I think, Kaleo, as a matter of policy  and I'm not going to just pick on Mr. Arakaki, but I think we need to kind of think about that, you know, as conditions. What  what is it that we can ask the applicant that comes before us? And it might be contributing to a fund so that we can work with DAR on doing, you know, better  better management. But I just think that the opportunity presents itself when we're going through an application on the known activities that could have an impact on  on water quality, ecosystem, and  I'm just  you know, how do we as  as citizens of this state collectively try to do  to do better.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Maybe just  I totally get it, and we've talked about these issues",1,B3,06/20/2023
What is before us and I think what,1,B3,06/20/2023
"kind of limits us in certain situations, and this is maybe where statutory amendments",1,B3,06/20/2023
"or other types of rules are required, is the SCAP is a construction permit. It's a two-year permit",1,B3,06/20/2023
"specific to that, and so a lot of the conditions that are recommended",1,B3,06/20/2023
are tied to that period of time.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"What you're talking about is like pre, during, and post",1,B3,06/20/2023
"kind of monitoring and compliance. And so, tying in other conditions that go beyond that two-year period, we have to have a conversation about how to make that happen, right?",1,B3,06/20/2023
And what are  what are the tools available to us. But understanding like these individual projects are all part of this larger ecosystem,1,B3,06/20/2023
"ahupua'a and the moku that we work within, and we all have impacts, whether positive or negative, on those resources. So totally open to strategize",1,B3,06/20/2023
"and look at opportunities, and then  and hear you, basically.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Okay. I do want you guys to think about it 'cause, I mean, I want to be equitable like  you know, this project has a very limited, like, life and potential impact, but if we keep on kicking the can down the road, I mean, we'll never",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Exactly, so  but I don't know how to differentiate that.",1,B3,06/20/2023
I have a thought and a suggestion.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"As an educator and also just watching the color of Mānoa Stream change over the last week very quickly with rain and no rain, would it be  would this applicant be willing to  and I've seen people do this with the telecam, like ecologists put a camera on a  on a plant so that you can just watch it as it flowers. You know, would the applicant be willing to maybe work with a local school  'cause that's Mililani, right, right nearby?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"You know, I mean, potentially work  for educational and outreach purposes, put a camera above the project site and below, and just let people kind of watch the stream. It's not  I mean, it is a form of data, but it's",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Maybe there's a better idea, but I just wanted to put it out there as a way for people to engage with their streams. 'Cause I'm currently working on urban equality. On Maui, we have people who are organized, who are constantly watching the stream, who are in the stream. We don't really have that on Oahu, and so we forget that the stream exists and don't care about it, don't (inaudible) put cash into it on all kinds. So I  I think, you know, would people be willing to entertain that as an idea for  for the duration of the project?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"I mean, I think that's an excellent  I think for me, it's  the community needs to feel a sense of ownership to these resources. If they don't see it, they don't know about it, and who best but  but kids. But it does make a difference, and I think  I'm just trying to find different opportunities and venues and platforms where, one, we're not only engaging and educating, but we're also getting good data for us to make better-informed decisions because that's  that is my  you know, there's so much unknown, I mean, I don't even know what questions to ask. But I think when  when a project comes before us",1,B3,06/20/2023
I don't know when.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"you know, sort of that shared responsibility. So I don't know, Mr. Arakaki, you  I think you're getting  this is like, I only came in here for this permit, what  what is all this about? But, I mean, I think  I'm hoping you're hearing. I  obviously, we've got a lot, you know, more to think about with the  within the department, but I think you kind of hear some of our sentiments. I don't know if you have any thoughts or comments.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"I just want to add that  I did mention we're following the city's rules. Part of that rule allows the use of manufactured treatment devices, so these are prefabricated units; they also remove nutrients, heavy metals, other hydrocarbons, other contaminants, so that's also being designed with this drainage system.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"And that I think is significant, onecomparison between someone who's using sort of this   this less intrusive material versus others who are doing traditional construction. Is there a difference on the impacts to our  our ecosystem? I  I don't know. All I'm suggesting is if there's a mechanism for us to utilize these applications and these projects as they come before us to sort of share in this inquiry.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"And maybe  maybe if I can, Chair,and maybe a recommendation is we can maybe tap City and County of Honolulu as well as Department of Health's Clean Water Branch to maybe come in and use their, you know, NPDES permit as a way to kind of share, right, the BMPs, the technologies, the work that they have and are currently doing. And then maybe areas where they need more help",1,B3,06/20/2023
"or more data, and that's where maybe we could fill the gap on the policy side. Maybe that's a recommendation I can propose and can bring it  bring them to the commission and see if they're willing to engage at that level.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"I just want to be constructive, but I",1,B3,06/20/2023
"I also realize DLNR, we don't have enough resources to do what needs to be done, but we know",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Well, I  I appreciate your line of discussion, and it gets to, really, if having this body be more informed as to what those best practices are so that when different consultants or different applicants come before us, we can kind of",1,B3,06/20/2023
check their proposal against our knowledge. But right now our  I think our knowledge may be,1,B3,06/20/2023
"you know, fragmented across the spectrum of membership. And I'm wondering if there's some space or a way we can have an informational briefing from the industry, from the regulatory bodies, as you have suggested, Kaleo, from landowner developers in terms of what are the  what should we expect of modern developments these days? What is the highest, you know, standard for what we're creating that would really allow for the development of lands and  in ways that really are beneficial to the environment and not harmful to the environment.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"So I think there's  a lot has changed, I mean, in the industry, and I'm  they're attending to the impacts that they have, and I think it's incumbent upon them to raise the standard to be  to create a competitive edge for themselves as consultants, as developers. And so let's get a briefing and figure out what those  where they are.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Yeah, and then  I'll just jump in. And this  this is actually really exciting because water quality is  is going to be the next  the focus, in my opinion, of this commission and Department of Health",1,B3,06/20/2023
in the next couple of years.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"With new emerging contaminants and regulations, but also just how do we holistically manage that? And then, as you mentioned, Chair, the real ripple effect it has, the mauka-to-makai connection on all of our resources, all of our programs here at DLNR. It's real, and finding out how those are connected is going to be really, really important.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Very true. And I guess I'm also just trying to be more equitable. I mean, we cannot hold the last developer responsible for all of the past. So how do we share some of that management responsibility, whether it's monitoring, whether it's, you know, BMPs? But I recognize that we do have to be  we have to be more proactive. We are constantly reacting to a crisis, so how do we have good information to be more proactive and have  make an informed decision, but also share proportionately with those that come before us to utilize our public resources. And, you know, how do we get them to help share in that, that opportunity to meet these challenges, but Oh. And thank you for entertaining sort of my  my little  what I'm  I am trying to use every opportunity to help supplement DLNR meet its goals and its missions. But thank you very much And thank you, Mr. Arakaki. Is there  do you have anybody else from your team that would like to speak or  you know, because I noticed you do have several from Castle & Cooke that are here as well as from PAR Engineering.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"There's one other person from Engineering Concepts, also a design consultant. I don't think Castle & Cooke is on the  on the video.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Well, actually there  can you just  because I didn't pull it out mentally from the submittal, just explain  you mentioned you're aligned with best management practices, and you gave more detail about it's not just a sediment retention basin, but there are more filtration processes. Do you have any pictures? I mean, I think I saw a, you know, kind of conceptual design. So we can better understand, you know, what  what you folks are doing and  and how it is  you know, it's  you're not just trying to do minimal compliance, you're actually trying to really clear the  the stormwater.",1,B3,06/20/2023
Let's see if I can pull up a website.,1,B3,06/20/2023
You're asking someone older to (inaudible).,1,B3,06/20/2023
"And I'm gonna see if I can share my screen. Oh, I  okay, I'm disabled from sharing the screen.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Can we do that, Kathy?",1,B3,06/20/2023
Yeah. You should be able to share now.,1,B3,06/20/2023
Got it. Can you see my screen now?,1,B3,06/20/2023
"Okay. This is one product that we are  Castle & Cooke is installing. Stormwater goes in this chamber, and it gets filtered through these cartridges",1,B3,06/20/2023
"which removes the sediment, trash, debris, as well as heavy metals, hydrocarbons. So that this is just one product.",1,B3,06/20/2023
Just gotta be sure you don't release the Kraken.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"So you've gotta clean it a bit before it gets  gets to that stage, right?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"That's right. So maintenance, removal of trash and debris. Let's see. This kind of shows stormwater going through the chamber, but there's also a trash and debris collection area here; these are the filters, and then it goes out downstream to Kipapa Stream.",1,B3,06/20/2023
Compared to what comes off the stream.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"What's the capacity of that? Because, like, you know, larger",1,B3,06/20/2023
could easily exceed that.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"Yeah. The capacity is nowhere near the peak flows that we're designing the off-site drainage system for. It's typically  it's very small. It's a smaller storm, one inch, one inch of rainfall.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"But then the swales, too, should also function as well. I guess I'm thinking most sediment transport happens in the bigger events anyways, and so if you're only designing for the small events and  you're kind of maybe missing some of the most significant",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Sediment shouldn't be released. Whatever gets in here, the  the city's design criteria is not to treat the  peak flow, you know, whether it's the ten-year or  or larger storms.",1,B3,06/20/2023
Okay. So it sounds like a conversation with the city.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"Yeah, I mean  yeah.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Russell, can I add to that?",1,B3,06/20/2023
Okay. Doraine Young is on.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"Okay. I'm Doraine Young, and I'm with Engineering Concepts. Sorry, I was having problems with my camera. But I wanted to add that the reason why the city chose a one-inch rainstorm is that's usually 80 percent of the runoff that occurs. So that's the reason why the one-inch storm is used.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Makes perfect logic, right? Eighty percent of the runoff.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Probably. Eighty percent of the runoff happens two percent of the time, you know, so, yeah. I mean, if the coral's getting blanketed, it's happening at the high end. So that sounds like a good conversation to have across the city (inaudible).",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Yeah. I think it'll be good to talk city. I mean, even all of the counties on how they're managing stormwater. I mean, we haven't engaged in stormwater, but it is a big  a big issue that we have to talk about and falls within the context of the commission Water Resource Division. So we'll  we'll try to bring forward, you know, this thread of conversation to the commission. It's something that we haven't really focused on, but I do think it does have impacts on the commission's overall policy setting and decision making, so",1,B3,06/20/2023
"All right. Russell, when you designed this system, you must have looked at the effluent that you are planning to handle in the one-inch events. Have you  what's the analysis of that water sample?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"We did not do any water quality analysis. Currently, it's not a requirement.",1,B3,06/20/2023
But you're designing a system to do something.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"But you don't know what you're gonna  that something is that you've gotta handle, right?",1,B3,06/20/2023
That's right. So all the (Laughter.),1,B3,06/20/2023
All the test  yeah. All,1,B3,06/20/2023
"I mean, shouldn't you sortwhat you're gonna handle even at the one-inch events?",1,B3,06/20/2023
I'm assuming that it had historical one-inch flows or some flows currently.,1,B3,06/20/2023
"Correct. All of the testing of these systems that we're specifying are done by the manufacturer, and they follow guidelines of, let's say, New Jersey and other jurisdictions. So they need to meet the water quality treatment requirements that were established. This is all approved by EPA and then passed down to Department of Health, and then on to the City and County as part of their NPDES program. So at this time, there's no requirement to look at or measure the pollutants that enter the system and leave the treatment system.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Okay. No, that's fine. A different conversation, but thank you.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"I know  Russell, I'm sure this is much more than you had thought you were gonna get into.(Laughter.)",1,B3,06/20/2023
"He's like, Am I here for the (inaudible)? No, we appreciate you, your patience, and, you know, answering our questions. Any more questions, comments, Commission?(No response.)",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Anybody else, Kathy, in the audience?",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Commission, are you ready for the vote? Call for the vote.",1,B3,06/20/2023
"Okay. The motion has been moved and seconded to approve staff's recommendation for Item B-3. All in favor, say aye.(Response.)",1,B3,06/20/2023
"The motion has been unanimously approved. Thank you very much, Russell and your team. Thank you, Dean.",1,B3,06/20/2023

"Request and Delegation of Authority to Chairperson to Enter into a Joint Funding Agreement with U.S. Geological Survey For Statewide Hydrologic Data Collection and Water Resource Monitoring for Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2024, and Declare that Project is Exempt from Environmental Assessment Requirements under Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 343 and Hawaii Administrative Rules Chapter 11.200.1",1,B1,08/15/2023
"Dr. Ayron Strauch, CWRM Stream Protection and Management Branch",1,B1,08/15/2023
Dr. Strauch provided a summary of the Joint Funding Agreement and gave updates on monitoring stations across the State.,1,B1,08/15/2023
"Questions? So, ADC didn’t respond?",1,B1,08/15/2023
Maybe we should send them another letter.,1,B1,08/15/2023
"They also lost their chairperson, so they’ve been going through some transition periods.",1,B1,08/15/2023
Seems to be a simple yes or no.,1,B1,08/15/2023
"Dawn, do you know if ADC is still a state agency or is it a?",1,B1,08/15/2023
"It’s administratively attached to DBEDT. So, they do have an acting director, Mark Takemoto. Maybe it’s time, maybe we just have to revisit because Wahiawa Ditch, I mean that may end up becoming a state...",1,B1,08/15/2023
Or maybe we can just turn the water off. Make them answer.,1,B1,08/15/2023
"Well, there will be people above our paygrade who will not be happy with that. Ayron, what is our cost here? There’s a table one and a table two.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"So, is that what we’re paying? Is that what this is?",1,B1,08/15/2023
"Yes. We are paying the $999,964 of the total agreement cost which is $1,231,078.",1,B1,08/15/2023
Is that out of a general fund? Where are we getting that from? Dr. Strauch: It’s a combination of general and special funds.,1,B1,08/15/2023
"And that’s on plan, I mean we anticipated this, we have the funds for it.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"Ayron, excuse me chair.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"No, no please go ahead.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"That’s the table I’m sort of getting to. Is that the normal ongoing operating cost for the entire system, about a million a year?",1,B1,08/15/2023
"Unfortunately, with inflation the costs went up quite a bit, unanticipated costs. I had anticipated that the costs would be more like $950,000 for us, but it was about $50,000 more than expected just because of inflation. We have over the years, I don’t know if I documented it in this, but we’ve added something around 17 stations since 2014 to improve our understanding of the impacts of management on water supply as well as climate change and re-establishing some of these long-term stations so we’ve really built up a more robust network than what existed 10 years ago and that has cost.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"So, the USGS relationship is always going to be an 80/20.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"Unfortunately, I believe their matching dollars have remained static for like 30 years. I mean Chris might be able to comment on the Federal side, but just because we add another station doesn’t mean, on the Federal side, they get more money.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"I guess that was sort of the genesis of my question with Chris is that, what’s the breaks on, we have a plan or we have a dream of what gaging stations are important to us and it seems like the ceiling becomes Federal funds if we want to maintain that 80/20 relationship.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"Agreed. Deputy Manuel was able to request from the legislature with the previous chair’s assistance, addition to our general funds that help support the additional gaging five years ago. Our ceiling isn’t necessarily the Federal side, but it is a combination of Federal and State.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"If I can, Chair, we’ve been coordinating with our counterparts at USGS and as well as our Congressional delegation to really look at increasing the Federal matching percentage and the funding that goes to this specific program and this is in partnership with other state agencies that benefit from USGS data. It’s a nationwide attempt to try to increase that budget, that Federal budget which then also helps us go across the street and ask for additional funds to show the leverage that’s happening. We’ve consistently every year asked for an increase to our base funding to add potentially five gages and focus on streams every year which on average what we budget was about $250,000. And if we do that every biennium, we should be able to over the course of, I think we pencil it on it’ll take 20 years, but that’s the reality right and we’ve been trying to be realistic about our asks as well as the capacity of USGS to install gages.",1,B1,08/15/2023
Is that consistent with what our assumptions are with the climate change models that we’ve been looking at over the past year or two?,1,B1,08/15/2023
"No, the amount of gaging stations that we’re putting in to try to manage.",1,B1,08/15/2023
We have a Water Resource Monitoring Needs Assessment the USGS published three years ago.,1,B1,08/15/2023
"That identifies all the climate, surface water, and groundwater monitoring needs that the State has. You use that as kind of our baseline, but obviously we need 80 more stream gages or something like that and we have to make a decision on which one to add next year. We really focus on very high priority sites that are involved in litigation, involved with the water leasing process, tied to instream flow standards; areas that we call hot, hot areas for us.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"As well as streams that can act as proxies for larger research. So that was the balance with the monitoring program and attempt to say ‘Hey, with the budget we have, let’s come up with a strategy to build out our monitoring system in anticipation of climate change. Obviously, we may need to redirect resources as needed, but in general if this is the path and the plan that both USGS as well as us here at the Water Commission can take, we can move and adjust as needed, but we needed like a general plan, right? A navigation plan to get us where we need to go.",1,B1,08/15/2023
But a 20-year horizon seems a bit far.,1,B1,08/15/2023
"I used that number broadly based on various criteria and limits. A lot of it’s budget, the other one is USGS’s capacity to install gages. You know the more money we get the more Federal funding they get, they can bring on more staff and add more gages. So, there are a lot of conditions that need to be considered whether that timeframe increases or decreases.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"But we know that data is critical to informed decision making. How do we share the cost? There are others who are benefiting from this work. I mean we’re just now going after the county water departments, but I mean are there other whether they’re military, whether they’re private purveyors. Can we assess like some kind of a monitoring fee? How do we do this? We need to think about it.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"Chair, the Water Resource Protection Plan adopted in 2019 looked at how to help sufficiently fund this type of data collection at work because getting people to pay for data is really difficult. Obviously, we wish we had data when we want to make decisions, but we are not always investing in it proactively. So, part of that strategy was to look at ways in which we could look at, for example, regulatory fees or that would then be shared amongst all users that would go towards funding stream gages that they benefit from as end users. Those things we’ve been working through. A lot of it has to go through rule making in order for us to pursue those types of fees. And or if there’s need for legislation then that’s something else we need to consider. I will say it’s hard, it has been difficult and challenging to add more fees to things, but data collection somebody’s got to pay for it. We’re looking at multiple ways to do that. We’re also looking at accessing other Federal programs that can help us support the work that we’re doing. I know in prior conversation, I think it was Commissioner Hannahs, brought up ideas of philanthropic supports. We have tried to coordinate as much as possible with other organizations to leverage funding.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"To build on your question, we are not the only cooperator. For example, the City and County Department of planning and Department of Environmental Management are cooperators for maybe six stream gages related to water quality monitoring or NPDS development. Army does monitor or cost share a couple of stations, so like the Waipahu Stream near Wheeler Field, that’s a stream up in Mililani. And then Army Corps of Engineers also supports certain streams, especially in the Ala Wai watershed.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"Department of Transportation also is a huge presence, mostly for flood- prone streams to protect highways and bridges.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"All right. Any other questions? Do I have a motion? Oh, I’m sorry. Paul do you have one? No?",1,B1,08/15/2023
"Lucienne, I think, is here for public testimony.",1,B1,08/15/2023
"Oh I’m sorry, Lucienne, you’re here for Item B-1? Would you like to provide testimony?",1,B1,08/15/2023
"Yes, I would. Excuse me, I need to plug in my computer, it tells me it’s about to die. All right, there we go, we’re plugged in. Thank you, I really appreciate all the discussion and moving the report by Director Curran up so that we really could get this big picture of how the monitoring program works. I’m testifying in full support of having the authority to proceed to get the data we need. It’s obvious that USGS is the gold standard of getting this kind of information and presenting it in a way that it can, been applied where it needs to be applied. Fun fact, when we were a territory and didn’t have a Department of Land and Natural Resources, USGS acted kind of de facto as our, for our territory as a Department of Land and Natural Resources. They did lots of gages and monitoring and studies and reports and things, so they’re a long and trusted partner. I would like to echo Commissioner Hannahs’ comments that there is longer term knowledge available. I would like to suggest some partner groups and I’m sorry, I’m a little disorganized today. I don’t have this in writing, but I will send in writing. There are partner groups in all parts of the island that do have what’s called generational knowledge and a lot of information about streams for instance can be derived from the amount of infrastructure for kalo cultivation that is around those streams. A lot of times these areas have had archaeological dating as well so we can know that in the 1500s, there was enough water to support so many acres of kalo cultivation. And I do know, having worked with some of the former USGS staff members that have come to Maui to Na Wai ‘Eha or East Maui where I live, that they are interested in knowing what the local families who have watched things for years and years have seen. They don’t always have a way to quantify that, but they do take it into account when they are trying to plan their test runs and things like that. They can get a lot of good advice. So please consider in this model your local, cultural organizations and there are many in Maui. There are cultural organizations, and I will send in a list and contact information, in every part of the island and these are great resources. I also want to say that we really need to understand how our aquifers and our surface water interrelate. For instance, an earlier USGS report indicated that restoring stream flows to even you know, basically small amounts, but significant amounts, actually helped the health of the county well system in Na Wai ‘Eha. I’m sure the same would be true in West Maui. I think the USGS study in 2012-2013 concluded that as well. We really need to be very long-range thinking about stream flow standards and the good that they do in order to keep the aquifers recharged and because we depend on the aquifers so much. Thank you to Director Manuel and Chair Chang and all the Commission staff and members for supporting this important work and to USGS for always being there for us.",1,B1,08/15/2023

"Thank you Ayron for the pictures as well, very interesting. Overall, what kind of condition do you think the pipes, the channels, the systems it’s in at this point and is there a substantial amount of deferred maintenance to leaks and unintended spills?",0,B3,10/24/2023
"I don’t think that’s the case. I think most of the ditch is concrete and the few pukas that are in place have been sealed over the years. The siphon is old but it's holding up. I'm not sure on long-term maintenance plan, but the forebay over the years or the penstock to Kauaʻula Hydropower Plant over the years has taken damage and been repaired over and over again. So, there's probably more work that could be done, but it's in pretty good shape overall.",0,B3,10/24/2023
"Continuing on the line of questioning about the condition of the system, we had a decision of the Commission that in lieu of a fine of nearly half a million dollars, the landowner was to make an investment, commence an investment in the rehabilitation largely of the reservoir systems there. Is there evidence that that work has been completed?",0,B3,10/24/2023

"Thanks, Ayron for giving us the sort of slideshow view. I was just wondering as Commissioners, except for Chair Chang, we haven't had the privilege of seeing the whole system and so can you give us an impression of your current view on the whole system and where as Commissioners we should really be paying attention to? I think we have abundant testimony that's going to help us focus on Mokuhinia, but it all flows from up there. You can give us your opinion on, I mean there are certain sites you visited for certain reasons. Are there sort of broad take homes from that field trip?",0,B3,10/24/2023
"The sites were chosen because they represent key points in the system in terms of water decision-making; how much water can be removed from the stream, how much water might get allocated to one user or another user, how much water gets returned to the stream, what alternatives exist, groundwater or surface water, and what are the consequences of utilizing those groundwater sources in terms of potential downstream hydrological effects. So, higher level on the instream flow standard we will discuss in another PowerPoint and then the groundwater consequences, it's going to depend on other analyses like water use permits and that sort of thing that I'm not prepared to talk about right now.",0,B3,10/24/2023
"Okay, I have a follow up question. Just looking from the old map, it looks like Mokuhinia is completely spring fed and so we need to think about surface-groundwater connections. Do we have an ability to understand the status of the groundwater in this area? Wells other than spring flow or lack of?",0,B3,10/24/2023
We're working on monitoring. We are getting pump rates at least on a daily basis and we're working with our groundwater team to assess the consequences of groundwater withdrawals on spring flows.,0,B3,10/24/2023
Are there any shallow wells where you can monitor chlorides?,0,B3,10/24/2023
"Yeah, the shafts are.",0,B3,10/24/2023
But is there data coming from them?,0,B3,10/24/2023
"Off the top of my head, I'm not sure. I’m not the groundwater team.",0,B3,10/24/2023
"Okay, sorry. I’m just trying to understand what information we need to better understand this complex system. You know, there's been a lot of calls for recycling. Are there opportunities or would that even make sense for Kauaʻula?",0,B3,10/24/2023
That's also in another presentation.,0,B3,10/24/2023

It is not currently active. It was active up until 2018. What's the max capacity of the penstock? Is that the question?,0,B3,10/24/2023
"Well, that leads to the question that you mentioned that the flow out of the penstock was used to pressurize water to feed existing users.",0,B3,10/24/2023
The pen stock is pressurized by the...,0,B3,10/24/2023
But the water exiting the forebay that is what's driving the head to deliver water?,0,B3,10/24/2023
"Yeah, but because of the variable inflows from the stream...",0,B3,10/24/2023
I assume it’s a run of the river hydro?,0,B3,10/24/2023
"Yes, that variable inflow changes the pressure felt at the nozzle and therefore the amount of water. They don't want to blow the pipes and they want to have sufficient pressure to get water uphill. The operator has to constantly adjust the valve because the system was never designed to deliver water uphill. We can get into the details later.",0,B3,10/24/2023

Under existing low flow conditions, there is no flow.However, proposed additional modifications to Hoʻolawa nui at Wailoa ditch, which is upstream of here, will increase the base flow to the stream. Therefore, there is expected to be some flow here. The idea is to prevent the diversion of any flow, low or high, at this location and allow it to continue downstream. This is an abandonment of the stream diversion works, so no water will ever be diverted at this location.",1,B2,05/16/2023
"what I'd like to do is Ayron, you do your overview for each of these and any questions from the Commissioners. Then I'd like to make sure that either Ken or Roy confirms that Ayron’s description is consistent with your understanding. So, any questions from the Commissioners on Ayron's overview?",1,B2,05/16/2023
"we know that the issue is going to arise as to how much you have the applicant remove so in this case, they're not removing everything.",1,B2,05/16/2023
"no because you can see the concrete structure that the ditch flowing in right here, so this is the ditch is flowing right here.",1,B2,05/16/2023
"we'll break that wall and create a gap and capture flow, but the applicant will be allowed to leave in place all that other infrastructure.",1,B2,05/16/2023
"yeah, like this wing wall here it keeps debris out of the ditch. There are parts of the concrete specifically protecting the ditch. I believe some of these walls can be removed but I don't know to the extent how much.",1,B2,05/16/2023
"so, Ayron, the current recommendation is just to remove the grate and seal the hole in a ditch and there's been no recommendations to modify that wall at this time.",1,B2,05/16/2023
that’s not what I heard.,1,B2,05/16/2023
"correct so that's why I'm speaking to them across the box, and this is also internal coordination. So, we have a permit branch and Dean is in charge of both the current side as well as the in-stream side. So, we're cross walking the recommendation which is primarily focused on the IIFS. And then the permitting or abandonment of the diversions that's handled by another branch in surface water. So, what's being proposed or recommended in the application is to remove the grate and seal the hole, so the intake no longer functions. But there's been no recommended modifications of that wall that's basically holding up the ditch. Ayron said he thinks it could be done, that's not what's in the application. I just want to make that clear.",1,B2,05/16/2023
"there might be modifications to the wall that are permissible without damaging the structural integrity of it. These modifications could include notching the wall, putting pukas through it, or concrete over the intake. The primary purpose is to remove the diversion from its function by sealing it. Concrete over the intake would ensure that no water could be diverted.",1,B2,05/16/2023
Roy actually has the applications up which I think is not visible by the Commissioners. But Roy can look at the applications on what was submitted and clarify any differences.,1,B2,05/16/2023
"thank you Ken, generally what Deputy Manuel clarified is correct. There was nothing about the removal of the wall that Ayron is talking about. It is just sealing the intake to allow all the floors to bypass.",1,B2,05/16/2023
"I would maybe recommend that the submittal request that EMI evaluate how much of the wall can be removed, without damaging the integrity of the ditch and proceed with that.",1,B2,05/16/2023
"Ayron maybe to help facilitate the conversation. With a re-establishment of the IIFS or modifications upstream of this diversion, what is the flow that's anticipated below that upper diversion or is this the losing part of the stream or is it a gaining part of the stream?",1,B2,05/16/2023
"it's a gaining stream. There is a large lava tube at the base of a waterfall just below the Wailoa ditch on Ho‘olawa nui. The goal is to get all of these low flows downstream to the in-stream values such as recreational needs, repairing uses, and aquatic habitat. To the extent that we don't want the water pooling up behind the dam, pukas can be put into it if a notch can be cut out of it to convey the water downstream more effectively.",1,B2,05/16/2023
"I am wondering if it would be better for staff to go back and work with the applicant and then resubmit the application when there has been some internal discussion. I am concerned about Ken’s HRS 343 question, and do you think it might be more productive to have an internal discussion with the applicant before proceeding?",1,B2,05/16/2023
I think we can work through it today. I don't think many of the recommendations are substantial. I'm busy on the in-stream use section side of things as you will find out later and finding time to meet to discuss regulatory issues is challenging.,1,B2,05/16/2023
"Kaleo, do you have a recommendation?",1,B2,05/16/2023
"yeah, I’m open. The goal is to give the commission a timeline to modify and abandon in order to meet the IIFS. There was a similar recommendation in November, an application that came in and the proposed modifications. If we could potentially defer and have this conversation in the June quarterly meeting as it relates to abandonments and then come back in July or August if you feel more comfortable.",1,B2,05/16/2023
because based on hearing Ken's opening remarks; and just my own concern part of your submittal isn't 343 exemption and if indeed we are going to be doing work that may trigger 343. I would rather have that internally discussed before it comes back to the commission.,1,B2,05/16/2023
can we walk through the submittal however. I don't believe that we're that far off with what Ken had an issue with. Many of these modifications are going to be full stream diversion abandonments which the applicant knows wasn't up for discussion.,1,B2,05/16/2023
"yeah, Ayron let's table for now because I'd rather make sure we are in alignment before we continue the conversation so we can just defer for now.",1,B2,05/16/2023
We don’t need a motion on that.,1,B2,05/16/2023
"no, we’ll defer for now.",1,B2,05/16/2023
they still have the right to testify.,1,B2,05/16/2023
"yes. Commissioners, do you have any questions about the deferral and what's being proposed? We'll take public comments.",1,B2,05/16/2023
"Thank you for bringing this up. It seems that Mr. Kawahara may have provided some misleading information. I want to clarify the importance of the distinction between temporary and permanent abandonment. According to Black’s Law Dictionary, “abandon:” means to give up, cease to use, forsake, entirely, or renounce utterly. When a structure is abandoned but left in place, it implies that the structure will remain there permanently. If the proposed structures are abandoned in place within the stream, it could lead to legal challenges in the future if you decide to remove them after two, ten, or twenty years. By expressing their intention to abandon the structures, they are essentially indicating a desire for permanent abandonment. This highlights the significance of the recommendations from the Division of Aquatic Resources, which your staff has agreed to. These recommendations aim for a balanced approach and advocate for the removal of structures where feasible instead of leaving them abandoned in place. It’s worth noting that the Sierra Club doesn’t request the removal of every single structure in every stream being proposed for abandonment. The focus is on areas where it is possible and appropriate to remove the entire structure, rather than abandoning it in place. The financial responsibility for these structures should not be shifted onto the Sierra Club or washed away. They should not be left in the stream as it goes against the objective of preserving the stream’s integrity. Additionally, the amount of water proposed to be left in these streams is minimal. The diversions being discussed do not aim for full restoration, and it is doubtful that any of them achieve 64 percent of the base flow. These streams require more water to sustain their health. When considering Mr. Kawahara’s suggestion that these structures may be needed for future water requirements, implies that all the water from these streams will eventually need to be removed. This is a path we should not venture down. We should no longer deplete streams entirely, and that’s why the permanent removal of the proposed abandoned structures is crucial. If they express a need for more water from these streams in the future, they should be required to go through the process of justifying their request, as outlined in a 343 document. They should apply and provide a case for whether all the water should be taken from these streams. This process is necessary and should be followed, just as it was historically more than 100 years ago. It’s important to support the permanent removal of abandoned structures and engage in productive conversations that align with this approach. Lastly, if this matter is to be discussed further, it would be helpful to have additional and improved photographs that present a more comprehensive picture, particularly concerning the abandoned PVC and other pipes that are not adequately depicted in the existing photographs. Thank you.",1,B2,05/16/2023

Because with this one-time funding or training, if we're interested in developing capacity we should think about the fact that there is workforce turnover and we need to ensure people get hired on after the workshops learn. You mentioned hopefully people will develop capacity but it would be good to not just hope.

"I think it's good because like I said I'm reading now, you had me on the on the search looking at previous minutes from Kauaʻi and I heard that's good. It’s going to be across islands and just the suggestion from Commission member that just mentioned having this recorded for trainings because I'm looking at the January 20, 2022 minutes, the draft minutes and it was talking about that chief engineer mentioning about benchmarks. There's no way to measure and the department does not have a pipe replacing program and the fact that right here, new people coming in, retired staff going out. It's good to have that available and for review. The second part to this that it's good for the meter, the reading, this training because of the fact that right now in ʻEwa Beach in the Gentry area it was brought up at the ʻEwa Beach neighborhood board meeting that there's apparently again a 15 million at the minimum, 25 million gallon per month leak from that development area. This one couple came forward, I mentioned it because the Board of Water Supply had threatened to turn off the water for like 621 families or homes. This type of issue really needs to be looked at. I don't know actually the role and the length and your coordination with this Commission with the Board of Water Supply and individual development areas but this type of issue is currently happening and it has apparently been happening for many months and years. This is a leak that they cannot find but because of the distinction between a private development and then the state or whatever that they can't go in. There was another issue brought up with Billingham and Brenton Awai. It's good that you guys have this monitoring and my question was do you have information about that from BOW? I don't know your working relationship and then knowing about leaks that are happening with water reading and water leaks because you're going to be doing this training. If that is related, which I thought it was, if that helps you for gathering input and for having this training available because apparently it's the issue in Kauaʻi meetings about meters and reading and all of everything that you're just discussing now for this MOA B-2.",1,B2,11/21/2023

"Hi, good morning, Chair Chang, and Commissioners. For the record my name is Elena Bryant testifying on behalf of Earthjustice and we’d like to testify in support of the staff recommendation for agenda items B1 and B2 and we implore this Commission to approve KIUC’s (Kaua’i Island Utility Cooperative) stream channel alteration permit and stream diversion works permit without further delay. These permits are the final approvals needed for KIUC to fulfill its monitoring and reporting obligations under the Waimea Watershed Agreement which this Commission has already ordered six years ago and that the community has been waiting for nearly seven years. I’d be happy to provide more context on the Waimea Watershed Agreement, if needed but basically the agreement outlined two phases and phase one went into effect upon Commission approval of the agreement which occurred in May of 2017. and that phase one required immediate restoration of flows to the maximum extent possible: simple modifications on the ditch system diversion such as removing a board or lifting a gate and also monitoring and reporting requirements. Here we are nearly seven years later and most if not all of these requirements have been outstanding and by letter dated August 2, 2023, Earthjustice documented these concerns related to ongoing violations to the Commission and asked the Commission to take prompt and firm action to enforce these terms. I had a chance to review ADC (Agribusiness Development Corporation) and KAA’s testimony and just wanted to make three quick responses to that. The first, we’ve held quarterly compliance meetings since 2018 and KAA and ADC have been parties at all of those compliance meetings, including the most recent one two weeks ago on January 11th and never once expressed any concern about KIUC fulfilling its phase one obligations under the agreement. As far as KAA’s requests to deny the application to allow additional time for collaborative discussions, we maintain that as outlined in our August 2023 letter, we’ve documented years of ongoing violations and progress in the compliance meeting remains painfully slow or non-existent. If anything, I think that track record or lack thereof speaks for itself. The testimony also raises the hydrologist meeting which was proposed to address what the modifications to the diversions would be done and reviewing the meeting summary notes that KAA provided to the compliance group. There’s nothing that’s going to be done to at least two of the diversions, Waiakōali and Kawaikōī. At the very minimum, these permits would allow KIUC to do reporting and monitoring of what is actually being taken into the ditch, what’s being put back into the stream. Waiakōali is especially concerning because KAA previously reported that there was a throwback that was returning flows that were diverted. We had asked for months for verification of that throwback, and it wasn’t until Dr. Ayron Strauch went up and verified that the throwback is not returning anything to the streams. I think at this point the Commission needs to take action and the first step is by approving these permits so we can get basic monitoring and reporting requirements fulfilled. I’m happy to answer any other questions that the Commission might have for me.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Aloha mai kākou, Commissioners. Good morning, my name for the record is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer and I’m appearing here today on behalf of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. I like perhaps many of the Commissioners when we saw the agenda last week thought, okay this is a fairly quick and straightforward action item, and we didn’t even plan to testify. Previously DHHL when these diversions were contemplated as phase one of a multiphase process of implementing the Waimea Watershed Agreement and the West Kauaʻi Energy Project thought it was a straightforward action. We were contacted by KAA Friday, I believe, and had a chance to talk to them Monday and the information that was conveyed to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands was that...we have, if you don’t know, about 16,000 acres of land that are on the slopes above the Mānā plain and we have a reservation of 6.9 million gallons a day granted by this Commission to deliver water to some of those lands to allow settlement. We have a homesteader as well as a homestead association tenant on those lands now that rely on water that is diverted by the system. We don’t operate the system, we rely on ADC and KAA to deliver water in the system and what they have conveyed to us is that if these phase one modifications that are considered in both items B1, this item, and B2, the next item, go through there will be perhaps six months of the year where our tenants will have no water delivered to them. That’s obviously a very concerning issue since our tenants have cattle and plants and other things that rely on diversion waters. We have not obviously since this came up on Friday and getting more details midday yesterday had any chance to do any verification of any of these things. It does occur to me that most of the members of this Commission now are not members of the Commission when the Waimea Watershed Agreement was reached and that the very recent dissolution of the proposed West Kauaʻi Energy Project which was both a key part of the Waimea Watershed Agreement as well as the mechanism by which DHHL was going to be able to efficiently get at no cost to us water to our lands so that we could homestead those lands. The best path might be for the Commission to defer action on these two items to ask the staff and perhaps the parties to brief you both on the Waimea Watershed Agreement in general and its current status as well as the status of the West Kauaʻi Energy Project at your next meeting and then take up these permits with that background, perhaps at the March meeting. I would be happy to answer any questions.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Aloha, Dawn Huff here on behalf of KIUC. I don’t have any testimony, I’m just here to answer any questions if there are any.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Because we’re trying to understand the changes that have been brought by the modification of the West Kauaʻi Energy Project, we’re just requesting that the Commission defer or deny the approval of the permits for the moment pending resolution through the Waimea Watershed Agreement working group. With that I’m here to answer any questions to the extent that I can.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Since I’m new to this, Jonathan, I think you said that this past Friday you were informed that the homestead lands would not be able to get water if this went through. How come this came up so late? It seems to me that this has been going on for what, seven years? And then now right before a decision comes up? I would like anybody out there to explain to me what happened.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Chair, may I quickly respond because the question was directed to me by Commissioner Miike? The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands has indeed sort of tracked this closely and we were aware of this permit coming up. We had not evaluated it independently or considered it as what happens if phase two as contemplated in the Waimea Watershed Agreement didn’t occur. Again, we only heard from KAA this past Friday. What we have been doing since KAA informed us, so this is where it can get complicated. There were attempts at mediation informally among the parties to the Waimea Mediation Agreement to settle issues surrounding a lawsuit filed by Earthjustice on behalf of their clients over the adequacy of the environmental assessment prepared by KIUC for the West Kauaʻi Energy Project. There were many months of discussions, we were actively participating with the mediator in ways to address the various concerns of Earthjustice’s clients and have this project go forward. That was going forward until very late last year. We were then informed very late last year that this project was not going to go forward in its current form. There have been very preliminary discussions between KIUC and DHHL to see how an altered project could go forward that would provide water to DHHL’s lands and we’ve been participating in preliminary discussions along that. But the terms of the relationship of this stage of things to how it might affect immediate delivery of water for our lands, we were not aware of this concern from our ditch operator until Friday.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Can I follow up with Mr. Ross? You’re with ADC, Lyle? Lyle Roe, sorry. I guess I’m going to follow up with the same question that Larry is asking. Why is this only now come to a head? Has ADC been participating in these mediation discussions? Have you been aware of this?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Yeah, I’ve been in attendance for pretty much all of them, but we’ve only recently become aware of Dr. Gomez’s analysis, for me on around November 7th. I have an email here talking about it. For us, it’s sort of a new, for me anyway, it’s a bit of a new revelation.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"I’m going ask, who else has looked at that analysis? It’s sort of been put before us as given, but who’s evaluated that? Do we just believe it or what?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"I can say for ADC’s part we’re taking it seriously, but we’re sort of relying on the mechanisms of the working group and discussions with the parties including Earthjustice to vet this. We’re not asking that this application be forever gone, we’re asking for some time so that we can consider it, further evaluate it. ADC is aware probably more than anyone else of the length of time that has passed since the execution of this agreement to now. It predates my tenure here at ADC. We are aware of that, but we also want to make sure we do this right. I think this analysis...",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Who can speak for that analysis? It seems if on one hand this has been dragged out for seven years and then all of a sudden at the last minute something comes up that would sort of suspend it. Seems to me a little strange. Besides just stating that there’s this analysis done, who can explain further to us what this analysis is and what is it about and how reliable is it?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Chair, maybe if I could speak for a moment for Kekaha Ag Association. I think before getting into the technical details which if we wanted to get into that I’d rely on Basil, our hydrologist. I think the broader context from the Kekaha Ag Association perspective is when we originally evaluated the phase one changes, that was in the context of it being a temporary transitional state of affairs before the energy project would be put in place. That’s a very different context than if that remains the permanent set of modifications from then forward. Part of the way we evaluated it, was there going to be unavoidable and potentially very lengthy disruption to service in the system as a result of the construction process. When you overlay that with, we expected disruptions due to the design in the phase one modifications, but we considered that those were likely to be unavoidable in any case if phase two were being built at the time. Because you would need to do that to renovate the reservoir, to renovate sections of the ditch. That was at least our internal evaluation. From a facts-on-the-ground perspective, from a water user perspective including KAA and ADC tenants and service users, that disruption was unavoidable and probably would overlap in time. If you were going to do that, that was the time to do that. The other sort of more administrative aspect to it would be if phase two did go into effect and even originally contemplated as part of the phase one plan would be a handover of the operational responsibility to the end users from the Kekaha Agriculture Association and ADC to KIUC at some point in that process. While we had reservations about the viability of those designs in the long term, they were also going to be another party’s responsibility. That was the context in which we evaluated the phase one designs.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Mike, again, I’m also new to this but there was discussion about a working group and I have a couple of questions. Is this working group statutorily created and what is its purpose and how do the outcomes of this working group intersect with these permits that are being requested?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Dean, you want to answer that?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"If I can, the working group is we’ve initially started meeting quarterly. It’ll go maybe every two months at times, but basically it involves everybody, all the parties that were involved in the mediation agreement back from April 2017. Just to make sure that we’re moving, we’re doing our best to move forward on implementing the actions that were prescribed in the agreement.",1,B1,01/30/2024
Could you identify who the members of the working group are?,1,B1,01/30/2024
"The folks that signed on to the mediation agreement was the West Kauaʻi Watershed Alliance which Earthjustice represents, Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative, Agribusiness Development Corporation and Kekaha Agriculture Association. I think that’s everybody, if I’m missing anybody please feel free to speak up and jump in.",1,B1,01/30/2024
I don’t think it was established by statute so it’s not a Sunshine committee. Then there was a mediated settlement that you were implying?,1,B1,01/30/2024
"It’s clear that there’s a lot of background that many of us are not up to speed on, the mediation agreement and compliance. But in looking at the scope of B1 it relates to monitoring and not the actual diversions. I think a lot of the testimony seems related to B2 so I guess I was wondering maybe from testifiers given Dean’s update that actually some of those phase one monitoring actions have been taken. Dean, you said Waiakōali stream gage was installed May 2022, Kauaikinana?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"It’s not necessarily true that nothing’s been done, something was done in May 2022 and we should sort of recognize that. It’s this gap, is sort of for the completion of those monitoring infrastructures, is that correct?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"One gage was installed on Waiakōali and one on Kauaikinana, so this will provide for the installation of the remaining gages on the three streams.",1,B1,01/30/2024
Okay so I guess with that do any of those present submitting testimony...I think there’s some issues conflated in the testimony. Are there issues with the completion of the monitoring and this particular action item?,1,B1,01/30/2024
In particular I guess that’s directed to ADC and KAA.,1,B1,01/30/2024
"Well, KIUC was the applicant, ADC and KAA.",1,B1,01/30/2024
They’re the ones who are having an objection or asking for a deferral.,1,B1,01/30/2024
"Good morning, Chair. I think for our part we would prefer to treat them the same given that the phase two modifications probably aren’t going to happen or at least KIUC hasn’t committed to those. We would like to include the monitoring as part of the project just to make sure that everything with the changes to the project, everything that is going to change or possibly change with the modifications to the diversions is measured properly with those changes.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"You see them as integrated, B1 and B2. You’re asking for deferral on both of those?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"For ADC’s part, yes.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Question, Mr. Roe. Given that part of the monitoring is to understand the natural water availability, does ADC anticipate being able to access some of that surface water in the future? We don’t have data for these streams, correct? Is that true?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Dr. Strauch assisted with installation of those two gages on Waiakōali and Kawaikinana so uh we are collecting that data. I believe there is a USGS gage um on one of the streams. I don’t know if um Ayron is on the call, I don’t know if he’s able to speak to it at this point, but um yeah, we do have some data currently.",1,B1,01/30/2024
I guess my question is it seems to me we would still want to understand um these streams regardless and so it’s not wasted effort to measure and monitor them.,1,B1,01/30/2024
"Ayron Strauch with the Stream Protection and Management Branch. Kawaikinana, we have a monitoring station that measures natural flow conditions of the Kōkeʻe Ditch. On Kawaikōī, there’s a USGS gage, long-term USGS gage that is about a half-a-mile upstream of the Kōkeʻe Ditch intake. Then on Waiakoali, we’re measuring low flows in the ditch. It was the easiest, most accessible place to install the station and under low-flow conditions, 100% of the water is currently being diverted at that location because the modifications to the dam have not been made. We are gathering and we’re now at about 18 months of continuous record data, I believe if my memory serves me right, with those low-flow continuous monitoring stations. These stations were operated as partial record stations for many years by staff, as well. We have some good data for these locations, at least with the Kōkeʻe Ditch monitoring station above Kōkeʻe Stream or upstream of the proposed modifications that KIUC is planning to make for phase one. That would help us understand how much water is going into the system because there are some small tributaries that also feed the system that aren’t being monitored and there is release of water at some locations uh below the Kawaikōī and Kawaikinana intakes um that put water back in the stream. We’re not at the moment monitoring how much is being diverted in total from the system um at that location. It would at least from a monitoring and availability standpoint, adding that one ditch gaging station would make a difference. I don’t think it would affect any modifications or issues that ADC is bringing up. That’s all I had.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Dr. Strauch, have you been able to review the recent report relied upon by KAA, submitted by Basil Gomez?",1,B1,01/30/2024
I was in the field all day yesterday. I’ve not been able to in the last 24 hours.,1,B1,01/30/2024
"All of these actions are pursuant to uh the mediation agreement, the settlement agreement that all parties agreed to. When you bifurcated phase one and phase two in that agreement, was there a caveat that indicated that we would not proceed with phase one if phase two was altered? That’s in effect what’s happened, right? Phase two has been altered I want to come to that question. Secondly, whether KIUC had the unilateral right to make that decision given that they signed off on this mediation settlement.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"I can read um directly from the agreement. It says, “phase one will go into effect upon the approval of this agreement by the Commission as part of phase one. The parties agree to immediately take steps to restore flows to the maximum extent possible, for example by removing a board or lifting a gate while working on the structural modifications pursuant to the deadline set forth in section B.” Obviously we did not meet a lot of those deadlines in part due to permits and approvals that were required. Phase two says, “phase two goes into effect if and when the KIUC Energy Project goes into service.” So there was a caveat if that energy project did not proceed.",1,B1,01/30/2024
But they clearly said that there are certain things that should proceed in phase one whether or not phase two happens.,1,B1,01/30/2024
"Right, which was primarily the gaging and the implementation of the modifications to meet the instream flow standards that were established.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"It feels like that’s exactly what’s happened, that phase two may not happen but the parties understood that when they signed off on the agreement, that it might not happen.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"I’m not sure why and I get sometimes there’s new information and so forth or we have second thoughts about the agreement that we signed previously, but they did sign the agreement previously and recognize that there’s value in this data, it would be disruptive in terms of the service to install those gages and take those actions. But they committed to it and we accepted that settlement, so it feels like we’re re-trading all the hard work that went into finding that common ground. What’s the case in abandoning it at this point?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Neil, you raise a good point and I guess looking to ADC to Lyle and to Joshua to respond to that because you were part of the discussions, you were part of the settlement agreement. You also knew that phase one was separate and apart from phase two so what is the new information? It appears KIUC has decided that they’re not going to proceed, that was always a possibility given the lawsuit that was filed back in January of 2023. Why at this point in time is ADC and KAA seeing phase one as tied to phase two when that always appeared to be contemplated even under the agreement? If you could respond to that.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"I’ll jump in real quick, for our part we still support completing these phase one modifications just with some slight alterations. We don’t know what those alterations might be yet and primarily to ensure that we can supply our tenants with, and DHHL frankly, with the water that in DHHL’s case, they’re entitled to. That’s our big concern here, is the analysis that shows potentially 40 to 50% of the time that ditch will run dry in which case we won’t be able to provide DHHL with the water that they’re entitled to. At this point we don’t really know what we don’t know given the changes to the West Kauaʻi Energy Project and so all we’re doing is asking for some additional time to be able to understand what those changes are and what some of those effects might be so that they can be mitigated.",1,B1,01/30/2024
My question is similar to Dr. Kagawa-Viviani’s question. What in B1 is objectionable that may impact the water delivery in B1 which is primarily the installation of monitoring. What in B1 is objectionable to ADC?,1,B1,01/30/2024
"For our part, if the Commission were to approve this I don’t think we would have a huge problem with B1. I think it would be a little bit of a waste. We would have to go back depending on any modifications we made to B2, any modifications we made we’d want to make sure that we had the follow-up gaging to be able to verify what we had done and do that monitoring. I think it’s a case of both of these matters are tied together to the extent that we would want one to follow the other one, to complement the other so that we don’t potentially have wasted gaging or wasted effort if we’re going to make changes that aren’t currently contemplated in the applications.",1,B1,01/30/2024
Would you agree that the information that’s gathered from the data we collect pursuant to the installations in B1 would be important notwithstanding whatever changes you may have to the project in B2?,1,B1,01/30/2024
"They could be, but if I understood comments earlier by Dr. Strauch a lot of that gaging already exists except for Kōkeʻe Stream.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Ayron, would you agree with that assessment that the items in B1 you have sufficient information with the existing gages, the only additional gage you need is what’s in Kōkeʻe Stream?",1,B1,01/30/2024
At this point Commission staff were under the impression that the ditch was going to be piped over Kōkeʻe Stream and Kōkeʻe Stream’s natural flow would remain in the stream and understanding the conditions that exist in that stream. It’s a relatively small stream and we’ve tried to make flow measurements there without much success. The Kōkeʻe Stream gaging station is not a high priority. I was more referring to the Kōkeʻe Ditch before the Kōkeʻe Stream. I think it was an acoustic doppler or a pressure transducer and a new control point installed by KIUC in the ditch that was being proposed and that would help understand how much water is available in the ditch.,1,B1,01/30/2024
"One final question for me, what length of time of a deferral are you asking?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"At the moment I can’t answer that, I would hope it would be really short. The hydrologist as we mentioned in our testimony, the hydrologists both from Commission staff, Earthjustice, and KAA Dr. Gomez, they’ve already met. I can’t characterize the nature of the report because I haven’t seen it but I know that their comments have been transmitted to Earthjustice already for proposed modifications to the existing plan for phase one. It’s my understanding that Earthjustice is currently reviewing those changes.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Are you asking for 30, 60, 90 days?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"I’m not sure I’m qualified to answer that, but I would hope within 30 to 60. Again, I’m throwing a number out.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"If I’m hearing everybody correctly the intent of what we want to do, there’s alignment on that, there’s no dispute about that. Question is as we now do the work uh people are going to be inconvenienced or out of service. There could be some damages created that are certainly unintended, in some cases possibly inevitable but not intended as damage. Because the virtue of the data has a long-term value so we undergo certain inconveniences for that purpose. When we issue you or approve a permit, is it so rigid that you can’t have dialogue with the parties and figure out ways to do that to fulfill the intent of the permit which everybody agrees about, but do it in the best way possible so that the inconveniences are minimized? I mean don’t you still have latitude if we improve this permit today to do some sensible things on the ground so people aren’t hurt?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"A I think certainly for item B1 um which speaks to the gaging because certainly KIUC needs to coordinate with KAA and ADC possibly as far as what types of equipment to install because I believe the intent is that they will, once installed, they would be turning it over to KAA to manage and uh continue to maintain and report. In this case B1 I think it could proceed. I don’t know if it would hurt to defer it and come back um so that we have a better plan but I don’t think it’s so much of an issue with item B1. Item B2 is another story. I don’t know if I want to get into it too much because we’re not on the agenda item yet but um there were proposals that were developed in the modifications um based on the energy project moving forward. I can understand that there may be more um concerns moving forward on that permit.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Dean, can we hear from the applicant on item B1 as to what the impact is to ADC or KAA on that?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Aloha, thank you. First, I just wanted to clarify that for the monitoring, some of the monitoring can be done with or without the modifications. It’s independent of the modifications and other monitoring is integrally tied with the modifications because the monitoring is focused on monitoring the instream flow that is released at the point of the diversion, the amount of water that stays in the stream at the diversion. That aspect of monitoring is integrally tied so if the permit for B1 were to be issued we could do a portion of that but not all of the monitoring. I did just want to clarify that aspect. In response to the question about whether we can respond to the hydrology report or hydrology work, we have not seen it um so we can’t respond. I can say that the diversion modifications were designed to implement the phase one IIFS and they’re flexible so they can divert what’s available in the stream and they can implement the IIFS as its established in the mediation agreement.",1,B1,01/30/2024
Sort of addressing Commissioner’s earlier question of is this sort of modest tweaking or is this certain portions of the application that could not be completed as presented?,1,B1,01/30/2024
"I’m sorry, can you repeat the question?",1,B1,01/30/2024
There was an earlier question saying that do we have the ability to modify the gaging stations to make it fit as built construction kind of things? Or are you saying that they are portions of the application that cannot be completed?,1,B1,01/30/2024
"That’s correct, there are portions of the monitoring that cannot be completed without the modifications because they’re connected to the instream flow, measuring the instream flow that remains in the stream. The ditch portions of monitoring and streamflow portions of monitoring, the ditch flow Ayron named the point at Kōkeʻe Ditch before it enters Kōkeʻe Stream. That’s independent of the modifications. We could implement that portion of the monitoring but there are other monitoring points. An example is at Waiakōali stream at the diversion. There’s a measuring point there for the phase one instream flow standard that would remain in the stream. We could install equipment but that would not be able to be monitored until the modification was made because the modification itself would be the instream flow release point. I hope that makes sense.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Thank you, that certainly does add a little more clarity to what we’re talking about.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Dean, um if we approve a SCAP, there’s no obligation of the applicant to necessarily do all of it, right? We’re saying there is room for it not to be fulfilled given the sort of uncertain circumstances of KIUC’s project. Is that correct?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Yeah, you could issue a SCAP and they only complete portions of it.",1,B1,01/30/2024
We’ve already had that. I kind of want to move the discussion on to B2. I think B1 appears to be less...,1,B1,01/30/2024
"I have one more question on this. Your license or access to the site itself, how is that to be resolved, Dawn?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"The license that was spoken to earlier was a broader license that was primarily uh developed with the West Kauaʻi Energy Project moving forward. It has expired. If the permit is issued today we still have a procurement process to go through, there will still be a lead time on materials. So we have time and we would be more than happy to work with ADC on a limited right of access that would allow us to um get to the diversions and the contractor who’s going to implement the work, get to the diversions to do the work for monitoring or modifications or both. The work wouldn’t happen instantly after the permits are issued, there’s still quite a bit of lead time here before the work would go forward. We have some time to work with them.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Having said that, would it be a more reasonable approach to fine-tune your application to what work is actually to be done or can be done or should be done under phase one rather than having sort of this broad approach?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"The proposal in front of you is and was designed for the phase one IIFS, it is not related to the energy project. The license with ADC which was developed under the broader terms of West Kauaʻi Energy Project moving forward and it was developed back in 2018 but the application in front of you is specific to the phase one modifications and not the energy project.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"So it’s just principal gaging, no changes in flows?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"It’s gaging and diversion modifications that would allow the ditch operator to implement the IIFS. Some of the diversions are passive, Waiakōali is a great example. It’s very difficult to maintain the IIFS at that diversion without some kind of modification. These modifications were designed independent of the energy project to allow the ditch operator to implement the IIFS, the phase one IIFS.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"So, these hydrology reports have been issued. What’s the review time on that?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"I have not seen them. We could review them relatively quickly and we would want to review them collectively with the rest of the working group and CWRM staff. I don’t think that would take a long time to do, a couple weeks maybe.",1,B1,01/30/2024
So that is not related to phase one at all?,1,B1,01/30/2024
"If you’re speaking about the new hydrology that KAA mentioned, that KAA’s hydrologist has done, that’s new. There was significant hydrology work done through the working group, we had a hydrologist, Water Commission did their own work, each of the parties had a hydrologist. Specific to KAA’s new hydrology, we just have not seen that, but we could review it relatively quickly.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Chair, since I’m the person that did this analysis, could I clarify Dawn’s statement for a minute? This analysis is not new.",1,B1,01/30/2024
Could you introduce yourself?,1,B1,01/30/2024
"Excuse me, sorry, I’m Basil Gomez, I’m KAA’s hydrologist. I’m the person that did this analysis and I would just like to correct Dawn Huff for a second. This analysis is not new, I was asked to revisit it in November when KAA learned that the energy project was not moving forward. I presented this analysis to Commission staff at a meeting held in the CWRM conference room on the 4th of December 2015. The analysis was presented to staff at that point in time.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"I think Ayron was in that meeting. COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: When was this? CHAIR CHANG: December 2023, last month.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"I thought that was a mistake. Okay, 2015.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"The analysis existed in 2015, the parties including the party you represent signed an agreement in 2017 to do this, so why are we revisiting it?",1,B1,01/30/2024
"Yeah, that’s kind of my concern is that we as a Water Commission we’re supposed to be ensuring that the IIFS is being met and the fact that KIUC has changed their plan, that’s independent of ensuring the IIFS is being met. If there’s got to be changes to that, we still need good data. The good data is dependent upon the gages that are being part of B1. I’m ready to move on.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"I concur, there’s another reason to do it. This is not the only place where parties have different viewpoints, and we urge them to mediation, and they worked really hard in mediation. We support that. When there’s an agreement, I think it’s incumbent upon us to enforce and honor the agreement. If we start letting people retrade agreements all the time, it’s hard to move forward and we don’t incentivize mediation and coming together as a community. The intent here is still that data is very valuable for a precious resource that is highly coveted. These gages will get us that data. As we issue a permit, number one, they have a right to not do it or to do it a little bit differently to accommodate other people’s interests, I hope our approvals give you that latitude so that you could do it the best way possible. The intent of the parties, the intent of the Commission is well served by getting these gages in place, so we have reliable data to make decisions upon.",1,B1,01/30/2024
"I didn’t hear Dawn Huff on behalf of KIUC withdrawing the application. I think they also agree that there’s a distinction between B1 and B2. I also heard from ADC and in particular ADC perhaps not KAA that you were asking for some additional time but given Dawn Huff’s comments that even if we were to approve this today it would still take some time to actually install them. There is still time even within the approval process for you to continue on the discussions to review the reports and to have some input. With that being said, do I have any more questions or anybody else who we’ve not heard from that would like to make a comment?",1,B1,01/30/2024

"Approval of Stream Channel Alteration Permit (SCAP.6158.3) Application and Special Conditions, City and County of Honolulu, Board of Water Supply, Mākaha Wells II, III, and IV Access Road Repairs, Mākaha Stream, Mākaha, Oʻahu, Tax Map Key(s): (1) 8-4-030:004",1,B1,05/21/2024
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Deputy Dean Uyeno,1,B1,05/21/2024
"Staff stated the summary of request to approve Stream Channel Alteration Permit (SCAP.6158.3) by the City and County of Honolulu, Board of Water Supply (BWS). The project proposes the replacement of six (6) existing culverts with a panel truss bridge and remove rock and debris that are blocking the Mākaha Stream.",1,B1,05/21/2024
"My name is David Bills, I’m a civil engineer working in Honolulu for 40 years. I’ve done many Board of Water Supply projects and I put together the application for the stream channel alteration permit, as well as the Army Corps permit, and as well as coordinated the historic preservation aspects of the project. I don’t have anything particular to add uh except for maybe one statement. Mākaha Stream is a relatively big stream and Board of Water Supply quite often, maybe under-sizes their culverts at locations that are critical. I proposed to the Board, rather than having a culvert that would spill over and basically destroy the downstream area, that we look at a panel thrust bridge. It’s really nothing more than an old World War II bridge, but to make sure that we had three foot of freeboard from the bottom of the bridge uh to the water surface of the peak storm to make sure that that access road was available 24/7.",1,B1,05/21/2024
"Thank you, Mr. Bills. I’m actually very familiar with this particular location, having driven over it many times. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to the AIS (Archaeological Inventory Survey) and specifically the construction staging area that would be needed to carry out the work?",1,B1,05/21/2024
"Yes, well if you’re familiar with the area, you have two gates you go through down at the bottom and then basically you’re driving up an AC-paved road uh until you come up to the culvert crossing. There happens to be some area off to the left that would be available for staging, provided the appropriate archaeological uh inventory survey was done to provide clearance. If that site was not available to use as a staging area, then the contractor would have to stage at the very bottom of the road at the two gates and drive the two and a half to three miles up to the uh bridge site uh to perform their work properly. We know that that’s an issue, but we went to SHPD (State Historic Preservation Division) pretty early and asked them if this was a possibility uh and they’re still, as far as I understand, in the process of providing a clearance or making a determination at this point.",1,B1,05/21/2024
"That’s good to know that there are options, less desirable, but there are options.",1,B1,05/21/2024
Glad you added the less desirable.,1,B1,05/21/2024
"Okay, thank you for sharing that.",1,B1,05/21/2024
"I’ll be honest, I didn’t even realize there were springs, there were streams up in Mākaha. I apologize for my ignorance on that.",1,B1,05/21/2024
Are there other folks online?,1,B1,05/21/2024
"I think they were all with BWS. Did anybody else from BWS want to speak? They delegated everything to the consultant. I’ll just ask, have you spoken to community people about this? Are there any impacts of this activity on downstream activities by community members?",1,B1,05/21/2024
"There has been, as far as the consultant side goes and me as a civil engineer, uh I have not particularly talked to people except for passers-by and things of that nature. Through the archaeological process, I don’t think there’s a cultural impact study being done, but I do not know the full requirements of at least the AIS portion of the documents they’re doing in addition to the SHPD 6E.",1,B1,05/21/2024
"I know, Dean, BWS is submitting or there’s an application for uh Water Management Area right?",1,B1,05/21/2024
Is this all consistent with that plan that they’ve submitted to date or is it totally [inaudible]?,1,B1,05/21/2024
"In reviewing the submittal and then taking a closer look at the permit application specifically referencing that construction staging area, and I think as to date the consultant hasn’t contacted community, but the Board of Water Supply should. That is included in the recommendation on 1A and I want to endorse that just because Mākaha Valley is really significant archaeologically. Kāneʻaki Heiau is right at sort of the bottom of upper Mākaha and there’s a lot of intact agricultural terracing in the valley. I think it’s really important that this be done right and that’s on the Board of Water Supply who already works with I think Mōhala i Ka Wai, but maybe other groups. I would really strongly encourage some dialogue there with 1A. In addition, I wanted to propose a modification to 1D. It says, ""actions in the streambed are subject to SHPD concurrence."" I know that we are focused on water, but the construction of the stream channel alteration is going to impact a nearby agricultural terracing area. If you look at page 108 of the permit application, there is a map that shows the features that would be impacted and not being an archaeologist, I don’t know how these things work. Is it normally you just document before it gets disturbed? I think there’s an opportunity if it is going to be impacted to do some work with partners to restore it post-construction or avoid impact. Again, I know that’s not in the stream channel, but it is related to the stream channel work and I would want to be just very cognizant because of the agricultural significance of the valley to that whole region. I mean Mākaha used to be perennial, it’s fed by Kaʻala, so just to show that the Board is engaging in best practices. I had here, consider alternative staging areas, Mr. Bills said that that’s a possibility and I think engaging the community or community groups in the process of monitoring of activities and restoration as needed. The modification I just wanted to add was, it says, ""actions in the streambed are subject to SHPD concurrence."" I just wanted to add, ""actions in the streambed and necessary construction staging area are subject to SHPD concurrence.""",1,B1,05/21/2024
"This is David Bills once again. I would just like to add a little comment there. With my experience with many consultants working with me for archaeological reasons, typically State Historic Preservation Division will, so more or less, take two types of actions. 1) They will allow uh recordation of the information that was there for historical purposes. 2) If it happens to be significant enough, they will want it to not be touched or marked out and left there, notifying the community and particularly community groups interested uh in archaeological and cultural things. I would tend to agree with you that the Board of Water Supply already has a route there and might as well take advantage of it.",1,B1,05/21/2024
"I appreciate, Aurora, your comment. Sometimes we find that the staging area, pre-construction, can be even more invasive than the actual activity. I’m not sure the scope of SHPD’s review because if there’s going to be any subsurface excavation or if there’s going to be, usually they’ll have a buffer zone around known historic properties, so if there are terraces or other historic properties that should have been included in SHPD’s review. I think your proposed amendment is very appropriate. I would support the amendment. Mr. Bills, do you have any issues with that? Board of Water Supply?",1,B1,05/21/2024
"I personally don’t have any, but uh I would like Board of Water Supply to also concur.",1,B1,05/21/2024
"Hi, good morning, Michael Domion, Board of Water Supply. We concur with the amendments and we will go ahead and contact uh the possibly affected community uh and inform them of our project.",1,B1,05/21/2024
"Thank you. The leeward coast, in particular Mākaha, there are known lineal and cultural descendants from the area who may know of the...and Board of Water Supply, you have really been at the forefront of valuing community, so I would think someone like Ernie would take very seriously the whole issue of reaching out to the community, so thank you.",1,B1,05/21/2024
"Can you read the amendment? I’m a little confused about what we’re now going to be approving. Are we going to be approving with additional conditions and if so I want to know what the condition. You said with amendments, I want to know what the amendment...",1,B1,05/21/2024
"Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani I believe made the addition to uh condition 1D which is, ""actions in the streambed and necessary construction staging area are subject to SHPD concurrence if SHPD requires conditions delegate to deputy director to attach those as conditions.""",1,B1,05/21/2024
The modification was the addition of the construction staging area.,1,B1,05/21/2024
But what exactly about the staging construction area are we uh requiring?,1,B1,05/21/2024
"I think it’s subject to SHPD review to determine whether the staging area may have any impact on known historic properties. If there’s for example, lo’i, there’s walls or there’s any historic resources, but I think it’s just asking that SHPD’s concurrence be expanded to more than the streambed, but to where they may be doing construction activity that could have impacts on historic properties.",1,B1,05/21/2024
"So, when we approve this, are we approving the permit or are we holding back on the permit until we hear about them?",1,B1,05/21/2024
"You’re basically approving the permit on the condition once SHPD, State Historic Preservation Division, uh provides their letter of concurrence or any necessary actions that uh the applicant has to undertake, uh which may be certain things like uh conduct an AIS survey or certain actions.",1,B1,05/21/2024
"I think Larry we’re delegating to Dean. Once SHPD comes in with their concurrence letter, if there are conditions then that’s delegated to Dean to include it on the permit conditions. If for example, Board of Water Supply finds any of those conditions unacceptable then they can always come back to the Commission, but otherwise that would be. So, nothing stops, it’s just procedure.",1,B1,05/21/2024
That’s all I was asking whether it was going to be delegated to the staff to reach the final decision. If that’s why...,1,B1,05/21/2024

That 100 feet below sea level, I think that they can comment on the design, but the intent is not to tap into the deep confined lens or even the basal lens. The basal lens is not productive anyway and I think Keith Okamoto from the Department of Water Supply is here and he can talk about the plan stating that there should be no development of any water supplies within the basal lens. They definitely don’t want to tap into the basal lens. Drilling deep enough to tap into that deep confined lens is kind of risky and I think that it’s more appropriate that they drill it into that high level. I think they’re anticipating that that’ll be productive. Hope that answers your question.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’m Ashley Obrey, here on behalf of Hui Ola Ka Wai. We’ve been here before on this issue and I think since the outset, there have been problems with process with respect to the Ota Well. Start with Ka Paʻakai, you know this analysis really well, but for the sake of just the record, making written findings, about identifying practices, determining the impacts of this particular action on those practices, and identifying feasible action that can mitigate for those impacts. That was raised in 2021 and technically I would say that it has not yet been done because even assuming traditional and customary practices were properly identified as per the first part of the framework, how could it be complete when we don’t have a clear picture of what these impacts are? You mitigate for specific impacts. We know that the EA (environmental assessment) only assessed impacts at the wellsite and we haven’t had the chance to do any further study to understand what the impacts are. In 2021 decision-making is deferred after former Deputy Director Kaleo spent over a year talking with community, certainly Native Hawaiians. Somewhat of a compromise was reached, certain mitigation measures were deemed, quote, acceptable as conditions to the approval of Ota Well. I would say this really is a compromise because in our opinion, there are still some legal problems, but there’s a consensus in the community, we’re willing to go forward with this. Yet, on that day it was the applicants themselves who chose to seek out and request a contested case hearing based on two of these conditions which are now before you today. This was a contested case, obviously never happened and then no one heard from them for over a year. Maybe some people did, but certainly not my clients. There are discussions being had over 2023, I hear, and we didn’t hear from them until the end of January of this year. I presume we’re among the last to know about these proposals, so we asked for more information on the proposal in writing. It took a little bit understandably, but we just wanted to see what exactly is going to be proposed to you, I want to know the verbiage. We did raise concerns, we asked questions, we made suggestions. For the record, there were some objections made to these proposed modifications, but to date we’ve never gotten any response to these concerns to these questions, not even after last month’s informational briefing which we had to kind of push for them to do. Our testimony talks a little bit about the details of some concerns with respect to these modified conditions, so I don’t want to take up too much time with it. I think the bigger of the two would be the monitoring program. If Chair, you’re authorized to make the decision to approve a monitoring plan but there’s a lot that we don’t know about what this will look like, we don’t know the term, we don’t know who’s responsible for implementing it. As it stands, it just talks about the applicants initiating and designing it but nothing beyond that. How is this all going to be shared out with the community? What is a cause for concern? What are these triggers? I was hearing all this information about the AMP (adaptive management plan) and I just would like to see that integrated into this condition. In terms of metrics, what are the metrics we’re looking at? What are the actions the Water Commission is willing and able to take to mitigate any impacts that are discovered? This is the first well since this failed designation. It’s a really important step, we know there are a lot of other people waiting to see what happens today to see what happens going forward. If the wrong decision is made today, that just sets up this landslide. There’s probably a better water-related word I should say, but that’s what today is about. Re- opening these conditions just raises a host of concerns that have been exacerbated by the fact that key stakeholders were not involved in the process, at least in terms of my client. So, comes back to process. Is Ka Paʻakai complete? No. Do we understand the impacts? No. Is today’s decision-making guided by an approved water use and development plan? No. Related to that, has a sustainable yield been established that considers the decline in recharge rates and climate change and these distinct sources in Kona? No. Do the conditions as drafted meaningfully mitigate for these unknown impacts to Kona’s freshwater and coastal resources? I’m really not sure, I don’t think any of us can be. So, does this present a problem in terms of the public trust and the State’s duties? Yes, I would say it does. An agency must take the initiative in considering, protecting, advancing public rights in the resource at every stage of planning and decision-making. The Waiāhole court said that. We appreciate the staff’s work from the time of Deputy Director Manuel up until the current time. I know this is a complicated issue, I think everyone’s recognized that. You may know where I’m going, I do want the opportunity to let there be dialogue and to hear testimony from everyone. I’m happy to put my request on the record now. It’s not my job, but I would like to continue to keep the dialogue going and then maybe you abstain from decision-making. I would like to request a contested case hearing on behalf of Hui Ola Ka Wai so that there can be a more full and robust record for your consideration.",1,B2,04/16/2024
It’s my understand you’re asking for a contested case.,1,B2,04/16/2024
Are you asking that no decision be made?,1,B2,04/16/2024
Do you have an objection to us hearing all the other testifiers?,1,B2,04/16/2024
I have a few questions for you.,1,B2,04/16/2024
What are you proposing?,1,B2,04/16/2024
"If it were as easy as redlining the conditions, which I think in part we kind of tried to do.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"No, more than that. There’s been an identification, cultural practitioners have come forward expressing their concerns that we don’t know what the impact of drilling these wells are on nearshore waters. You’re saying we should wait, it’s premature, this program we don’t know enough. So what would you recommend in lieu of...are you recommending there be no further wells being drilled until and what are you proposing? How would we find that answer without doing this monitoring program? What would you recommend?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I understand that there’s a lot to be considered and the whole previous conversation about what it costs to do monitoring, I understand that there’s a lot of resources that it takes. So for me to just throw out there that that’s what you should do to start, I understand it’s not as simple as that. Obviously studies do need to happen. In an effort to kind of take a step back and think about the planning for the region again, I think we’ve talked about in the testimony. There’s the Water Resource Protection Plan to readdress sustainable yield in Kona and then moving forward to update that Water Use and Development Plan for this specific area that would take into account these groundwater dependent ecosystems and the traditional customary practices. With the proper planning because this isn’t a designated area, this process is super important . I may not have the same scientific background as the people on staff, so I don’t know that I could design anything in particular, but I think taking a step back with more of a planning in mind is very important before wells are drilled.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Under Ka Paʻakai, the third test is reasonable mitigation measures. What I’m hearing you say is because this appears to be a proposed reasonable mitigation, monitoring to determine what impact. But are you suggesting that reasonable mitigation would be no further development until all of these other measures like the Development Plan be updated? I’m trying to understand what would you consider reasonable mitigation when we don’t have sufficient information to determine the impacts?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I think that’s exactly what my concern is and maybe it’s a chicken egg thing and I can respect that, but I do feel like there really needs to be time spent on trying to understand what these impacts are as part of a planning process, as part of pulling in other experts to look at it. There was the modeling by USGS, I don’t even remember which year it is now, but there’s some information out there and it’s enough to give rise to that pause, that precautionary principle that there’s more out there to be discovered.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Would you agree that the third part of the analysis, Ka Paʻakai, reasonable mitigation, is left up to the Board? That’s the commission’s decision.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Let me ask another question. Your concern is about process and I appreciate that, me too. The process is about community engagement, did you read staff’s recommendation 1e, “to ensure better communication and coordination in the region with community, the agencies benefiting from the use of the water from Ota Well, including, not limited to NELHA, HHFDC, DHHL, and DWS shall hold an annual community meeting in Lanihau 1 and 2,” and I’m going to mispronounce, “Moeauo Ahupuaʻa to share updates on these mitigation measures and their respective projects.” Do you find that to be a reasonable process for community engagement?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I think it is a reasonable process for community engagement; however, the fact that it’s coming before really understanding...how do you make that meaningful if the decision has already been made and anything that comes out of these meetings, how do you adapt to what information comes out of these meetings? At that point the well is operational; however, many more well applications have come before you folks. We still don’t really understand what’s going on down below, down at the coast and it’s just more and more piled on top of each other and no real plan in place with what we’re going to do about it. That’s just the concern. I appreciate, there are things in here in terms of conditions and that’s why my client was agreeable to this initially was because there yes, there are really good things in here, but there’s a little bit of a conflict because I think Ka Paʻakai does specifically say, what is the effect of this action on traditional and customary practices? I think that’s the part that’s missing.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"But wouldn’t you agree even under Ka Paʻakai where we don’t know what the impacts are, that it does permit us to make reasonable mitigation measures at least to confirm or to use that as a basis to set conditions on the applicant?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Sure, you can impose conditions.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Let me read you condition 1d, “NELHA and HHFDC shall design, fund, and initiate a coastal groundwater monitoring program for Lanihau 1 and 2 Moeauo Ahupuaʻa, modeled after the land-based portion of the program currently in place at NELHA’s Host Park at Keāhole Point. The coastal groundwater monitoring plan shall be submitted within one year of the date of approval of this permit and is subject to the chairperson’s approval. This plan shall include the location of the wells, anchialine pond sampling sites. Four sampling locations shall be established, one at each of the two anchialine ponds as well as two new shallow monitoring wells. Samples shall be drawn from these locations quarterly and analyzed according to the standard procedures in NELHA’s water chemistry laboratory. Results must be reported to the Commission and shall be made publicly available on an annual basis or sooner should a given test result give cause for concern.” Do you think that’s reasonable mitigation to address some of the concerns you have about what is the modeling program, how are they going to report back to the community?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"In concept, like I said I think there is good stuff there. I think there were a lot of details that are missing that raises concerns in terms of how to give it teeth in the long term or beyond just what’s on this piece of paper. Those are the questions that were raised that we never got answers to.",1,B2,04/16/2024
And you raised them with us or with NELHA?,1,B2,04/16/2024
"With NELHA, we put it in our testimony last month and I’ve not heard anything.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I probably did this a little backwards. I [inaudible] the applicant speaks first and I forgot about them, I didn’t see them on. I will ask the applicants exactly whether they’ve answered your question or not. This is 1f, “NELHA shall submit an annual report to the Commission by December 31st of every year on how these special conditions 1a to 1e have been met.” I want to fully understand and appreciate understanding Ka Paʻakai did take into consideration reasonable mitigations to address potential impact. The question is we don’t know what impact this will have so there’s this modeling program designed to do that. What I’m hearing you say is and I don’t mean to put words in your mouth, but we should do nothing until we do these other plans before we can move forward on any. And it’s not just Ota Well, I’m assuming your concerns would be the same for anybody who comes in with a Well Construction and Pump Installation Permit along this entire coastline.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I think that’s pretty fair. It’s not Ota Well specific. Unfortunately, they’re the first to come here and this is where we are. The idea of doing nothing, I understand doesn’t sound good, but it has been a couple years since this well was first brought. There would have been time to do something. I’m not putting it on the staff per se, I’m just saying there was time.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Do you think this was something that they did, which is to meet with and I’m going to give you an opportunity to come back because I should have let the applicant speak first. We could have got an overview program, but it does appear as if from the time last year, over the last eight months at least, based upon the informational briefing, they did meet with the community, they did meet with DAR, they did meet with various entities to come up with this modeling program. It sounds like they did something during this gap period, but do you feel like it wasn’t enough or you want to hear from the applicant?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Maybe a little bit of both and I’m not looking for an answer per se, but just put it in your brains is if this were approved and this monitoring program starts to do its thing and we learn something from it, can that break be between the Ota Well and the next well? I know I’m not explaining myself right, but do you know what I mean? Is there going to be a stop gap and it’s not just like?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"[inaudible] proactive management program. If we’re finding during this monitoring program, oh my god, the impacts on nearshore or it’s the pumping is occurring. I think we could put measures within our conditions because they’re supposed to come and report to us every year and it specifically says how these special conditions have been met or sooner should test results give cause for concern. There appears to be safeguards within some of these conditions that if during this monitoring program there’s something alarming, okay, stop. We have the ability to say, okay, stop pumping, let’s find out what’s going on. But there seems to be some safeguards within the conditions to address some of the concerns that you have.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I guess on top of that, will the Commission wait to approve additional wells to see what happens here?",1,B2,04/16/2024
We’re only going to take the one before us.,1,B2,04/16/2024
But that’s the concern is just the big picture because of the unknowns and because of the complexity of it and being able to understand the big picture.,1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’m going to give you another chance to come up because I do want to, I apologize, I should have taken the applicant. With that, I do have the applicants. I have Greg Barber and Dean Minakami. Greg, do you want to go first? I apologize, I should have let you speak before I took Ashley.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’m Greg Barbour, I’m Executive Director at Natural Energy Lab and I have with me Dr. Alex Leonard, our Chief Program Officer and Mr. Jerome Kanuha is here with us. (Chair Chang leaves the meeting) He’s a lineal descendant of this ahupuaʻa and wanted to say a few words. I’ll summarize, we’ve spent quite some time talking with people to try to understand a monitoring program that would be adequate and we felt that switching from offshore to onshore was a better alternative, especially if you can develop a regional monitoring program which will help everyone understand water flows in the area and management help with management decisions. We did ask for some changes to 1a but they’re fairly straightforward, really for clarity. We support the recommendations from the staff and that’s kind of a summary of what we went over last month. If you have any questions, I’d be happy to answer, otherwise Mr. Kanuha would like to address the Commission.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Before Mr. Barbour yields to Mr. Kanuha, any questions of Mr. Barbour? Why don’t you continue with Mr. Kanuha.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Aloha, I was born in this ahupuaʻa. About three years ago, I wrote that letter to Kaleo stating that who’s going to monitor the resources that came down from that hill at the ocean because I still own the ahupuaʻa down below, but where the water comes down, Niumalu is the name of the place. Niumalu is adjacent to Lanihau, the ahupuaʻa is called Keaupū. My family had that place for 400 years, the well over there is called Puhi Springs, where as kids we used to grab the water, take home for ʻauʻau and drink water. The abundance of freshwater fish in Kailua, my question was at that time when this thing came up is, who’s going to monitor and how they’re going to monitor and make sure they take care of mauka to makai? That’s what my question was when I wrote that letter with Leimana DaMate. While reading what’s happening now, they were having hālāwai, having a lot of people putting their input into this, all these meetings, I did not go because I felt that there were too much guys in a pot, would create a hazard. In Kailua and Kona, we do need affordable homes. County needs the water, I need the water to have my house, my family live in our property. We still own 80 acres of it in that area. When I did that three years ago, I felt that it was important to realize that the water was life, it still is life, but how do we monitor if we don’t have somebody out there doing it the right way? Reading what NELHA has done and the Commissioners has recommended to do, and I think it’s the best thing for us to happen, to push this thing forward and let’s go forward. Not dwell on a lot of input from a lot of people because that’s the problem we have. I’m in support of the project, I wasn’t three years ago because they never had their ducks in place, now they do. I’m a big supporter for the Kanuha ʻohana that still own land in Kailua. I appreciate you guys listening, open your ear and listen to everybody else, what they have to say. I understand that young lady has a lot to [inaudible] in Kona, but we don’t have housing, we don’t have the water. Thank you for listening, I’ve been here a long time listening to all you guys, so mahalo and aloha. We talk to you guys later.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’ll just quickly, Chair Chang. Good morning I’m Dean Minakami, Executive Director of the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. We would like to ask for your support, conditions 1a and 1d which NELHA has been working very hard with the community to address concerns that were raised. This will allow HHFDC’s Kamakana Villages to proceed and Kamakana Villages is an affordable housing development on HHFDC-owned land. It will include about 1,600 homes, an elementary school, and commercial uses. The project is fully entitled, we have a developer on board, and it’s only the lack of potable water that is restricting the project from moving forward. I will say that we do have some concerns about the conditions. We fully support watershed management, but we see it should be recognized that HHFDC is only developing this well to provide water for affordable housing. Once the well is dedicated or once it’s built, it will be dedicated to the County so we won’t receive any revenue from this well. From our perspective, it’s just a capital expense, a very large capital expense with no revenue coming in. Our share of cost will come from our affordable housing fund. We feel that watershed management, it is in the best interest of the general public so there should be a holistic approach to funding watershed management initiatives, not placing the burden solely on those who are constructing the wells. That summarizes my testimony.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Thank you very much, Dean. Don’t worry, Dean, we’re trying to figure out a way where we can spread this cost around.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’m Keith Okamoto, Manager Chief Engineer for Department of Water Supply County of Hawaiʻi. First off, I want to mahalo Chair Chang, the Commissioners for all the hard work you guys do. I know there’s a lot of heavy lift that you guys have to deal with on a regular basis so mahalo for your guys efforts. I also want to mahalo Ryan and your staff. I think we understand as our agency is very under resourced at the moment, the challenges that your staff also faces with all the work they have to do. I wanted to put that out there first and foremost. I wanted to testify in support of this well permit application and the work that went into getting to the point where NELHA and HHFDC are where they’re at now with their proposed revisions and staffs’ recommendation for this particular well. We agree that there’s a lot of unknowns in the region, but how can we find a reasonable path forward that balances the needs of our community with the concerns of the stakeholders in the area. I have the highest respect for all those who, the practitioners, ultimate respect for Uncle Jerome Kanuha. We’ve met with him several times also. To me it carries a lot of weight with whatever comments he has as an actual lineal descendant from the region. So want of mahalo Jerome and Greg, Alex, and Dean folks on a lot of the work that they did to get to this point. We were part of those discussions. Ultimately the plan is to turn it over to the Department to operate and maintain. I think there’s the devil in the details through a lot of these conditions that I think we can figure out, but I really believe that this has presented a path forward to hopefully give us and the Commission some of the information that’s needed to help us make informed decisions for this particular well, as well as future wells in the region. And if there’s any questions for us, we’ll stick around and be ready to answer them as best we can.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Keith, can I ask you, Ashley Obrey did raise a good point about future wells. This monitoring program that’s being recommended by NELHA, HHFDC in coordination with their outreach, is this something that the water department supports for future well development in this region?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yeah, and I think she’s right. This permit right now is important because if accepted with the conditions, will set almost like the standard for future wells in the region. We think it’s very reasonable from our standpoint. Our wells that we’ll probably be bringing forward in the near future is a little bit different. Our wells that we’ll be bringing forward is to recapture some of the lost capacity that we’ve lost when we’ve repaired our wells and downsized them. Our intent is also to reduce our dependence on the wells that tap basal because just in general, we think there’s higher quality water up mauka, potentially in the deep fresh, as well. We think that will also have less impacts than pumping from basal on nearshore groundwater dependent ecosystems. I don’t have the scientific, any basis for that just my non-scientific thoughts on that.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’m even more non-scientific, but would we get some good baseline data from starting this modeling program now to better evaluate future impacts?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"That’s what we’re thinking because I think NELHA has already kind of been doing some of that more towards the north and if we monitor nearshore groundwater monitoring wells, I think we can see how if we’re pumping up mauka, if we have a baseline, if we’re monitoring some of these nearshore, onshore monitoring wells, see whatever different water quality parameters are determined. I’m guessing salinity, chlorides, conductivity all indicate the level of sea water to freshwater, I guess, proportions, set a baseline, see what happens over time with these pumping up mauka and then has been said, we can determine whether there’s actual impacts and possibly quantify them to some degree with those type of monitoring efforts. The prior recommendations, again, I don’t want to fault staff. I think they did the best that they could, but offshore monitoring, my concern is our ocean is massive. The dilution factor may not give you information that’s even worth considering if we were to monitor parameters offshore. So, when Greg and Alex proposed this onshore nearshore monitoring, that made a whole lot more sense to us, as well.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Thank you, Keith. I was wondering if Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply invests in watershed protection? I’m mostly familiar with Oʻahu and the efforts of Honolulu Board of Water Supply, but does Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply already have watershed protection programming?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yeah, we do have it programmed. We’re actually, I’m sorry to admit, we’re late to the game on that. We have budgeted annually now $100,000 for watershed protection, we’ve also recently went in and partnered with Hawaiʻi Community Foundation and our Hawaiʻi Congressional Delegation to secure, what was it Kawika for FY 24 Congressionally directed funds for watershed protection?",1,B2,04/16/2024
I believe it was an application for $1 million.,1,B2,04/16/2024
"$1 million, yeah. And what we intend to do with those funds is, I think similar to what some of the other counties are doing, is put out an RFP so that the folks who really know what they’re doing with boots on the ground can utilize those funds and put it to good use. Our criteria would be because our island is so huge and we only have water systems spread out sporadically, we’ve worked with DLNR DOFAW and UHERO to identify priority watersheds for our utility. We’d like those funds to be utilized in those priority watersheds. Thanks for that question.",1,B2,04/16/2024
So hence the interest in supporting specifically that Honuaʻula area.,1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yeah, that to me made sense, too. One of the concerns we had on the original conditions was of course the accountability, would some of the funds be used on a different island or something to that effect. This one, since there’s an existing program, again that made a lot of sense to appropriate it to that group who’s doing the good work over there.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Then given what HHFDC mentioned that they would be then turning over the well to Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply, would that cost of $13,000 a year, it seems to make sense to be part of a watershed, source water protection program. Is that something that HDWS would be welcome to shoulder?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yeah and I think we’ll probably utilize some of those funds that we’ve already set aside for our annual budgets for that effort, but just for procurement purposes, what we probably have to do is put out an RFP, something to that effect. Now, when our permits come in to this body for review and approval then maybe we can set aside specific amounts tied to that particular well permit, similar to this Ota Well permit. We would support that, as well.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Dean, we would more than welcome your participation with our DOFAW watershed protection.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’m not sure whether it’s for our staff or some of the testifiers. There’s a lot to support in this in terms of shifting a paradigm and supporting, by the way, some really worthy projects, but Ms. Obrey’s fear or concern about opening a floodgate, it’s going to open the opportunity to get more information and how long is it going to take for us to get that information so that it can inform future decisions? Well, inform the impact of the decision we’re making as well as implications for future decision making. Can we hold back the floodgate, if we open this up, are they just going to come in or do we have the time to gather and understand the information?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I was thinking about that, too as Ms. Obrey and I were having a discussion. This is a question maybe for Greg Barbour with NELHA because it appears based upon your presentation the last time, you do have information, you’ve been monitoring for quite some time. Can you confirm that or not?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yes, we have. We’re near the airport, so we’re north of the Kona town by seven miles and we have 14 ground monitoring wells here. I would say majority of them, we’ve been monitoring every three months for probably 30 years. I would say perhaps 10 of them we drilled around 2000, maybe 2005. They were more recent wells. Yes, we do that and we have that in our end report and we publish that online.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’m assuming that that’s going to be helpful information. I thought baseline would be moving forward, but you seem to have some pretty good baseline going back potentially 30 years ago to now.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yes, but I don’t know. Maybe Keith might know more about applicability to, I think we’re in a different aquifer.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"That may be true. Let me ask you Greg, Ms. Obrey indicated that she had sent some questions to NELHA on behalf of her clients. Have you guys had an opportunity to review them and respond to them?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yeah, we reviewed them and we responded to her. In terms of the details, we understand they’re not as precise as some people would like and that’s something we can work out, the finer details, but it’s really hard to do that right now. We think that taking a more incremental approach like you were talking about earlier where we would report every year, as we report every year and we have these community discussions, we could start out with a suite of parameters that we would sample for, but we can add more every year. Our position is we agree with Ryan that we should start as soon as possible a year before and we can work out those finer details as we go along to add more parameters to our testing. That’s not unreasonable and I don’t think we’ll know until we start doing it and keep moving forward, would be my feeling. A lot of her comments were not related to us and out of our control, so we couldn’t respond to those and I think we talked about those last meeting that we had in March. I want to say that we have been talking with a lot of people and there was a concern mainly with the process, with the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation that they didn’t have enough time. I think when we talked with DHHL and I think Jonathan Scheuer recommended that we request an informational briefing, first, so we could reach a broader segment of the community and we could help more people understand what we’re proposing and give it a full month to be out there in the public for review and comment. We did that. My feeling is we’ve done a lot, I’m not sure what else we can do who, we can talk to especially with the statewide informational briefing last month with your Commission and then this one again today where people can provide testimony. To be honest I’m not sure what else we can do.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Alright, thank you so much Greg. I’ve got two other people.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’m not sure, that’s another subject, but in terms of being responsive to my particular question maybe it is for Dean or staff. You’ve got their historic data from another aquifer, if we approve we’ll launch a project where we will begin data collection. How long before it can be used in a meaningful way for our decision making?",1,B2,04/16/2024
I’ll defer to Ryan on that.,1,B2,04/16/2024
"It’s going to be an iterative process and I think that’s conceptually what the adaptive management plan is looking at, is as we start to collect more data, it’s not going to be one point in time where we sort of have this paradigm shift about how we regulate, rather it’s going to be an incremental, all these little increments and steps in terms of collecting data. For example, the monitoring network that is going to be a condition of this permit will answer one part of the question. It’s not going to answer the entire question and so I think we’re going to need to look to the development of Keauhou Water Use & Development Plan and look to the adaptive management plan to start to guide us into what data we should be collecting to start answering the question. I can’t really give you a time commitment in terms of one point in time, but I can tell you that we’re going to work hard at making sure there’s an iterative process to collect better information that helps you guys make more informed decisions. I hope that answers your question.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Part of the impetus for making, approving this decision was to really fuel or contribute to the development of that process. Let me ask the question another way then, maybe going back to DWS. Do we anticipate a bunch more well proposals coming through?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"From our standpoint, we know of several. Again, we have two in progress that are primarily to recoup capacity, so it’s not really adding additional pumping strain onto the aquifer resource, it’s to replace the ones that we’ve lost. I think our permits might be a little bit different from NELHA’s and I believe Hawaiian Homes is working on one of their own for their Laʻiʻōpua project. We did get an invite to some kickoff meeting that they’ll be having this Thursday, I believe, and it’s specifically a Ka Paʻakai type event. There’s at least three additional wells that I’m aware of, possibly four. I think there’s another one that HHFDC might be working on as well. I defer to Dean on that one in this particular region. Again, we’re committed to stay south, more south and stay higher level. Even with those who intend to turn wells over to us, we’re telling them we’re not going to accept the well that’s drilled into the basal aquifer, at this point. We’re not going to accept, that’s the big one because we think that one would have the greatest potential to impact the nearshore groundwater dependent ecosystems and potentially cultural practices.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I have a question, a bit of a follow up for Ryan. Specifically we’re talking a lot about adaptive management but that AMP was drafted and I mean according to your own notes in like 2018. What’s the status on it and when can we expect to see it? It seems premature to develop a monitoring plan when there’s actually a scoping, good information to use to inform that plan. We’re putting the cart before the horse a little bit.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I think Katie’s here, she might better be able to answer that question. We did provide comments on the Adaptive Management Plan and sent it back over to National Park Service. I don’t know if Katie wanted to expand on that a little more?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Aloha Chair, Commissioners, Katie Roth of the Planning Branch. The Adaptive Management Plan is still in draft form. It’s been something that the Planning Branch was tasked with trying to complete when I came on board about two years ago now. I have been on maternity leave the last six months, so that’s definitely put a wrinkle in plans to continue work on that plan. As Ryan mentioned, we’ve been communicating with NPS and there’s been some back and forth. There does need to be a lot more work on it in terms of developing what that monitoring component looks like. We’ve been soliciting input internally from Commission staff and what that needs to look like, but I think at this point we need to kind of broaden the scope. I’ve also been thinking about how that Adaptive Management Plan which is intended for the Kaloko-Honokōhau region intersects with the Keauhou Water Use and Development planning process, intersects with our Hāpuna deep monitor well that we’re proposing to drill. There’s a lot happening in this region so I’m trying to figure out how we put all those pieces together to come up with a more holistic, comprehensive understanding and path forward in terms of our planning processes because there’s a lot of plans happening and I want to make sure that they’re all communicating and working collaboratively together.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"How well developed is it in terms of assessing groundwater dependent ecosystems and traditional customary practices? My understanding and this has been a lot in the last couple days for me to catch up on years of dialogues, but that National Park Service was initiated as a cultural historic park and so they have a vested interest in more than just damsel-flies. They have a lot of knowledge that we should be drawing on even if it’s not Lanihau and if we’re not incorporating that or having some dialogue with what NELHA is planning, it’s a lost opportunity.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Absolutely, Jonathan actually pointed it out to me a few days ago. There is an analysis that was done on impacts to traditional and customary practices in that region, the extent to which that is incorporated in the current Adaptive Management Plan, I need to take a look. When Kaleo was here, we also discussed trying to partner with folks at the University of Hawaii to fund research regarding implications and impacts of water resource development on GDEs or groundwater dependent ecosystems. That hasn’t gone anywhere, unfortunately, due to funding restrictions, but that’s also part of the conversation. How do we get funding to support the research that’s actually needed to answer some of these larger questions.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Final question is sort of both for Ryan and Katie. How familiar are you with the recent publications by say Britney Okuhata and a number of people doing isotope work in Kona because there’s actually a bunch of information out there on the connectivity between high level and basal. They’re looking at 30 to 70% of basal coming from high-level based on isotope analyses. I’m not seeing that addressed here. I was kind of going to wait, but I was like okay, I have my list.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I can speak for myself, I have not looked at that research in detail, although I have had ongoing conversations over the last year with folks at UH, Leah Bremer, the folks who are actually involved and thinking more about groundwater dependent ecosystem impacts.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"There are different realms. There’s the groundwater dependent ecosystems work, folks looking at the coast, but then there’s the geochemist and earth sciences and they have studies that go back to Tillman, Fackrell, many students of Craig Glenn’s that have worked in Kona. I highly, highly recommend that that be included because if you’re going to launch, and this is my academic side, if you’re going to launch on a study, you have to do a thorough literature review, otherwise you’re just making stuff up on the fly. I think that’s not us, on the Commission, doing our due diligence. There’s a lot of information I didn’t know until I started poking around last night and we really owe it to ourselves. This is a precedent-setting permit to cite and include those resources and include an assessment of NELHA’s baseline data and really pull together some of this regional knowledge there is...it is there. Then the other thing is if there are dialogues, and it’s not for you, it’s maybe for the applicant, you’ve had these dialogues so you have senses of what people are concerned about. These are called biocultural indicators. Those are beyond measuring chloride, salinity, temperature and are really important for linking the physical processes and biological processes and those cultural values that shape management. I think this is a really good opportunity to do a solid job because of the attention that the ‘Ike Wai Project had put and we should be harnessing that. I’ll try to put all my files and push them to you guys.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"If I can add that condition 4 of the original permit approval required a tracer isotope study to look at differences between different seasons and in determining flow direction from the Ota Well, that high level area and the basal lens. It is a condition of the permit to further the research that UH did and I think that’s a good first step. Maybe that can be done in conjunction with the UH research to provide...",1,B2,04/16/2024
"There is research that’s already been published, Ryan. It’s been published. We should in our staff submittal we should be citing it, that’s what I’m saying, to show that we are doing our due diligence in evaluating the permit. Anyways, we can go on.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Aloha Chair Chang and the Commission on Water Resource Management. I am Wendy Laros, I’m the president and CEO of the Kona-Kohala Chamber of Commerce. Since our establishment in 1968, our organization has worked to enhance the quality of life for our community through a strong sustainable economy on Hawaiʻi Island. We have over 460 members, those are businesses and organizations. We are the fourth largest chamber in the State. Our mission is to provide leadership and advocacy for a successful business environment in West Hawaiʻi. Water development and housing are top priorities for the Kona-Kohala Chamber. We strongly support freshwater resource development, maintenance, protection in West Hawaiʻi. We encourage streamlining government regulation to provide predictability for development and we support housing projects at all inventory levels and the necessary infrastructure to develop more housing. The development of the Ota Well in West Hawaiʻi aligns with our priorities and we strongly support this project. We urge the Commission to approve the recommendations provided by the CWRM staff and work with the permit applicants to move forward. It’s already been said, you know what the results are, but 2,330 housing units in Kona will be a game changer. The Kamakana Villages at Keahuʻolu are very important to this community, so we really want to see that move forward. Natural Energy Lab of Hawaii Authority, NELHA, they’ll receive water credits to complete the buildout of the Hawaiʻi Ocean Science and Technology Park and it’s very important what they’re doing there with research, education, and innovative commercial activities that provide economic diversity to our region which is primarily tourism. These are very important projects, we’d really like to see this move forward. We are confident that the benefits of this new water source will significantly contribute to the well-being of the community and we appreciate the Commission’s attention to this important West Hawaiʻi water resource and look forward to a positive outcome. Mahalo for the opportunity to testify.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Thank you, Chair Chang, and aloha to the rest of the Commissioners there. I wasn’t planning on testifying, just available for questions simply because I do have a lot of background on these issues. But after listening to all the testimony, I did want to make a few comments just to share what little manaʻo I have working with the Commission since its inception in 1987. I think after listening to everything today, obviously there’s lots of unknowns. There’s concerns of connectivity at the high level, Ka Paʻakai, concerns of the practitioners, the needs of the community, all these competing things. When I saw the recommendations, I thought they look pretty good, but these lingering pieces of these unknowns that are still kind of in the way. You have a contested case request in front of you today, as well, but today is really a culmination of something that started back in 2007. 17 years ago when Jerry Bell called me when I was head of the Groundwater Regulation Branch, she was the superintendent at the national park and she was asking how to help with the concerns of the national park with all the wells that were going above and nearby the national park and how they would affect it. Then there was a whole length of round tables done by the Park, by the Department of Water Supply. So, there’s a lot of information. There’s also a lot of information with NELHA offshore. A lot of that stuff went into the designation that finally resulted in a no designation because the Commission felt that the aquifer wasn’t threatened. A lot of talk about GDE and offshore things, that’s kind of a separate thing, I think. What you have in your submittal and what was kind of going forward before I left the Water Commission was a bunch of things to help try and mitigate that particular concern. GDE, groundwater dependent ecosystems, there are things in the Water Use and Development Plan, drilling south of the QLT Well which this Ota Well is doing and following that draft plan. No more drilling in the basal, another mitigative step to address these GDEs because we don’t know what’s complex. There’s a lot of new literature that’s out there as Commissioner Viviani has pointed out, these bioindicators, how do you amalgamate all these things together? I know that staff, when I was there, we had the Symposium 1 which basically was trying to get the science part together with the practitioner part, the native knowledge. It seemed like a pretty good thing, although there weren’t triggers or a plan on what to do with this information, which is why there was supposed to be this Symposium 2. It’s even mentioned in your submittal and it was the April 2021 right before I left that there was going to be this Symposium 2 and some plan in doing this to get those people at the table conversing about this. It was nice to see Greg Barbour and NELHA sitting at the same table with Mr. Jerome Kanuha. That’s kind of a mini symposium in my opinion, but it needs to be a bit broader with more of the scientists, more of the guys who have years and years of experience on both the practitioner side and on the scientific side. I think that Adaptive Management Plan, Ryan answered the question rather well. That’s supposed to be one of the offspring of a symposium as well as all the parts for that Adaptive Management Plan. You have these monitoring questions, okay, what exactly do you have to look at? Watershed protection, well that’s part of Adaptive Management Plan, I would imagine. Offshore monitoring, that’s another thing. All to get at this issue about GDEs and the concerns of the practitioners and people who are concerned about the ocean. Anyway, long story short, my comment would be try to reconsider that Symposium 2 to make it a little bit broader for everyone involved for the community and with the goal in mind of trying to come up with this Adaptive Management Plan. But in the meantime, things can move forward because I think the resource itself, the aquifer, is not threatened. It’s the things that we’re using that aquifer for, seem to be the concern. Anyway, that’s my comment and really I guess a question, what happened to the Symposium 2 that this Commission required? I think that’s still in limbo, I don’t know if it’s going to move forward. Thank you.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Aloha mai kākou, members of the Commission. For the record, my name is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer, here today on behalf of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, though I do have over a decade under my belt dealing with North Kona water issues and other capacities, as well. I want to start off my remarks, I feel the energy in Greg’s voice when he’s testifying about how long he’s been waiting for this and there’s lots of energy and lots of time that have been spent on this permit and other issues and I think it’s sort of some of the emotional content of what we’re struggling with here and what you guys are ultimately struggling with. It’s been years since they first applied for a well in an undesignated area and yet they’re still waiting for a permit. I know many community members have been waiting for even longer since 2017, the Water Commission denied designation in part on the adoption of a final Keauhou Water Use and Development Plan that has not been done, as well. Even before that, and I was glad that Roy mentioned the meeting with Jerry Bell because I was going to mention it, too, the concerns that Kaloko Honokōhau National Historical Park started when pumping was way less in this area, started in 2007. Actually, the request from Jerry Bell was like, hey, we understand there’s this mechanism called designation that actually empowers the Water Commission to put conditions on permits and consider impacts and consider the location and pumping levels of wells and the response from staff at the time was, no, actually you should just get together and talk story with people about it which led to the creation of the Kona Water Round Table which did generate some dialogue, but not necessarily any meaningful framework for making decisions and protecting traditional and customary processes. Of course, sitting here for DHHL, we have beneficiaries who’ve waited this century for the promise that was accepted by the State of Hawaiʻi at statehood to deliver homesteads and water is a major barrier for us developing homesteads. You have written testimony that we submitted to you signed by Kali Watson. We cited two main interests that we have in this particular well. We are, thanks to the agreement of HHFDC and NELHA, going to get a small portion of water from this well for homesteading if this goes through. Because of that, we want to see the well go through in as expeditiously and responsible manner as possible. The second concern mentioned in our written testimony it’s like if there are things that would lead to a legitimate contested case hearing, that would lead to a legitimate delay of this process, we’d much rather have you take the time needed to address those things. Listening to the testimony from Ms. Obrey and some of the comments, is there known data about the impacts of well development in North Kona that’s in your possession that were not even considered in the staff submittal? Katie mentioned it and I’m only talking about this because I wrote it, the Water Commission specifically asked during the designation process for a report on traditional and customary practices at Kaloko Honokōhau, as well as a report from the National Park Service on what they thought the impact would be on more wells. It’s not mentioned in the submittal, but it’s on the Commission website, it’s in your possession, and it’s not referenced at all in the thing. Are there things in your possession, is there research in your possession that’s not referenced? Can you make even the first finding on Ka Paʻakai, the scope of traditional and customary practices, relying on an applicant’s outreach solely when you have some people saying, hey, we weren’t outreached to in the process. Can you get to the third part of Ka Paʻakai without relying on somebody who’s challenging the first part of Ka Paʻakai. This really gets to and we, DHHL, it was mentioned by Keith, one well. We actually have two wells that DHHL is pursuing because working with the Hawaiʻi County Department of Water Supply, we need at least two wells to develop all the lands that we have in Kona. One is towards Keauhou in partnership with Kamehameha Schools, one is on a private property a little bit farther north but not super far north in the aquifer. I appreciated Keith’s mentioning we have a first meeting this Thursday in Keauhou trying to cast, actually not a selected thing but as broad as possible to practitioners like, hey, we’re developing water sources here, we want to hear from everybody who might be willing to talk to us, we have consultants who are helping us do that. We’re going to do our part, but I think that we will really need your help as the Commission. In the sense, what I’m talking about is that doing a Ka Paʻakai analysis without the Hawaiʻi Water Plan really, fully updated and meaningfully in place is really hard because the Hawaiʻi Water Plan and particularly the Water Resource Protection Plan, which is your guys kuleana and adoption of the Water Use and Development Plan for Keauhou, which is the County’s kuleana, after and then gets approved by you, gives the framework for looking at not well by well impacts, but regional impacts. Of course it’s a single aquifer, so you can’t say that this well is just going to affect this area. It’s going to affect this area more but you manage it as a single aquifer because you’ve made the decision as a Commission that this is an interconnected water body. Particularly for the Water Resource Protection Plan, we all know and it’s been alluded to in the staff submittal, there’s this so-called high level water body which is really a slightly confined portion of the basal water body, inland. There’s the basal lens, thin, shallow, very subject to over pumping, already significantly over pumped in some areas and then there’s this deep confined ground water, fresh, below saltwater which has some level of connection and we have some data on it. But the Water Resource Protection Plan that is in place literally assumes it’s all basal aquifer and sustainable yield is based on that. Particularly for wells in the high level and especially for the pending wells that people are thinking about putting into the deep confined water, people are going to try and say well we’re going to take this much of sustainable yield, but is that overall sustainable yield for the aquifer really just applicable to this small deep confined area? Really, I think the job that the Water Commission has is update the Water Resource Protection Plan, talk about how these are three separate parts somewhat connected, somewhat disconnected from each other, probably adopt different sustainable yields for each of those which you could then start to assess impacts of development of those things. Then, it would be really a good time for the County to develop the Keauhou Water Use and Development Plan because if they try and update it now without having an updated Water Resource Protection Plan, all they have to do is they have to write it in compliance with the Water Resource Protection Plan. If the Water Resource Protection Plan says it’s all a basal aquifer, that’s pretty hard for them to do and if you go through these steps, then you can actually get to, okay, in the context of overall protection of the resource in this area, how do we think about the impacts of this particular well? Whether it’s our wells coming up, whether it’s this well or whether it’s other wells that are coming up. It’s really I think the kuleana you guys have and the concern I have is that there has been a lot of conversation since 2007 and before, but there is this pattern of we’ll get to it, we’ll get to it. We’ll get to it, but we got to get through this thing now. We’ll get to it, we’ll get to it, but at what point does this Commission say, okay, we got to get to it because it’s jamming everybody up on this back end when they’re just trying to develop a project. My list, by the way of things I’ve seen in documents, there’s at least 14 pending wells in Keauhou, 12 of which are production wells which include wells proposed for the basal, the high level, and the deep confined. It’s not a small amount. I’d be happy to answer any questions.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Can I ask you and I greatly appreciate your testimony and the articulation. I just want to confirm, is your testimony that until CWRM adopts the Water Resource Protection Plan one, two and then the County adopts the Water Development Plan, that no further well should be developed in this aquifer?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"That is not my testimony, to be clear. Water Resource Protection Plan was adopted in 2019, there were concerns at that time that it was not reflecting these water resources. The Keauhou Water Use and Development Plan was partially adopted in 2017, but never confirmed by the County Council. That’s seven years now. Since then, the Water Resource Protection Plan is already overdue. I think there should be some focus and attention paid by this body to updating those so that not every well coming up suffers from, oh, do you want us to wait till those are done? The Department’s testimony specifically on this well is regarding the concerns raised by NHLC (Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation). We don’t want to see this go into contested case, it will harm us as well as the well applicants and there’s been, from what we’ve heard, some concerns about whether or not Ka Paʻakai is complied with. I’m talking to you both about specific comments on this and the overall context that we’re facing here.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I don’t want to misrepresent, so what is your position? From DHHL’s perspective, can the Commission approve this well?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"What our testimony is, to state it again what’s in our written testimony, we’re encouraging you to be very deliberate in determining whether or not the concerns that have been raised by NHLC regarding compliance with Ka Paʻakai, including the things I mentioned like do you have evidence in the record, your own possession that’s not being considered?",1,B2,04/16/2024
On the existence of impacts from further water development in this area and traditional and customary...,1,B2,04/16/2024
And you’re referring to [inaudible]...,1,B2,04/16/2024
"Among other things as well as scientific information that has been published about the interconnection between high level, deep confined, and basil groundwater. Do you have that evidence, do you have information on the record that you’re not considering? To me, that would be if I was sitting in your shoes like, oh, wait we want to make sure if we’re making, you have your information from the applicant, but then you have to make your own independent findings on Ka Paʻakai, right?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Based upon the report that you’re familiar with and what you’ve just cited, what did those findings provide us if we had them before us? What would they tell us with respect to this particular well?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"With respect to this particular well, I was familiar with, so just again to be really clear, I’m here on behalf of DHHL. I prepared those reports when I was working for a former client which I no longer work for. I’m not representing the National Park Service, I’m here representing the DHHL, but you’re asking about my former work with the National Park Service. Those reports included one report from a National Park Service hydrologist which concluded that based on all the available evidence they had including on biological indicators in the park that if you maintained existing levels of withdrawals that impact the park, the park would be okay. But if you go beyond those, if you do additional water development, they would expect to see significant harm.",1,B2,04/16/2024
Significant harm specifically to?,1,B2,04/16/2024
"Again, not one of the pair of reports that was requested by the Commission that I prepared, so now I’m digging into my memory and they are in your possession. It was by Dr. Paula Cutillo. One of the things had to do with the salinity impacts on the nymph stage of a federally listed, endangered damselfly that the non- scientific description is like, there’s a goldilocks zone for it. If the anchialine pool is too salty, it cannot reproduce or mature to adulthood. If it’s too fresh it cannot...it has this happy median. There were things about limu and the juvenile stages of water birds that actually require certain access to fresh water before they fledge, if I recall correctly. Then a report that I did along with Dr. Bianca Isaki looked at historic, existing, and planned future traditional and customary practices at the park, including practices related to some of the resources referenced in the first report. But again, just to be really clear you’re asking me about work that I did and DHHL’s position is that we just want you to be thorough in your decision-making so that there’s not a successful contested case, so that this well can go forward.",1,B2,04/16/2024
It’s very difficult to distinguish because you are relying upon those previous...,1,B2,04/16/2024
It’s part of your record.,1,B2,04/16/2024
"Thank you, Ashley here. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify a couple things. To be clear, the Water Commission should not be able to adopt mitigation measures before impacts are properly considered and assessed. Chair, you asked if it’s okay to add these conditions when there may be an unclear picture of impacts and I think more conditions are always better and I think that’s where my agreement was, but the bottom line of the argument is that mitigation is meant to address specific impacts. We have to study them, you have to analyze them, and asking if monitoring is an appropriate mitigation measure assumes that you know what you’re mitigating for. It’s a hard question to answer from where I’m sitting, but ultimately Ka Paʻakai cannot be completed without that. I think this has been said already, so I can skip through it more quickly, but the Ka Paʻakai analysis obviously didn’t address that National Park Service report that identified traditional and customary practices and other reports and studies in the record that could have contributed to some of the analysis of impacts which would be important to Ka Paʻakai. That’s the one issue and then the second issue, let’s assume we can get to this mitigation, our other point was that as drafted, these conditions aren’t crafted in a way that really allow you to do your job in order to really understand the situation and understand how to make it meaningful. The triggers can’t really be based on feelings, a feeling of being concerned. I think there needs to be something more solid. The County admitted this is the start and I think Jonathan added to it with what other wells are coming online, but this is the precedential thing. This is setting the standard for what’s to come in Kona and stepping back as I mentioned as Jonathan just mentioned, there are all these plans that you’re obligated to do to ensure that your decision-making is consistent with the Water Code and with all the different factors you’re supposed to consider when making these decisions. And this goes beyond Ka Paʻakai, so that still exists even outside of the Ka Paʻakai issue. I think just ultimately Hui Ola Ka Wai felt left out of the process, we had concerns, we were basically asked to bring them here because they weren’t answered and I’m still a little baffled as to why some of the questions weren’t answered because they weren’t really complicated, I don’t think. But here we are and I appreciate not wanting to be the bad guy that holds things up, that’s not the intention. I live in that community, this stuff is important to me personally, as well. I think things got to be done right, that’s where things always go wrong. The process isn’t followed and something that could have been good for a community and I’m not saying whether or not this particular well is good but doesn’t get a chance to go because things weren’t followed properly. I think that’s it unless you have any questions.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I have a question. Would you agree that Ka Paʻakai is personal? That a person who is asserting traditional and customary practice that you have to prove that you are being impacted by this project, but it’s not just any Native Hawaiian. I couldn’t be someone from Molokaʻi coming over to Keauhou saying, oh, I have a traditional and customary practice there. You have to establish how this particular project impacts your traditional and customary practice. That’s how I read Ka Paʻakai. Do you read it differently that it is broader?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I mean Ka Paʻakai as a framework an agency must follow to make decisions, I see that as separate from whether someone has a valid practice.",1,B2,04/16/2024
Are you asking if somebody needs to be a lineal descendant?,1,B2,04/16/2024
"No, as I read Ka Paʻakai in the Constitutional obligation, it says that you have to establish that you personally or you are descendant from someone who has traditionally customarily practiced in this particular area that’s being impacted by the proposed project. That’s how I read Ka Paʻakai. Do you read it that any Hawaiian can come and say, I’m being impacted by this? I’d like to understand your client, their connection to place and what impact are they asserting is being or what traditional and customary practice are they asserting is being impacted by this particular well construction?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I have to go back to where I was going earlier to say that how Ka Paʻakai is a framework for an agency and I understand what you’re saying, I think you’re talking about like standing and maybe I’m muddying things in my mind. But Ka Paʻakai, it’s just whether or not an agency went through that process. Did you identify these practices and these resources in an area? Did you identify the impacts that will likely occur from this planned action and have you considered what action you can take to mitigate those impacts? That’s one thing, claiming you have a traditional and customary practice that is being affected, it’s obviously related because that’s an impact that’s someone that’s been spoken to, but it’s a separate, it’s a different obligation.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I see the law differently, I see our constitutional obligation based upon the same analysis that as an agency we are required to go through that analysis so the facts that were presented at least by ʻAha Moku at the time of the 2022, the hālāwai and the requests that came in. You’re requesting here today this contested case based upon your client’s impacts. As I read Ka Paʻakai, if we go back and we look from the point of the original case, I want to say Kapuniai, but not Kapuniai, Hustus versus. First, we started from you have to live in that that ahupuaʻa, you have to be a descendant and then the court said, no you can be brought. But even under Pele Defense Fund, you have to show that you practice. It may not have been from [inaudible], but your practice and they did substantiate that they practice, even if they are from Molokaʻi, they practice the religious practice. In my mind when I look at that constitutional obligation and the line of cases, you still have to have a traditional and customary practice to place that has to be impacted. Traditional Hawaiians that at least the way that I was raised, it’s mahaʻoi if I’m from Kāneʻohe, I do not go to Kona and say, okay my family. I’m trying to understand what is the practice, what’s being impacted, how are your clients being impacted by this particular?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"That’s fair. Our client, and I’m sorry if I didn’t make that clear earlier. I think in previous testimonies we’ve talked about it, but Hui Ola Ka Wai has maybe about 20 to 30 odd members including ‘ohana. It spans people who are fishermen, gatherers, kiaʻi lokoiʻa, so there’s a good majority that works at Kaloko Fish Pond on the National Park Service property and they exercise traditional and customary rights along the shoreline and particularly at the fish pond, as well. Some individuals that are part of the hui were among the people that former Deputy Kaleo Manuel talked with in the first go-around of Ka Paʻakai. If that’s the point we’re trying to get at, yeah, it definitely goes without saying they have an interest in terms of their rights being affected by any decision.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’m trying to understand it, are your clients, is their assertion that pumping this well is going to affect their ability to continue to gather?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yes, but the assertion is in specific legal issues is that Ka Paʻakai hasn’t been complied with, that there’s issues with upholding duties to the public trust, for failure to study the impacts and understand the impacts, not being guided by these plans that should be in place prior to decision making.",1,B2,04/16/2024
Are you saying that we have to make an exhaustive research?,1,B2,04/16/2024
"May I make a suggestion? One thing I noticed in reading this submittal was I compared 1d from its original form and its current proposed form and the big difference between those two, I think there’s a lot of merit in switching the monitoring from offshore to onshore. I think we can all agree, but one thing that got lost was this consultation. There’s that very first sentence of 1d in its prior form and I think it’s important to preserve that. I think that’s maybe what Ashley Obrey is speaking to is that actually if you look at 1, I can read 1d in its original form and I think it’s important. I was going to make a suggestion that we put it back in and also because NELHA has already sort of engaged with it. We just need more...",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Because that was my understanding of what we had asked them to do, at least I had asked them to do is you need to do consultation, not the Water Commission, but NELHA has to do that consultation.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"But read the terms, so 1d as proposed is “NELHA and HHFDC shall design, fund, initiate coastal groundwater monitoring program”...But the initial started as “working with practitioners and ʻohana to determine what resources to inventory and in coordination with DAR to avoid duplicative efforts, the applicant shall fund, design, implement...” I think the loss, even though they engaged in it, the loss of that sort of erases well one, that’s our documentation. If we adopt 1d as proposed in this submittal, someone reading this two years down the line will say, oh, well you know this is the template, we don’t have to consult. What I’m saying is I think preserving that and then it’s going to ask, I was going to ask for a deferral so we could do a little bit more homework and they met with many people. Can we get letters of support that demonstrate that they do have the support they claim they have and mostly, basically to show that we are asking our applicants to do what they need to and that we’ve done our homework, that they’ve met these benchmarks because they have done it but are not showing it on our records.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"You’re right, there hasn’t been good administrative documentation. My recollection is that when they came to us last month, they said they had met with 75 ʻohana, organizations and I did ask and had encouraged staff and NELHA to include that as part of the record because you’re right, the record as was submitted, there’s just a few testimonies. In my mind that’s what I thought they were doing, they were consulting. Again, I’m wondering what is, I am in no way going to in any way dismiss Ashley and her clients because they come forward with legitimate concerns and she participated, but how far are we required? Because we’re not doing the consultation, we have to build our record based upon what they submit to us.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Right, we can ask them to submit documentation and especially if a stakeholder or community member doesn’t feel consulted, if we can help facilitate that. And the reason is, I think we can have a better monitoring program because of it. I’m doing this right now, I’m scoping ʻEwa. I’m being like, you’re in this pūnāwai, what do you care about? I care about the fish, I care about the ʻōpaeʻula, I care about this, and they all care about different things. Those are bioindicators that when they see the fish going down, they know something’s happening up mauka. I’m bringing this up, it really speaks to the broader issues of a lot of our addressing of traditional and customary practices seems to be very surface water focused. Kona is 100% groundwater and we as a Commission need to do better at understanding and we are behind, but we can catch up as fast as we can. This is not just an us thing, it’s groundwater management everywhere. What we don’t see is really hard to manage, but I think with kiaʻi lokoiʻa and a current practice of kilo, I mean basically NELHA’s engaged in kilo with sensors. This is what I do in a professional setting, but what else can we learn from watching the organisms that in my mind are integrated biosensors? They integrate information on what species limu is growing and when that limu changes, the fish go away because their food isn’t there. We can have better science and the hard part is I’m an ecologist, but I’m also a hydrologist and I know these guys speak different languages. We do need to sit down together and kind of work through what’s called the grown zone of not understanding each other because I’m very hopeful that if we can get through that part, we’ll have a much better system. Communities don’t have money to put sensors in with $1000, $10,000 loggers, but what if we partner? Folks who maybe have been here for two years or 10 years don’t know what folks who’ve been here for generations know about the resource, so how can we not go into more conflict but use this as an opportunity to really try and understand those different perspectives and get them together. For me, it’s what are those things that we should be kilo-ing and watching and what’s the frequency? When I design a study, this is like Red Hill, you monitor monthly, you’re going to miss that [inaudible]. What is the frequency of change? Some things if you worry about PCBs and sediment, they’re not going to change, monitor once a year. Other things like flows or I don’t know, nitrates, you’re going to have to measure more frequently and then when you see something collapsed, you know it’s because this happened or that happened, the spring went down because they were pounding piles for the rail. They have information that is very useful for us to use as management. I don’t think we’ve been tapping it, maybe this is an opportunity. Sorry, I’m heated because this is stuff I really care about and I think it’s also an imperative for us on the Commission to, groundwater is really hard, but I think especially because it comes up on Maui and Hawaiʻi Island. Our younger islands are very porous, you don’t have the luxuries of caprock as much and so it’s going to require different way of doing things.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’m trying to figure out a process. I got a request for contested case hearing, but I’m also hearing from Commissioner Aurora a potential recommendation that may address some of your concerns. Because we can’t even entertain a motion if there’s a contested case hearing and you can always request a contested case hearing so long as it’s before the close of the meeting. It is up to you, but would you consider withdrawing your contested case, let’s see what Commissioner Viviani comes up with, and then you can decide. Or you can still do your contested case and we can at this point in time after the last, you’ll be the last, we can take no action. Sorry to put you in the position, but she may be able to address both Jonathan as well as yours. She may or may not, but she’s trying to come up with...",1,B2,04/16/2024
"It’s worth a try, I’ll take a shot. I won’t take it personally.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"If it avoids and gets us closer, it’s worthy of trying. Up to you, Ashley. I will leave that up to you.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’ll say that I don’t think of a contested case hearing as having to be contentious or anything bad. I understand the not wanting to hold up the process and so I respect that as well. I’m happy to hear it, but my clients have sort of made a decision about wanting to make sure that the best information is before the Commission, but I don’t think it’s a bad thing to hear ideas because it’s only going to make a record that you guys can maybe utilize in another meeting for another time, too.",1,B2,04/16/2024
You tell me what you want to do because what you decide to do may dictate what we do next.,1,B2,04/16/2024
"I’m happy to withdraw it briefly to hear this but knowing that I’m going to bring it right back after the close of her discussion, so I don’t know if that’s worth the Commission’s time.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I think it’s still worthy to hear what the Commissioners may be suggesting as it may create a path forward for your consideration. I am in no way telling you not to if you still feel like that’s what your client requested, then you have to do what your client requested. So am I hearing your willingness to withdraw your contested case, let’s hear what Commissioner has to say, and then you can decide what you want to do?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"My need for a biological break, giver her five more minutes to revise.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I guess in my assessment of this submittal and the testimony and the knowledge I have gained in the last week about Ota Well and the broader context of Keauhou’s, I’ll just say, failed or non-designation, I think it would be helpful for this applicant to do several things and for staff to do several things to help us ensure we’re making an informed and well supported decision. Because this is precedent setting, it will be scrutinized, etc. NELHA already has important baseline data, I think having as an addendum or I don’t know the formal legal language, but having as an addendum a summary of their information to date of observations and trends would be very helpful documentation. From NELHA and HHFDC, letters of support from the community consulted and maybe a template but also maybe their specific suggestions of reflecting the conversations that the applicant has had with their 75 to 100 folks connected with. I think that will demonstrate that the outreach was effective and that there is broader support, especially if it can speak to the traditional and customary practices that we need to make sure are addressed as part of our mandate. Then the proposed details and maybe it’s framed and written in a way that it’s not committing them, but proposed details of monitoring. They’ve done this a little bit, they’ve indicated two sites, but a little bit more detail since they have done consultation on the metrics whether it’s physical, they spoke to the physical and chemical, they did not really speak to the biological [metrics] or in any detail. So give us more details on that and especially the sampling frequency for each of those. I propose if they can develop their vision for what that monitoring could be done, what could be done in collaboration, as what I call community science or citizen science, that would be really compelling. Then on the staff side, I think we need to provide ourselves a more rigorous summary of the published information, specifically three things and then a fourth item. 1) The current state of knowledge regarding the hydrogeology of Kona; there’s lots of studies but synthesize the information on the features of interest: the high-level water, the basal, the deep confined, and specifically the connectivity of those and base it on the geochemical and geophysical studies. That is sort of Ryan Imata’s and contacts’ wheelhouse. 2) Then what Katie spoke to about GDEs, can we document the current state of knowledge regarding Kona groundwater dependent ecosystems. I am not very familiar with them except for anchialine ponds and ʻōpae ʻula, but there are multiple species that are of management concern and they’re documented by the National Park Service, so let’s use that. Which species, where they exist, any information on their life cycles including sensitivities, goldilocks effects, whatnot. It’s helpful to have that information in the record. 3) And then potential or established linkages to traditional and customary practices if they’re ecological. I also know there’s paʻakai making in the area, so there’s other traditional and customary practices, so that’s the third item for staff. While it’s the job of the applicant to do the Ka Paʻakai analysis regarding traditional and customary practices, we need to make sure that we are competent and knowledgeable enough to evaluate that. If we have a report from the National Park Service, offer it there or maybe other reports. I don’t know if Kumu Pono Associates has done work in this region. We should be using the best available information to evaluate applicants on their Ka Paʻakai analysis. 4) Finally, a fourth item would be to at least begin to propose mitigation options. Say if monitoring revealed a trend towards detrimental effects and assuming we are sampling at the frequency needed, what are the course corrections? Is it halt pumping, is it step it down? Provide scenarios. Yes, we don’t know exactly everything, but we can show that we are thinking about it in intelligent, articulate ways and leave that as a paper trail to show that as a Commission, we are doing our best to make informed decisions in a complex system. We can’t just say it’s hard, and that there’s no effects. That’s logically problematic, so I don’t want to be negative, but I think three things again. Addendums from the applicants and then staff come back. What I would like to request is a deferral, but I would want to know from staff how long it might take? I think it could be doable within two months, but that’s my thinking.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Thank you, Chair. A couple things I wanted to point out is that the National Park Service is in a different aquifer from where we’re drilling this well and the National Park Service itself pointed that out to you in their initial letter in 2018. So, any study done on groundwater impacting the park is a different aquifer. I think it would be hard to infer any implication on the adjacent aquifer. Number two is unless I’m mistaken, I thought the staff submittal indicated that they did the Ka Paʻakai analysis. If that’s not correct, we should further understand that, but it was very clear that the staff did that. I think Dr. Leonard wanted to say a few words, thank you.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Chair Chang, aloha, members of the Commission. I would like to clarify what Director Barbour just referred to, the aquifer. He’s thinking about it differently than you would. Obviously we are all of the same Keauhou Aquifer; however, I think it’s reasonable even the hydrologists, even the National Park will recognize that not all water flows everywhere and that the waters that flow from the Ota Well catchment area are likely to not flow towards the National Park and therefore it’s highly unlikely, there’s virtually no scientific support for the concept that this particular well would have any negative impact on cultural and traditional practices that are taking place at the park. Which I think goes to your question, Chair Chang as to what Ms. Obrey referred to as standing with respect to questioning the Ka Paʻakai analysis. To Ms. Obrey’s concerns about not answering some of her questions, specifically the details of the monitoring plan and this also goes to Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani’s comments. There were no specific details attached to the original wording of condition 1d. It was in fact left entirely up to NELHA to determine what would be an appropriate sampling program and monitoring program in this respect had we gone forward with that. We specifically left those details out of this revision for that very same reason, believing that it was not just up to us to decide what the parameters should be, but through consultation with community and subject matter experts. I am not a hydrologist, I’m not a geologist, I’m a PhD marine biologist. I know more about fishes and limu than I know about rocks and so I would want to rely on input from subject matter experts in determining what are the appropriate parameters and the frequencies of sampling, of course. Of course we understand the relationship of sampling frequency relative to time variant changes. The sampling program was not described in detail is not because we haven’t thought about it, but because we didn’t want to impose it at this time because I don’t think that anybody in this room or that room right now knows exactly what we should and should not be sampling and measuring for. I think that’s a subject for discussion that can be had as the project moves forward. That was always our intent and going to the Ka Paʻakai analysis, when this project was initially started, state agencies, that wasn’t even a word that was being passed around at the time. It was just coming to the level of consciousness of State staffers and it was the Commission itself that directed CWRM staff to undertake the Ka Paʻakai analysis as a condition for non-designation. That was always understood and I believe that Mr. Hardy would testify to that fact. In fact I believe that staff under his guidance did conduct what they felt was a sufficient Ka Paʻakai analysis, now whether that that is in fact considered sufficient now and I certainly understand that perspective has changed. Chair Chang has made very clear that she believes that it is the applicant who should be responsible for the Ka Paʻakai analysis. I believe that that is a relatively recent focus and we were all coming to terms with it. I still have not found a public servant who really understands what the Ka Paʻakai analysis really is and what it should look like, how it should be done. We’re all trying to figure this out and we’re happy to continue to figure this out. We’re happy to continue to have conversations, but I think that it’s important to take into the history of this project and our request. Finally, going to comments about triggers and responses. As I testified in the last meeting, I do not believe that it is up to NELHA or that that it is NELHA’s purview to declare what an appropriate trigger is or response. We would collect data, but I believe that it is up to CWRM to figure out what to do with them. For example, one of the parameters that I believe is considered to be very important in my discussion with some subject matter experts is to measure the thickness and depth of the leading edge of the of the basal lens as it enters the ocean. That would be a very big indicator of the amount of flow through that system at that time, should give us an indication of water depletion should it be occurring. However, I’m not the person who’s going to say, well, if it drops by 2% we need to do something. I don’t know that, that’s not me.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Let me clarify, that was something that I suggested the staff really should do, so I’m in agreement with you.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Thank you, Commissioner. As to the responses, again I believe that that is up to CWRM and some hopefully community approved adaptive management plan that meets the various conflicting needs of the people who live here. With that I think I will finish talking, thank you.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"May I ask a follow up question? Hypothetically, how much time would you need to secure letters of support from the people you were connected with in the community?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"We’ve done nothing but that since the last Commission meeting. A lot of the people that we talk to are very busy, some of them don’t want to go on the record for whatever reason.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"For those who are willing. I’ve done this before for my own research proposals is you provide the template and if they’re willing to submit it in support, that’s helpful documentation to know. Otherwise, it’s just your word that you met with a bunch of people, but at least some of them I’m sure if they believe in this.",1,B2,04/16/2024
I believe you should have maybe 10 or 12 such letters of support in your information packets now from people who have submitted.,1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yeah, we had about 12 people that submitted testimony is our understanding.",1,B2,04/16/2024
Not counting those who testified verbally today.,1,B2,04/16/2024
"But these don’t necessarily speak to folks who engage in say traditional and customary practices in Kona and I know you’ve talked to some, right? What we have are organizations that have economic interest in seeing water developed, but I think for us it would really be helpful to see the evidence that you connected with folks as you explained in your last meeting.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Just to be clear, we tried to connect with as many people that Deputy Director Manuel spoke with when he developed these conditions. We have no idea who he spoke to, we can’t find anybody that knows who he discussed these proposed conditions with. We even asked Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation, could you let us know? They didn’t respond to our request to find out who Deputy Director Manuel spoke with. He didn’t speak with us, he never discussed those proposed conditions with us before he brought them to the Board, so we don’t know who he discussed it with, we couldn’t figure out who to follow up with. We did talk with ʻAha Moku, I thought they were going to be here today. I thought they presented a letter of testimony. We talked with several other kūpuna in the area, I thought they were going to present testimony. Jerome Kanuha was here, he is a lineal descendant and I believe spoke for the [inaudible]. We can try again, we can do it in a month, we’ll try again, but my point would be is we received no comments in opposition to our proposed modifications to the conditions. We didn’t receive any opposition except for perhaps Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation who was asking for more information. I guess they would be the only ones in opposition.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Greg, I think for me similarly, it’s having that administrative record documenting whether you get support or not. I’m all about process, who did you speak to, what were some of their comments. I mean the Ka Paʻakai analysis is based upon the facts that are presented to the Board. The Commission should not be doing any independent outreach, we should be relying upon...I looked at what was presented in 2022, ʻAha Moku testimony, some of the other testimony to help me identify what are the valued cultural, natural, and environmental resources including traditional and customary practices. I think Jerome Kanuha was very helpful, he’s from that ahupuaʻa. I think that to me, especially by him saying he originally was opposed to this but now he has a better understanding. I think for me, what I’m looking for is a good record, one documenting who you spoke to. If you don’t get any letters of support, I’m more interested in the process that you undertook to consult, from what period of time to now, who did you meet with, what were some of the information you shared, what were their comments? If you could include things that specifically related to traditional and customary practices because again, I know that you spoke to Uncle Charlie Young, you spoke to Jerome Kanuha, you spoke to other people from this area. Those to me are very credible people who come from the area who have in instances, do have a connection to the place. I think that’s important, but that’s not part of the record that’s before us and to Jonathan’s point, if we get litigated, what’s the record that we’re going to show to defend the action that we take? Right now, the record is a little sparse because we have a lot of what you’re saying, not documentation confirming what you’re saying. Again, I think to put you in the best light, it would be helpful to have that. What I’m hearing is one, Aurora came up with her recommendations, I also hear a request for a deferral to provide staff and NELHA opportunity to come back. I also know that NELHA has been waiting for a while and so time is of the essence. I’m hoping you still have those funds available, but what is a reasonable time in light of some of the comments that Aurora came up with for Ryan, Dean, you guys to address from staffs’ standpoint and then Greg, from your standpoint to come up with some of this additional information to support your application? 30 days?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"If I can weigh in a little bit, I respect and understand Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani’s request and even with respect to Ka Paʻakai and most of what has transpired so far. The Commission approved the permit and the Commission approved the Ka Paʻakai analysis back in 2022 so while I’m not necessarily adverse to providing, doing a deeper dive into the research, I think that that was kind of presented to the Commission in 2022 and was approved by the Commission in 2022. What we’re putting forward is really just the amendments to 1a and 1d and I think what Aurora, part of the things that she’s talking about are maybe addressed in the Adaptive Management Plan and I think quite frankly I’m just going to be honest here, should have been really addressed in a GDE Symposium 2. Where does that leave us today and timewise? My thoughts are that given the fact that the Commission approved this, I think we should focus our efforts on looking specifically at conditions 1a and 1d rather than opening up the entire process all over again. That’s kind of my thoughts and I think if we focus on 1a and 1d as the areas where we’re going to put the scrutiny on, I think that we can come back pretty timely.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Except that, Ryan, I’ve got a potential contested case because I think there’s concerns that we didn’t adequately address Ka Paʻakai. I will tell you from my understanding of Ka Paʻakai, it is the Commission that’s supposed to make the findings and I don’t know whether there were findings in 2022. I think there was a report by the Commission and staff, excuse me, there was a report prepared by staff, but I think Ka Paʻakai, based on my understanding, the court cases require this body to make specific findings on one, identification of the valued cultural resources. What I’m hearing today is Ms. Obrey’s clients are alleging that we haven’t satisfied Ka Paʻakai analysis, the record, we haven’t made those specific findings. I will say within the record there might be, but I don’t know if in 2022 there were findings made by the Commission to do that. The court has said you cannot delegate that, so even to staff. I think we need to move on. Dean, listening to all of this, can you come back? First, let me ask Greg, are you willing to come back in 30 days? Now, I haven’t even heard from Ms. Obrey, whether she may still file the contested case, but are you willing to come back in 30 days?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Sure, absolutely, but she said no matter what you do, she’s going to file a contested case.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"That’s ok, I cannot, that’s up to her, I’m just asking you. Dean, can you do that?",1,B2,04/16/2024
You want us to compile all of the data and synthesize it into some summary? I don’t know if that 30 days is sufficient.,1,B2,04/16/2024
Can you use ChatGPT? Sorry.,1,B2,04/16/2024
"Oh my goodness. I don’t know, if it was me personally, I’d need two months just because it’s a bit of literature, but I don’t know your guys’ workload as the Leg(islature) eases off. Maybe it’s possible to prioritize that and I am happy to help coalesce the researchers that might really help to vet it.",1,B2,04/16/2024
I’m thinking minimum two months.,1,B2,04/16/2024
"Okay, so I go back to you, Greg. Are you willing to come back? Now that, I haven’t even considered the fact that Greg Barbour could ask for a contested case, but Greg are you willing to come back in 60 days?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Another question, too, is the funding. You might want to get clarification on the availability of funding.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yeah, we can definitely come back.",1,B2,04/16/2024
Do you still have funding for your well?,1,B2,04/16/2024
We have no funding whatsoever.,1,B2,04/16/2024
"I don’t mean to belittle that, but you still are going to move forward with the well, assuming you get the permit with these conditions?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yeah. Just for clarification, we are in Governor Green’s budget for $5 million. House version did not include the $5 million, Senate version did not include the $5 million, but we could always ask the, I see Dean is back, the HHFDC board for approval to use some of their funds. Dean?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Yes, that’s correct. We do have a budget for Ota Well, so if the permit were approved, we could move ahead with funding the house portion of the well.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Can I be clear what we’re looking for then? To satisfy Ka Paʻakai, we will have explicit identification of cultural practices in the area, we will understand the impacts upon the practices, we will understand if there is any need for a reasonable mitigation, there will be a record of how that was determined, who was talked to, who was consulted, what studies, what individuals were consulted so we know how that was determined. That technically is all the promise of the applicant, then there will be your analysis, staff’s analysis as to what you feel about that so your record may be determination of the record presented us from the applicant?",1,B2,04/16/2024

"While she does that, can I ask a question of the Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Laros? If she’s still there?",1,B2,04/16/2024
"To what extent does the Chamber offer any educational classes or sessions for discussing the importance of investment in water source protection since they’re all users of the resource? And resource monitoring? We had an earlier discussion on the importance of having that data in order to make intelligent decisions about allocations and development of water resource. Are you doing any of that? Thirdly, does your membership have a good understanding of Ka Paʻakai analysis and why that is so critical to bodies like us? How the decisions or the submittals that come before us for which somebody is waiting for a resource to develop a project and so forth must go through the analysis that we’re talking about. The more our public knows the responsibilities of the Commission and the framework of balancing that we have, the more efficiently we can process things. I just wondered if you’re doing anything at your level as an affinity group for business to promote a better understanding of the responsibilities and why that’s important.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"Thank you for that question. We have an economic development committee and during COVID we went to all virtual meetings. We have over 50 people on that committee, it’s chaired by a gentleman named Ross Wilson, Jr. He’s been in the community a long time, from Hawaiʻi. What we’ve done over the last two plus, we’ve had water development as a top priority since the end of 2021, so all of 2022, 2023, and now we’re into 2024. Through our economic development committee, we’ve actually had Chair Chang has come and spoke with us, we’ve had, it was Lt. Governor Green come speak to us about water, we’ve had, is it Leimana DaMate came and spoke to us about Ka Paʻakai. She came and gave us an overview along with Charlie Young. They both presented and so we’ve been educating our membership through that conduit, economic development committee. Then last year we did a mayor’s luncheon up at the Hāpuna, the Westin Hāpuna, you know that property and we did three different panel discussions on our top priorities of housing, water development, and we also have astronomy. We did have Keith was part of the panel, Greg was part of the panel, and we had some County, Mayor, that kind of thing. We actually had a panel discussion for our entire membership, anyone that came. There were about maybe 220 people that attended that. A lot of people after that event were very surprised, their big aha! moment was how crucial water development is in West Hawaiʻi to all of the rest of our needs, which like I said in my testimony, how important housing is. How important housing is not just for the overall community, but our employers need employees, and employees can’t find affordable housing. It’s all connected and so we have been doing quite a bit with our entire membership and the West Hawaiʻi business community on educating them about this important topic.",1,B2,04/16/2024

"I’ve given it a lot of thought and I think the kind of information that Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani is trying to get is the kind of thing that I think we’re looking for in the first place out of a contested case hearing. I have a very high expectation for 60 days from now if we aren’t going to go forward with this contested case hearing request, but I think if that’s...we are going to stay withdrawn.",1,B2,04/16/2024
"I greatly appreciate your willingness to work with, I would urge you if you would prefer to send comments directly to CWRM, comments that you may have about your members, their practices. Please feel free to send it over to them. The more information we have about your concerns, copy NELHA and HHFDC as well, but the more information we get, it only helps us make an informed decision. I greatly appreciate your willingness to work with us.

That was the crux of our testimony.,1,B2,04/16/2024

You both can meet in the middle of Māmalahoa Highway in the middle, you meet at a particular time, meet on the shoulder, don’t get hit by anybody, but however it would be beneficial. This is not the forum to meet for the first time, this doesn’t help the Commission. Greg, he’s hearing Dean, Ashley is here. With that being said, Greg you heard that?

General Informational Briefing on Water Reservations for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands by Commission Staff,0,C1,06/18/2024
"PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Katie Roth, Planning Branch Chief; Dr. Ayron Strauch, Acting Stream Protection and Management Branch Chief",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Staff presented the process of reserving water, existing and pending Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) water reservations, and future DHHL water demands.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Can I interrupt you for a second? That last point- may have to adjust the IIFS (interim instream flow standard)- stream water is a resource and that's a public trust purpose, so are you saying from your standpoint that DHHL has superior rights than the stream itself?",0,C1,06/18/2024
Maybe I'll defer that to Ayron if he wants to comment a little bit more about his process when establishing.,0,C1,06/18/2024
"You can answer that later, I just wanted to interrupt you. KATIE ROTH: Okay, do you want to answer it now or later?",0,C1,06/18/2024
When we get into the discussion.,0,C1,06/18/2024
"Aloha Commissioners, Ayron Strauch of the Stream Protection and Management Branch. The modification of an IIFS in the balancing of non-instream uses might be needed to accommodate a reservation or use for DHHL as a public trust use. One example would be the 2018 decision and order in Nā Wai ʻEhā that sets an IIFS on North Waiʻehu as natural flow. At the time, DHHL was not a party to the Nā Wai ʻEhā contested case and their potential non-instream usage was not considered in the decision, but they have lands in Waiʻehu that could potentially utilize non-potable water. So, we might need to modify the North Waiʻehu IIFS to accommodate those uses.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"But I'm talking about cases where usually when we set an IIFS, it's been my experience that we basically set it at the minimum that allows viable stream life, not way above it. In a case where the IIFS is at a level that any lowering of it all would harm the stream, are you saying that from your standpoint we have to do that?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I'm not making a blanket statement across all IIFS and in actuality I don't think most IIFS have been minimum, they've been above the minimum.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"So what would happen then if you have a DHHL reservation request which is reasonable, but it takes off more from the stream than what would be the minimal viability?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"That would be a balancing that the Commission would need to make. The stream is not more important as compared to DHHL, it's equally important as DHHL.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Okay, so what is the compromise? The reason I ask is that there have been some dicta by the Supreme Court that said there may be instances where you have to destroy the resource to accommodate uses, never went beyond that to say how do you decide that. Okay, but in this case there will come a time because DHHL is finally getting enough lands to be used, especially in rural areas where they don't have access to a public water supply system, they have to put in their own. There's going to be a time that we have to decide, but from my standpoint, if you take a stream below viability, that's destroying the stream. It seems to me from my standpoint you can only draw enough water for off-stream uses, including DHHL where it does not affect the stream viability. Now the obvious answer is that other users get their water taken away for DHHL because DHHL is a public trust purpose. I think that also when in the current Water Management Areas, if you have unused or unpermitted excess in a particular aquifer or in a stream area and DHHL gets a reservation, that amount of water gets taken off about what is available for other permits, right? That’s what happens?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"If you may allow me to comment, the history behind stream diversions and IIFS has been that the construction of the dam essentially took all but the high flows. I would assume, and we would probably make the recommendation that, to meet, say a DHHL need or any other need, we should not be so destructive to the stream as to completely drain it or completely remove all but the high flows, such that even if we lowered an IIFS to say the 64% of medium base flow, which has kind of been accepted as that minimum that you're talking about, there is still opportunity to provide for the flushing of larvae or nutrients or sediment or coarse woody debris to provide for the habitat, to keep the riffles and runs flowing, so that we have migratory pathways maintained. So that we have other instream values not just ʻoʻopu and ʻōpae, but the recreational needs are met. The downstream uses are maintained, the nearshore impacts are preserved, so that I think we can find a balance where the stream is protected and the DHHL needs are met.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Wait a second though, you cannot meet all of DHHL needs if you have those minimal requirements for continued stream flow, so something has to give. DHHL cannot get everything that they want in a particular...except at the cost of other off-stream users.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"On a case by case basis with sufficient storage, I mean DHHL is not going to start a sugar plantation. I think there is some way forward that meets all needs in some...",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I absolutely disagree with that, you can't have everything for everybody.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I understand that, what I'm saying is that we're not dealing with really huge rivers in Hawaiʻi, we're dealing with fairly small streams. Say you're having an off-stream use, even those in non-management areas that have riparian or appurtenant rights, appurtenant rights is a little different because they're also sort of a public trust purpose. You’re going to have to come to a time where you cannot say that one public trust purpose has absolute priority or the other. I don't think that you can get to a case, my preference, I don't know if it’s a legal preference, would we still have to maintain minimal viable stream flows at the cost of DHHL getting all the water that they want, but we're going to get a case like that eventually.",0,C1,06/18/2024
It will come to things like climate change and the severity of say drought conditions and the length of those drought conditions. Everything's going to be affected.,0,C1,06/18/2024
"Even without those changes, as DHHL is able to provide their beneficiaries homesteads and increase water, you'll get to a point where the amount of water available is not going to be enough even in aquifers.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Asking another way if I might, you said that CWRM has never approved reservations for other than DHHL and that may be the case. Can we make reservations for other public trust uses?",0,C1,06/18/2024
My understanding is yes.,0,C1,06/18/2024
"Okay, it just hasn't been done yet.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Can I interrupt on there because let me see if Barry is still around. I think long time ago I told Barry, why don't you guys ask for reservations for the public water systems so that you don't have to be competing with private people all the time? So it is a possibility.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Exactly, that's correct for household use, for the rest of the public if you will. That's exactly right.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Back to your earlier point, Larry, in my years on the Commission, we never tried to give every everything they wanted. We tried to balance as best we could and would you agree that the East Maui contested case discussion might be relevant here where every stream was different. Some streams were highly compromised and so forth and those we put a minimal wetted pathway, other streams were really heavy kalo users and so forth. We treated those, made sure they had enough for their public trust uses and then we withdrew what we could to get to DHHL lands and so forth, but it was very much a balancing act. We don't, especially now with DHHL’s additional infusion, much needed infusion of cash that'll allow more development, I'm really keen to hear how that's going to change their reservation needs in the future because we got to rejigger, we got to rebalance again. Now this is just stream, now ground is a whole different issue and much of their needs will be supplied by groundwater, I assume, but when it comes to streams it really is a challenging balancing.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Paul, if you have a comment on that, go ahead.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"This was a follow-up question, we asked whether we can make reservations. Do you think we have a duty to make reservations for other people for future needs or public trust users?",0,C1,06/18/2024
I don't know if I would comment on without and that's maybe a legal...,0,C1,06/18/2024
You said we have a duty to DHHL.,0,C1,06/18/2024
My question relates to this.,0,C1,06/18/2024
"Do we have a duty to take into account the needs of other public trust users? That's the question, maybe that's a question for the AG.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I think my question relates to this and I'll just say it's a bit of a red herring to frame other [inaudible], but DHHL has a particular status, correct? Katie can you run down the history of that ruling? My understanding is DHHL has this level of priority because of conditions of Statehood and this is somewhat analogous to the Winters Doctrine in the US where Navajo have rights of prior appropriation. Do you have that background Katie?",0,C1,06/18/2024
Maybe I would defer to Andrew and DHHL staff to come up and comment on that.,0,C1,06/18/2024
"Aloha Andrew Choy, representing the Department of Hawaiian Homelands, thank you for the question Commissioner Kagawa. The Department has a unique history. As you folks know it was established by Congress in 1921, adopted by the full Congress back then. It was administered by the Territory of Hawaiʻi up until Statehood. Now when Hawaiʻi was admitted to the US through the Admissions Act, one of the conditions of the Admissions Act was that the State would take on the responsibility of carrying out the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act as a condition of Statehood. That is one statutory authority. The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act was thus incorporated into State of Hawaiʻi’s Constitution. Its water rights are articulated as part of the State's Constitution, it's also identified specifically in the Water Code as and also further validated by Supreme Court rulings as a public trust purpose use of water. I don't know if that answered your question, Commissioner?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I think it does because I think without understanding some of that legal context, I guess it gets uncomfortably misfocused and I think what we want to do is stay on what the Commission's responsibility to the statutes is. I wanted to get back to Katie's presentation and understand, so DHHL has this privilege in designated and non-designated areas, some of it is unexercised, much of it is paper water. What are the implications for the matters coming before us? I know we've had the Waimea Watershed matter which is going to be the next action item. There are these proposals for Maui and Molokaʻi, everyone's going to have their claim and DHHL being one of them, that need to be balanced a little bit differently than multiple permitees. Am I understanding that correctly? Is that the way we should be thinking about it from your perspective?",0,C1,06/18/2024
Can you just articulate the specific question you have?,0,C1,06/18/2024
"Mostly I'm trying to mirror back that I'm understanding kind of what we need to take away from this presentation, that we need to understand that DHHL has this particular ability to make reservations in both designated and undesignated areas, and that we need to factor it in. But DHHL is not just another permit applicant, right? So, how do we as Commissioners need to be weighting things? I think that's some of what the other Commissioners have been trying to get at.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I think you're absolutely correct. One of the major takeaways from this presentation, like you said, DHHL as one public trust use of water does have priority. How we figure out a way to balance that with other both public trust uses of water and other reasonable and beneficial uses of water is something that needs to be discussed and will come up more as we see less water availability in certain areas, impacts of climate change, what have you. The presentation also mentions that DHHL has approximately 15% of paper water, but there's more needed, so you're right. There is going to need to be more conversations about what those needs look like and ways that we can better collaborate not only with DHHL but with the counties to better understand how we can, if maybe the county has the ability to provide water to DHHL, how we spread out that duty of not just the infrastructure to make sure that DHHL uses have adequate supplies. Does that kind of answer your question or get at kind of the context of the presentation?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I think so and I want to have a little bit [inaudible] since it's an informational briefing, not an action item. Let me back up, when I started on the Commission in 2021 we were talking about Molokaʻi and Maui and there were some interesting proposals that I remember DHHL bringing up that were a bit more holistic than the normal permit applicant, about their investment, the recognition of scarce water, their interest in investing also in watershed protection. Maybe this is for Ayron, personally I don't view things as just a zero-sum game, some things are maxed out, but there's also room for innovation and I think some of that conversation had come up on Maui. I remember Commissioner Meyer brought up R1 and R1 use is coming up again. How do we slice the pie in equitable ways, but also try and innovate and expand or conserve? Sure, we deal with permits and allocation but what are the things we can also be supporting as a Commission as we think about the needs that are outstripping supply? Ayron, can you remind us again where are the spaces, where we need to focus some energy and attention on?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I will just comment about, DHHL has a reservation on the Big Island in the Māhukona aquifer system, but they have broader regional needs that can't just be met from the one aquifer. In developing an interim instream flow standard for Waikoloa Stream, for example, the South Kohala drinking water system, which diverts almost the entirety of Kohākōhau and Waikoloa Streams to provide for drinking water supply, the County's water system could be used to meet portable needs that may have originally been met with a reservation from groundwater. This is where we are considering establishing an instream flow standard to protect instream values, but then there are also other public trust uses that could be met or should be met with the same water essentially or from the same source, especially since the stream diversions that feed the system are on DHHL land. It's kind of a little bit full circle in that the resources that could be used to meet DHHL’s needs should be in the consideration of the establishment of an action to protect the resource. I don't know if that answers your question or not.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I want to remind Commission members that another public trust purpose is domestic uses of the general public. That's never been tested. I assume that means public water supply systems, but public water supply systems also provide agriculture and industrial use uses. That's going to be a really thorny question about what part of that is a part of this.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Water to Hawaiian Homes, as well. Water to Hawaiian Homes beneficiaries, as well.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Sure, all I'm saying is that aside from the DHHL reservations, domestic uses of the general public is an equal [inaudible] as is the resource itself. Down the road, none of us will be around, but that's going to bump heads and you're going to have to come to some kind of compromise about not everybody can get all the water they want and particularly on the stream. Not all streams are going to have to be [inaudible]. Now, aquifers are a different question. You get beyond the sustainable yield and you start to permanently destroy the aquifer, so that's going to be a different issue.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I'd like to ask again, do we have a duty to make reservations for other public trust users and you said you didn't know? Could you find an answer to that question, could you research that? I mean I'm not sure the Commissioners have time to do that and the resource of the...",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I can reframe my response. I don't think it's accurate to say I don't know, I think that there is a duty definitely to public trust uses of water and to find a reasonable, when we have to balance reasonable and beneficial use as well. I think that there's a lot more to say on that topic and that's definitely something that if you want us to investigate, we can definitely do that, to come up with a more formal opinion if that's something that the Commission is interested in.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I think it'd be very helpful if you could characterize that for us and get a comprehensive opinion in that respect because as Larry said, it's going to come up and it's going to come at us four square at some point with respect to surface water and groundwater, as well. Further, you mentioned that 15% of DHHL needs are being met by current reservations, if I have that correct. Where does that number come from?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"That 15% is reflected in what we would consider paper water, not all of that is what we would call wet water and I could maybe defer to Andrew again to provide more details.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"You don't know where the numbers come from, you didn't prepare that number yourself?",0,C1,06/18/2024
That is the number provided by DHHL.,0,C1,06/18/2024
"I see, okay it's from DHHL. You answered that question for me, thank you.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"When we calculate our reservation requests to the Water Commission, it's really based off of our Island Plans. As you folks know, the Hawaiian Homes Commission has exclusive land use authority over Hawaiian Homelands. Our Island Plans articulate our Commission's land use policy for our land, so are we going to use it for residential, are we going to use it for ag, are we going to use it for commercial? Our water reservations are based in large part on our Island Plans. We've made reservations for portions of our lands, but not all of our lands so that's where that number came from.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"In calculating that number, it's interesting, it's kind of a gross number and were other sources considered in looking at that only 15% being available in terms of the public water systems that are available? Public utilities and that sort of thing which is where the majority of Hawaiian Homes beneficiaries get their water today? Or was that ignored and just saying, okay we need that reservation just as an estimate of the total quantity of water that DHHL beneficiaries will need going forward, do you know?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"If I understand your question correctly, I believe the Water Code says that our reservations are for both current and future needs of water. When we designate our lands for residential, it's normally based off of the usual county municipal standards of 600 gallons per lot per day, so we will designate say 10 acres for residential and we'll do a back of the order envelope calculation of how many lots at say 5,000 square feet or 75,000 square feet that we can get from that area and that's what we base our estimate.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I understand, but I’m talking about where is it coming from. What’s the source? Did you assume that any of that would come from the public utility or county sources?",0,C1,06/18/2024
I think in certain locations where the county system is within close proximity to our lands then the assumption is we will try to work with the municipality.,0,C1,06/18/2024
Do you know for sure? Is that taken into account in the 15% or not?,0,C1,06/18/2024
Do we know for sure if the county has...,0,C1,06/18/2024
"In other words, does the 15% assume that other public sources would be providing water to DHHL properties?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"When we calculate our reservations, it's based on what is needed for homesteading.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I understand, what you're saying is it doesn't.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Yeah, that's your responsibility as the Water Commission. COMMISSIONER MEYER: I hear you, okay thanks.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Andrew, when you say it's based upon the Island Plans, what's the time frame? Is that when you're ready to build? Because we say Water Code is past, present, and future, so what is your time frame?",0,C1,06/18/2024
That's an excellent question. Our Island Plans for our administrative rule is a 20-year outlook on what we can or hopefully can develop assuming that we receive sufficient funding for developments.,0,C1,06/18/2024
Are the reservations based upon a future estimate up to 20 years?,0,C1,06/18/2024
"Yes, because it's based on our Island Plans and our Island Plans have a 20-year outlook.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I guess this is water staff, so when we have to have make the hard questions about water allocations, we take their reservations as is whether they are ready to build or not. Do we distinguish between whether it’s a DHHL residential use or DHHL industrial commercial use? Is there a distinction? Is it just if DHHL’s reservations we take them as a whole or do we distinguish the types of use as we would for example public trust?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Their calculation is dependent on their land use plans and then just comes up with that number, we don't make that...",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Okay, so we take it as DHHL reservations, but Andrew do you guys distinguish when you submit to us? Is there a difference between domestic and commercial?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"We do try to identify for the Commission staff what our reservation amount is based off of and again that's per our land uses. We do distinguish our residential demand, our agricultural demand, our commercial demand. The reservations that we have submitted to the Water Commission to date have been primarily for our homesteading purposes, either residential, agriculture or pastoral.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"There's a comment that you made that, well maybe I should ask the question. Who pays for the water infrastructure, who pays for the delivery of water?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I think that is a question that we would like to know the answer, as well. Anecdotally, we've had some good working relationships with various counties of water supply. We continue to have dynamic conversations with them on how to fulfill the obligation of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act as a responsibility of the entire State, not just the Hawaiian Home Lands Department. We do feel that there is some level of collaboration and contribution needed from all parties. What that looks like is on a case- by-case basis.",0,C1,06/18/2024
Because do you include the cost of infrastructure when you're doing your development plans? Is the cost of developing a water infrastructure system part of your cost estimate?,0,C1,06/18/2024
"Yes, when we develop our cost estimates it's both for on-site and off- site infrastructure.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"That's a really good point, this is all about collaboration, working together, and sharing. Absolutely.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Hi Andrew, I guess to help sharpen Commissioner Meyer's question is that if the water supply for your development is coming from a public water utility, are you then sort of double dipping or double accounting for that water? Because the public Department of Water has a supply plan, a demand plan. You are submitting a water demand plan, as well. You don't need to answer that right away, but as you start getting into your development to again identify that to help us help planning, not to double account for the water.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Thanks for that question, Commissioner Katayama. We have been a lot more progressive and proactive in trying to reach out to the county Department of Water Supplies to make sure that their Water Use and Development Plan is inclusive of our water developments. A great example is actually on the Kauaʻi County Department of Water Supply, they've worked really well with us in trying to outreach to our beneficiaries. They sat down with us, they went through the effort of planning meetings specifically for our beneficiaries to make sure that their input is included in their Water Use and Development Plan.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"That's great and I think we'll get smarter and sharpen our focus on these things and Katie, thank you very much for your presentation. It really helped me zero in on specific statutes on how water reservations are made. One sort of comment is that you've identified several different water plans from resources, projects and if you were to look at the dates of when those plans were adopted, you find a sort of a long period. I guess my question is, is there a way to better synchronize the plans because it seems that we're dependent on a lot of these plans from the county, Water Use and Development Plan to the Water Protection Plan. I mean all of these should be used and living plans and some of these things are like 10 years old.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"That is a requirement, it just doesn't get done on a timely basis.",0,C1,06/18/2024
Is there a process to do a better synchronization of these plans?,0,C1,06/18/2024
"It's definitely a comment we've heard before in terms of the updates to these various components of the Hawaiʻi Water Plan and how to get them more in sync because as you mentioned, they should be communicating with one another and they're being referenced by each other. If you have one that’s outdated...",0,C1,06/18/2024
That's how decisions are being made by each of them.,0,C1,06/18/2024
"Exactly. As part of our update to the Hawaii Water Plan framework which I know we are a little delinquent in getting before you, that is something that we hope to address in that framework document to provide better guidance on how we do that.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I think I remember that cascade of planning that gets done is like painting the Golden Gate Bridge. By the time you get to the end of it, you got to go back because the first part of it all changed.",0,C1,06/18/2024
The last piece is always the timing piece.,0,C1,06/18/2024
"It falls off. It's a challenge, but I know you folks do your best and what I'm hearing though is that you do your plans for 20-year horizon and so the new infusion which is a sentinel event of 600 billion and so forth that your chair was trying to leverage like crazy is not changing. I think you guys came in 2018 and we did your reservations on the basis of your current and foreseeable needs at 2018. That is fairly unchanged by the new event of having more money? Or now that you just have some money to implement more of the plans that you had or are you accelerating your plan?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Thank you for the question. I think it's a combination of both. It's accelerating the lands that we already have. To your point, our chairman has been very adamant about looking at adding new lands to our inventory, lands that are not far and remote like the original lands that we did receive. He's been looking at lands closer to infrastructure so that we can connect to the counties. To your point, like my colleagues in planning, we do update our plans on a regular basis, as well. We do have our own cascading diagram of our planning system but our Island Plans are due for an update. Our Hawaiʻi Island Plan was adopted by our Commission in 2002 and we're currently going through that planning process to update it, including the new acquisitions that the Department is acquiring on that particular island. We'll go through a similar process for all of our islands, including the new acquisitions that the recent $600 million gift from the Legislature has allowed us to acquire new lands across the State.",0,C1,06/18/2024
I would avoid using the word “gift” because it goes back to...,0,C1,06/18/2024
"...Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani's point and I think it would serve this Commission well to have a discussion of where that trust relationship comes from. I think we all have certain assumptions and certain knowledge, but there's a history here of obligation, not just it's nice or it's a concession to the host culture and so forth. There are obligations made. I appreciate, going back to the question of double dipping and so forth, the chair now has been really thoughtful by getting infill parcels like the one in Kailua that was just acquired and Waipoli on Kauaʻi and so forth near existing infrastructure. In that case, you don't double dip and have a reservation for that and then draw your resource from the county system, it's drawn from the county system and is not included in the reservation?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I think I'm going back to the point in Katie's presentation about what a reservation is. It's simply an acknowledgement that in certain aquifers or in certain surface water management areas, that the Department will require a certain amount of water. How that water gets conveyed to the DHHL lands, the reservation doesn't touch that. It just simply says that Water Commission acknowledges and reserves this water for the use of Hawaiian Home Lands. We still have to have conversations about how we get wet water to Hawaiian Home Lands, so that's often times in current practice done through conversations with Department of Water Supplies, through water development agreements in other far remote areas with private water system owners. It also should be noted we do own and operate four water systems, ours just being on Molokaʻi where we service about 400 customers and we also service customers off of Hawaiian Home Lands like the airport, the high school. We much rather prefer to work with county Department of Water Supplies to provide service to our areas. As through our own experience, owning and operating a water system is a very challenging task.",0,C1,06/18/2024
Not your core business. ANDREW CHOY: Correct.,0,C1,06/18/2024
"But of the reservations we have in place, how much of that is paper water did you say?",0,C1,06/18/2024
"That's a good question, we'll have to look at in how many places where our reservations have been converted to wet water.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"I think it would be good information to have and just speaks to the challenge of fulfilling the mission of the Hawaiian Homes trust, that the land set aside to fulfill that were generally remote and without infrastructure. We're supposed to put Hawaiians on homes, but then we have to pay all the cost of developing the infrastructure, except we're calling new strategies of, let's go where the infrastructure is and acquire land that may not have come to us in the original trust. That's why it's so long delayed that it takes forever to utilize the reservations we put aside from you because you're out in Kaʻū or you're out in some remote area.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"Maybe that does need to be part of the conversation earlier on when we make these reservation requests come before us, is to think more holistically about where the water actually will be coming from.",0,C1,06/18/2024
"There is a mechanism for addressing the double dipping, say that DHHL has a reservation for X amount of water and then over the years, part of that is being satisfied by public water systems. When you get to a point where you've maxed out the use at least on paper, the Commission will be starting to look at the actual allocation and uses of the permits in a particular area and we have the authority to reduce and reallocate. At that point in time, DHHL will say, well 30% of our reservation is being met by public water systems, so why don't you just reduce our reservation by that amount or at least if you resist, we can do it. But it harms nobody to keep that reservation when part of it is being met by public water systems and the issue only comes up when we're bumped up against the limit. I don't see a problem with a potential double dipping. One last comment is that your current head, Kali Watson has come full circle. He was in the cabinet when I was in the cabinet.",0,C1,06/18/2024

"So I'm now gonna go on to Item B2. It's a briefing by the US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 1876, ""Volcanic Aquifers of Hawai‘i - Contributions to Assessing Groundwater Availability on Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, Maui,"" presented by Scot Izuka, PhD, USGS.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Hi, Chair. Neil Fujii. Good morning, Chair and Members and (inaudible). So I'm just gonna introduce Scot Izuka, and then I'll (inaudible) his presentation. You guys probably all know Scot. Scot Izuka has been a hydrologist with the USGS Pacific Islands Water Science Center since 1989 and has conducted water resources studies in Hawai‘i, American Samoa, and Micronesia. Most of his work is in island groundwater and surface water hydrology, but he also has published research in geomorphology, climate, sedimentology, stratigraphy, geochemistry, geochronology paleontology, and paleogeography. Scot's currently the project lead for the Hawai‘i Volcanic Aquifer Study and several regional groundwater availability assessments being conducted by the USGS Water Availability and Use Science Program.

"Great. That's progress, okay.",0,B2,07/26/2023
There we go. Yeah.,0,B2,07/26/2023
"Okay, here we go. Okay. Let me hide this guy. Okay. Well, thank you, Neil, and thank you for inviting me to speak about this study that we've been doing. So I'm gonna talk today about Hawai‘i Volcanic Aquifer Study and give you some highlights of the results. This was a study—one of the studies that the USGS was doing across the nation of the groundwater availability of the principal aquifers in the United States. The final report, the third and final report of this study, was recently published, I think maybe about three or four months ago, and I—most of what I'm gonna talk about comes from this final report, but there are two other reports. The first report is a summary of the hydrogeology of Hawai‘i, and it includes updates all the way up to when it was published was kind of like the mid-2010s or so. It also includes updates on groundwater recharge for Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, and Maui. The second report—let's see. Let me get my pointer out here. Oops. The second report, that one goes down into the weeds about groundwater modeling. So for those who are interested in that, you can look at that, you know, if you're into mod flow and all of the details that go into that. of the information that I'm gonna be talking about, again, is in the final report, and there's also a fact sheet that's available. All of these are available online at these sites, or if you just Google USGS Publications Warehouse and Volcanic Aquifers of Hawaiʻi, you'll get it. Okay. So how to answer the question of how much groundwater is available in  from Hawaiʻi's aquifers? Well, all groundwater withdrawals have consequences. In Hawaiʻi, I am sure many of you are familiar with this, but those consequences are water-table decline, saltwater rise and encroachment  I guess you should see it down here  and reduction of groundwater discharge to springs, streams, wetlands, and the ocean. Groundwater availability depends on the severity of the consequences the community is willing to accept, so groundwater availability depends on what you're able to accept in consequences. And we know that those consequences  you know, it's a complicated question and, you know, involves human and environmental health considerations, economics, legal rights, and statutes, and so forth, which are kind of beyond the science part, but  Okay. The consequences also differ by hydrogeologic setting. Now, in the report, we group the groundwater occurrences in Hawaiʻi to four principal hydrogeologic settings. Again, these are probably very familiar to you, but  freshwater or basal lens setting, there's dike-impounded groundwater, there's thickly saturated aquifers, and then there's perched aquifers. I'll talk about the first three, anyway, subsequently. But there's also enigmatic occurrences, and this includes things like the Schofield Aquifer or Schofield high-level groundwater and some of the things that are being discovered on the Big Island that don't really fit into these principal hydrogeologic settings, and we'll talk about that a little bit. Okay. So the freshwater or basal lens, again, very familiar to you, freshwater floating buoyantly on saltwater in the aquifer. When you take groundwater from that, the consequences of taking groundwater from that is water-table reduction and saltwater rise, and reduction of discharge to the ocean. Where there is cap rock, then the freshwater lens is thicker because the cap rock resists the flow of water to the ocean. The fact is that the freshwater lens gets thicker, but it also causes some of the groundwater discharge to discharge above sea level to springs, such as the Pearl Harbor Springs are a good example. So when you take water from this system, again, you have water table decline and rise of saltwater and encroachment of saltwater, but you also have reduction of discharge to streams that are on land. In the dike-impounded groundwater system, we havelow-permeability dikes, volcanic dikes that have impounded groundwater to hundreds of feet above sea level. And where the erosion has exposed the dikes, then water discharges from these dike compartments feeds streams and supports stream base flow. When you take water from this system, and again you have water table decline and reduction of groundwater discharge to streams and springs and things on the land. There's also reduction of groundwater discharge to the ocean. There is some saltwater encroachment near the coast, but for the most part, this area is not gonna be affected by saltwater intrusion. Okay. And then there's the thickly saturated aquifers. These are aquifers that are not highly permeable, that the entire aquifer is made up out of low-permeability rock. And in particular, the example that I've worked on is the one on Kaua‘i in the Lihue Basin where lava flows—thick lava flows have filled in preexisting depressions and formed these thick low-permeability aquifers. And in this case, the freshwater saturates all the way to the land surface, and much of the—excuse me—much of the groundwater discharge occurs at streams above sea level. So, of course, if you take water from that, one of the biggest impacts is going to be to—would be reduction in streamflow. There is also reduction of groundwater discharge to the ocean. There likely is saltwater encroachment near the coast, but, you know, this Freshwater lens is pretty thick, so how far this might threaten wells further inland, we don't really know. Okay. So the one enigmatic occurrence that I'm gonna talk about today is the Schofield high-level groundwater. It's an area of high-level groundwater that's higher than you would expect from  in a high-permeability aquifer. We know from data, groundwater data that it's not perched; it's saturated all the way down to sea level, and freshwater probably extends quite a bit below sea level. Many hydrologists have postulated some sort of a groundwater barrier, like a dam vertical structure that is supporting this, but the actual structure is not really known. Now, the  probably the main consequence of taking water out of this is reduction of groundwater flow to adjacent aquifers, so, yeah, it will reduce the amount of water available in the adjacent aquifers. Okay. So to quantify the consequences of the groundwater withdrawal for this study, we used groundwater models of Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, and Maui. These islands have most of the  well, these islands have all of the principal hydrologic settings that we talked about before, so at least we can test them. We created calibrated models which had 2001 to 2010 conditions for pumping and recharge and land use, and so forth. So then we took this model, this calibrated model, and Then we did some scenarios looking backwards to see what would happen. When we compare these backwards scenarios—backward-looking scenarios—to the calibrated model, we can see how conditions that exist in 2001 to 2010 have impacted the groundwater resource. We also looked in the future and did some hypothetical scenarios with increased withdrawal and change in rainfall to see how these conditions might affect groundwater resources relative to the calibrated 2001 to 2010 conditions. For the first one, let's look backwards. In this example, we're looking at the past. One of the scenarios that we did was just shut down all the wells that we had in the 2001-2010 simulation. This would be looking back, you know, to pretty much predevelopment conditions. For example, this is just Oahu's, and these colors show the change in groundwater levels, the intensity of change in groundwater levels. You can see that by shutting down all the wells, it caused—well, it caused water levels to—I'm sorry, I've got to go back. I'll rephrase that. Looking at the no-withdrawal scenario and calibrated model, we can see how the 2001 to 2010 conditions impacted the past. Then we can see that the 2001 to 2010 conditions have caused groundwater levels, water levels, to decrease quite a bit in the dike-impounded groundwater areas.and a little bit more here because  but not as much in the Wai‘anae area because withdrawals are not as much as they are in the Ko‘olau side. The freshwater lens, despite having quite a bit of withdrawal in 2001 to 2010, can see that the water table hasn't declined quite as much as it has in the dike-impounded area, but that's because of the high permeability of the freshwater lens setting. But in the freshwater lens setting, the saltwater-freshwater boundary rose considerably under this 2001 to 2010 condition. So it shows that for the freshwater lenses, saltwater rise is one  gonna be one of the principal factors that limit groundwater availability. You know, there is a little bit also going on in the dike-impounded areas, but not as much as you see in the freshwater lens. This map shows the effect of the withdrawals on streamflow, and now, again, we see that most of the impact is happening in the streams in the dike-impounded groundwater areas. In the freshwater lens areas, it  there is an impact right at the  where the cap rock meets the aquifer, and there are  there is groundwater discharge to  to springs in the  in the freshwater lens. This is the Pearl Harbor Springs. Another simulation was to look at the combination of withdrawal and recharge, so we looked at  we simulated recharge in 1870, this was before the first modern well was.drilled, and then we combined it with the no-withdrawal scenario, and then by comparing that to the calibrated model, we could see what the impact of current recharge changes and pumping have. Most of the changes in recharge resulted  between these two periods have resulted in land use  have resulted from land use changes, including agriculture. And I'm gonna show Kaua‘i for this example and this is for water  changes in water levels. The agriculture has caused some areas to  for water levels in some areas to increase, and that's shown by these blue patches, and in some areas it has decreased as shown in the brown areas. The blue areas in particular for Kaua‘i correspond with irrigation reservoirs that are leaking, and they enhance the groundwater recharge, so they're going to reduce the effect of groundwater withdrawals in these areas. In areas where there's a reduction in recharge and lowering of water levels, that's going to exacerbate the effects of groundwater withdrawals. Another simulation was to look at  to the future, and this is to increase withdrawals in the future, and for this, we increased the withdrawals from conventional wells. These are the conventional vertical wells, wells that are drilled vertically, not tunnels. We did not increase the  simulate any increases in tunnel withdrawal, but  so just for the conventional wells. And this is a map of how the Increases looked. The bigger the dot, the bigger the increase. These increases are based on the permitted rates at the water commission, and in most cases, the permitted rates are actually higher than the actual groundwater withdrawal rates. And here's a map showing the water level changes caused by that scenario, and we can see that the big impact was in the Schofield Aquifer. You can see that's because there's a bunch of increases here. Oops. But there are also changes along the central corridor where the groundwater levels were increased. There's some increases in the dike-impounded groundwater areas. These are high-intensity; you can see the color here is kind of dark, so that indicates a high-intensity water level change, but it's not widespread. This is a map of the change in the saltwater-freshwater boundary, and you can see that, again, the big change is in the freshwater lens areas both in the south and in the north. This is a map of the change in streamflow, and the biggest change that's apparent here is at the springs by the cap rock, so the Pearl Harbor Springs and North Shore too. You don't see so much in the dike-impounded groundwater area, but that's probably because the model did not change the withdrawal in the tunnels, and much of the water that's developed in this area is from  from these tunnels. Okay. One thing we could say about the Schofield Aquifer is that this change in future withdrawals has  the model simulation does indicate that the fresh  the groundwater flow from the Schofield Aquifer to adjacent freshwater lenses in the north and in the south is gonna be reduced. It also pulls more water, causes more water to flow in from the dike-impounded groundwater areas. Okay. Now, looking at one more thing, and this is another future assessment, this was a change in rainfall. This was a climate change assessment. And for this, we used the statistical downscaling of RCP8.5 for the  for midcentury. I think you all are familiar with that. But it's a pretty dry scenario. And this indicates that  our model simulations indicate for the water levels that there will be some areas that will have large water level impacts, and in this case, it's Waena, the dry side of Oʻahu. It's  it also has  you can see some color in the impounded areas on  of the Koʻolau and in the Schofield high-level aquifer. This map shows the change in saltwater-freshwater boundary caused by the reduction in rainfall, and we can see that accompanying the change in water levels that we saw in the previous map is saltwater encroachment in the Waiʻanae area. So to summarize, the primary consequences limiting The availability of groundwater differs amongst the hydrologic settings. In the freshwater lens setting, saltwater rise and encroachment, reduction of groundwater discharge to the ocean, and also to springs where there's cap rock, are the principal consequences that are going to limit groundwater availability in that area. For dike-impounded and thickly saturated aquifers, the principal consequences limiting availability include water level decline and reduction of discharge to streams and springs. For upgrading aquifers such as the Schofield Aquifer, Schofield high-level groundwater would be reduction of flow to adjacent aquifers. These consequences depend on the magnitude of the withdrawals and can change with changes in recharge caused by land use or climate. Collaboration between management and science can work towards a balance between groundwater withdrawal and the need to limit the consequences. This study demonstrated how groundwater modeling can help quantify the consequences of groundwater withdrawal for a certain set of situations. If water managers have a certain set of limits that they don’t want to overstep, science can run scenarios to figure out what the available groundwater is under those limitations or, alternatively, if...stakeholders have estimates of how much water they would like to have, models could be run to quantify what the consequences of that  taking that water would be. And that is all I have. Thank you.",0,B2,07/26/2023

"Yeah. Thank you for the presentation. It's good to see it a second time. I was wondering, Ryan Imata presented information on the deep monitoring wells last meeting, and the magnitude, I guess, of the changes of the transition zone seem pretty complex for  I think it was Pearl Harbor Aquifer. Ryan, are you there? And then looking at your, I think it was 2000 to 2010 model for O‘ahu, it looked like  I think it was the saltwater-freshwater boundary picture in the blue.",0,B2,07/26/2023

It looked like it had some really large changes on the order of feet  and I was justg if you could  it's a model and Ryan's data and have there been kind of efforts to take and caliber  calibrate the model with the deep water (inaudible).,0,B2,07/26/2023

"Effect of the 2010 withdrawal on  so this is relative to, yeah, shutting them all off.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Oh, to shutting them off.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Yeah, yeah. Okay, so  so the way we did it is we took the calibrated model, which had all of those wells operating",0,B2,07/26/2023
"and pumping, and then to see what would happen if they did not exist, we shut them all down, and then we did the comparison. So this is the result of having those wells pumping.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Okay, yeah. It's a backwards",0,B2,07/26/2023
"So this is a  kind of an imagined scenario of if we  if we stopped pumping, is that",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Right. And the reality was that the wells went in, you know, over time, right?",0,B2,07/26/2023
They didn't just all happen.,0,B2,07/26/2023
"Okay. Okay, so when Ryan said the transition zone has been stable from  you know, over the last, I don't know, 20 years or so or period of record, we  they aren't really comparable to this image, I guess. That's all I'm saying. I'm just trying to clear my thinking was like they were used  that data was used to build the model, but that data and this image do not line up, and I shouldn't compare them, right?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Well, there  yeah. There are things that are gonna make the model  you know, it's a model, but it's gonna make it difficult  well, there are gonna be challenges for matching actual data, but that doesn't mean it's  you know, that you should throw out one or the other. But one of the things is that this is a steady-statemodel, so there is  this is what will happen ultimately if the 2001 to 2010 conditions were kept steady forever. It  there's no time dimension on this simulation. So I couldn't say that this would happen in a hundred years or ten years or 20 years or something like that.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"And  yeah. And the other thing is that that  that also means that the wells didn't go in a  in the way that they actually did, you know, over time. Oh, the other thing that I wanted to say is so the change in the freshwater-saltwater interface is going to increase  it's going to  the change is gonna happen quickly at the beginning and slow down as you approach the  you know, the steady state. The  it may be very difficult to see changes as the  as these freshwater  as this  as the system settles into a new steady state. And the third thing is that, most likely, the aquifer is not at its steady state because new wells are being put in all the time, right?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Okay. Larry, your hand is up. Go ahead.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Yeah. How does this affect current estimates of sustainable yield, and what's the timeframe in which we'd have to change them?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Well, I guess my  my take on thsustainable yield issue is that for this  the things that  the consequences that limit the availability of water from any particular aquifer is going to be different because  depend on its hydrologic system. So, in this case  let me get the pointer out so that  so in the freshwater lenses, things like water table or the saltwater-freshwater interface or the depth of the transition zone will be very important. But, you know, when you look at things like dike-impounded groundwater and, you know, in  on O‘ahu or Kaua‘i, or the thickly saturated aquifers, it's probably going to be streamflow because at some point, you know, as the managers of Hawai‘i's groundwater, someone will probably ask you, Well, can you limit the amount of streamflow reduction in  you know, in my area? And that's going to become the limiting factor. It's not gonna be saltwater rise anymore. So then, you'll have to assess the availability of groundwater for dike-impounded areas based on that criterion. So also  already changes, I think",0,B2,07/26/2023
But that's not really my question. My question is that,0,B2,07/26/2023
"I see that sometime in the future, even though there's resistance to it, is that you're gonna have to move water around. Like, for example, on the island of O‘ahu, you can't go by aquifer-specific use like Now, for example, I know there's resistance on the Windward side to be able to transfer water to the Leeward side if they start getting short. So I'm more interested in not aquifer-specific water, but how would that affect the availability of water across the whole island? And in the practical consequence of your research, is it not gonna make any difference or do we have to worry about that in the future?",0,B2,07/26/2023
I think the approach to assessing groundwater availability has to take into account these consequences. I guess I'm not understanding the question 'cause I thought that's what you were asking.,0,B2,07/26/2023
"Well, let me simplify my question. How is your research gonna impact what we consider available sustainable yield? Is it not gonna have any consequence? Or if not, what is the purpose of your research?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Oh, okay. So what I have shown, the research has shown that as managers, you're trying to determine the amount of water availability for human use, but there are also other uses that you are trying to balance them with, right? So in order to get to that answer, you have to consider things that are appropriate for those situations. For those settings, for the dike-impounded groundwater or freshwater lens, it's gonna be a different  different set of limiting circumstances. So the study that I have done, the study that we've done, it's a group of people, demonstrated that we can use things like groundwater modeling, we can also have other kinds of studies that can assess, that can quantify the impacts of groundwater  of groundwater withdrawal and that will then, in turn, help you determine what the groundwater availability is. So it's a  it's kind of a question, a chicken-and-egg question. To know how much groundwater is available, we first  the scientists need to know first how much change are you willing to accept? How much of a consequence are you willing to accept?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Okay. I guess I'm not getting through to you. What I want to know is that based on what you've been presenting, are we gonna have to change the sustainable yield of the aquifers, like, for example, on O‘ahu?",0,B2,07/26/2023
I think you will have to change the method.,0,B2,07/26/2023
"And then my secondary question on that was, what was the timeframe of that change?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"As  okay, that is  I guess that's  would be a groundwater management problem.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Yeah. You know, because, for if we have the Pearl Harbor Aquifer at X amount of million gallons, as we take it down  if we take it down further down, I assume that you're gonna already have to change the sustainable yield as you get closer to the maximum because you're having saltwater uprisings, etc., or decreased streamflow or no more watercress forming in Pearl City. So that was my question, is that what would you estimate the timeframe in which we start to have to consider reducing sustainable yields?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Okay. That isn't  again, the model is not capable of  it's a steady-state model, so it doesn't have a time element in it, so it won't tell you how much longer you have. Models can be done  can be created to do that, but these models were not and takes a lot more data than we had.",0,B2,07/26/2023
But if  but if one of your  one of your scenarios was increased withdrawals.,0,B2,07/26/2023
"So it seems to me that if that's one of your models and you could come up with an estimate, that would be a direct relationship to how much of a sustainable yield has to change, correct?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"It  yeah. Well, it would  it would tell you what the result  it would tell you what the result of changing the pumping rate is, but it doesn't tell youwhether it's sustainable because it depends on how much the water managers, and I'm thinking that's you, that's the water commission, how much of the consequence of doing that you are willing to accept. Because we saw that by doing those scenarios, we saw that it caused the freshwater lens to get thinner, it caused some streams to go  to have less stream discharge, some springs to have lower discharge. So is that an acceptable  without the answer to what's acceptable, it's virtually impossible for the scientists to tell you how much is available.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"So you're saying, then, that we decide sustainable yield when we start seeing negative effects? Because, you know, when I was on the water commission, we had sort of crude models for figuring out what sustainable yield or  was it Mink and  I can't remember.(Inaudible comments.)",0,B2,07/26/2023
"So are we still  if we're still dependent on that and the only way that we would change the sustainable yield is if we start seeing  we're topping off and we're gonna start seeing negative effects like we did on the ‘Iao Aquifer on Maui a couple of decades ago. So  oh, okay.",0,B2,07/26/2023
I'm going to (inaudible) th,0,B2,07/26/2023
"too, Commissioner Miike. I think, you know, this is one dataset we use as staff to come up with recommendations on any adjustments to sustainable yield and the timeframe for that. There is another study that's being  hopefully gonna get published by the end of this year, which is the impact of climate change on recharge. So there's the recharge values, there's this  the hydrology evaluation, these different hydrologic conditions, and scenarios that we have to consider. And as you mentioned, the sustainable yield and the RAM model is  crude, right? It has a lot of assumptions built into it. And so part of our challenge, I think, working with Ryan and his groundwater team, working with Ayron and Dean with surface water, is to look at this more comprehensively. Maybe just to  for clarification, Scot, you know, in your maximum pump scenarios, which looks at future increases, is that based on pump capacity, or was that based on water use permit allocations because we're in a groundwater management area?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Yeah, it was on permit allocations.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Yeah, yeah. I got it from (inaudible).",0,B2,07/26/2023
"So just getting to your  towardmanagement on Oʻahu, because we're a groundwater management area except for Waiʻanae currently. Another management tool is the ability to shift allocations, reduce allocations where we may see potential impacts based on these additional studies or that could be a recommendation that we as staff look at based on this new data. So we had set a sustainable yield, we allocated based on that sustainable yield, but with this additional data and information, we may need to revisit those allocations if those impacts to springs, shorelines discharge, or other types of protected public trust uses are impacted. We might need to re-evaluate that, so (inaudible).",0,B2,07/26/2023
"So we wouldn't so much change the sustainable yield, but, rather, we would change allocations?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"There could be both. It could be multipronged. I think a lot of the data that  and partnerships we've had with USGS on a lot of this research  and, you know, UH is jumping on board with Water Resource Research Center's work. We can come at it both ways. I think the commission has adopted historically a very conservative approach to sustainable yield and always picked the bottom of these ranges. The commission could open that box up, right, and look at where there's a high demand and there's this range, and if we're not seeing impact, do we want to create a range of sustainable yield and adjust it that way? Again, we  it is a management tool that I think can be revisited and looked at in a way  you know, region or hydrologic unit by hydrologic unit, it could be moku by moku, it could be island by island. Like you're suggesting, if we're needing to shift water resources around Oʻahu  we're having a presentation by Board of Water Supply right after this on East Honolulu Watershed Management Plan, so I'm curious to see how maybe builds off of some of these conversations about how water is utilized on this island considering the built physical environment of this  you know, the board's infrastructure. I think it  it should be both strategies, but that's something that we'd have to bring up and recommend to you folks. As our policy setters, what do you want to see pursued moving forward?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Any other questions? I have one, Scot. On your summary, you talked about major changes, and you included climate change; what  in your mind, what is that? Is that the sea level rise and greater salinity? I mean, what were you thinking of? Because with the accelerated climate change, does this modeling get impacted by that?",0,B2,07/26/2023
The thing that we looked at in the modelas far as climate change was the change in precipitation.,0,B2,07/26/2023
"Yeah, not sea level rise.",0,B2,07/26/2023
But that is a consideration. I think there are other people researching that.,0,B2,07/26/2023
"Okay, all right. Thank you. Aurora.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Thanks for this. I just was wondering, is there a way that we can dynamically explore scenarios for planning, or does it have to be run—do we have to—does the commission staff need to give you the parameters? Do you have to run it and give it back, or will there be a future way where we can say play plan or play God a little bit and say if this happens, what happens in Ko‘olau? If we change this dial, what happens to these different response variables?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"You know, that is a really good question because that is something that the USGS and, you know, else—throughout the USGS, nationwide, is kind of thought about because for us—you know, as you say, if you—the water commission came up with this scenario and you wanted us to test it, then we'd run the model and then we'd write a report and then, you know, so many years later you get the report",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Kind of a  Yeah, and we understand that. So one of the things that has been explored  excuse me. Unfortunately, I don't know what the current status of it is, but was somehow getting the ability of the users, that includes the public, to run certain things on groundwater models because that's really what I think the value of the groundwater model would be. So you could say, Okay, I'm gonna put wells in here and here and here, put it on Nyx, say, and I think they have explored things like web-based  you know, a web-based tool that does that. And then, because groundwater models take a while to run  and that's gonna change because things are gonna get faster and faster and faster. But anyway, because groundwater models take a while to run back then when they were trying these things, they would have the  my understanding is that they would have the results ready for you at a certain time, and then they would send you a text and say, Okay, here's your results. So, you know, maybe it might take a couple days for the groundwater model to run that scenario. But anyway, scenario testing should, I think  I would  just looking into the future, it's probably  and it might not happen in my career, but I would think that that would be something that could be done.ady explored doing it. And sorry, did that answer your question?",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Well, it's discouraging to hear that it might not be during your career, and maybe there's ways to make that happen sooner. Unless you're planning to retire soon.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"Maybe that's  maybe that was a hint that I was gonna  no, but anyways, yeah. (Laughter.) It's  you know, it's possible for that to happen.",0,B2,07/26/2023
"I think the technology's already there. There needs to be a customer for it, and I think, you know, there is, and then someone to provide that product, and I think the USGS could do that.",0,B2,07/26/2023
Any other questions? (No response.) Is there anybody in the room that wants to make a comment on this? (No response.),0,B2,07/26/2023
"Anybody on Zoom? Kathy, is there anybody  Abbey and Franz are here for  is it B",0,B2,07/26/2023

"Mr. Dean Uyeno, SPAM Program Manager, CWRM Mr. Uyeno apologized for the delay in the submittal of the permit application for after-the-fact stream diversion works. He provided an addendum to correct some information and requested to replace the original application with a revised one. The landowners for the diversion intakes are unknown, and the applicant will need to follow all current rules and regulations with the new landowners if identified in the future. The State historic preservation division has no objections to the ongoing use, although recommends the property owner hiring an archaeological consultant to develop a plan for the continued preservation for the Haia terrace system. The commission found that the applicant violated certain regulations but recommended no fines be imposed. The applicant worked with commission staff to comply with the current permit process. The approved stream diversion works permit is for 9000 gallons per day for two acres of dry land kalo and one acre of diversified agriculture from the Kahoma stream subject to standard and special conditions.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"If the commission approves this, are we allowing commercial use for traditional and cultural native Hawaiian practices?",1,C1,03/21/2023
"The applicants will be able to speak better to this portion. Their agriculture, which does provide for home use in a sense of bartering in a traditional customary way and some are being used for commercial sale. So, there is a twofold use.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"I do understand the rationale because we are trying to streamline the permits, traditional and cultural. We know the issue of commercial use is out there and currently it’s not allowed. I believe if we approve this, we state somewhere in the recommendation that this is an ongoing issue, and we don’t want to set a precedence that then will be used by other people.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"I think you bring up a good point. What we have been trying to do at the staff level is to work with the applicants. In this case, a majority of the use is for subsistence purposes and traditional customary practices. It’s a policy and balance that the commission must consider. But your right, traditional andcustomary practices do not include commercial use.",1,C1,03/21/2023
Maybe we need a statement saying this does not provide a precedence for any commercial use in any future applications.,1,C1,03/21/2023
"One of the things we always advise is that you have the series of facts before you and this is specific to this permit application. We did highlight it in the submittal that staff, based on prior direction from the commission look at ways to help support traditional customary practices of native points in the permitting process. Whether an expedited or an exempted process is something we should pursue. I think this is related to the Alima Huli violation, which was very similar where a pump was put into the stream but supported traditional kalo cultivation. We are trying to balance with staff. Is one dollar worth of commercial the trigger or is it absolutely zero? Is it a range? We are using our best judgement in this context to provide a recommendation for you to consider, but this is a decision of the commission.",1,C1,03/21/2023
I think the minutes should show the discussion that we are having in which should protect us in the future. Because what is the level of commercial use? I’m not against Farmer’s markets and landowners selling things for some sort of income.,1,C1,03/21/2023
Great question commissioner Buck and great response Kaleo. Are you in consultation with Kahuliao and the Native Hawaiian scholarship team at the Richardson school of law? They may have some thoughts on these rights and how they evolve in the current state.,1,C1,03/21/2023
"We’ve been in contact and coordination with Kahuliao and others including our legislators, who have policy conversations about it. Last session, there were amendments to the Water Code that started to articulate. For example, licenses on kalo growing in a traditional customary manner. There was a conversation about whether commercial kalo farming would also qualify for that exemption from water licensing. There's also another indication on a policy level that this dialogue between what policy stance the state should take. I use kalo as an example, of a traditional customary practice. We are working with anybody to look at the evolution of the code on its application to our modern times. Some of the things we are looking at is an evaluation of the intent. In some of the reviews, on the commission reports it already starts to anticipate one of the recommendations which was to exempt all traditional customary practices from having to get a permit from us. They are still required to get a permit from us so we’re trying to balance between what is and isn’t required.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"There has been legislation proposed this session regarding traditional customary practices and commercial use. It has been the position of the Department in our testimony that under article 12 section 7 it specifically says not for commercial use. We have taken the position that it is just for subsistence purposes. We understand it is an evolving issue. We are taking the position that traditional customary practices do not include commercial use and we were successful in getting proposed legislation to delete that. That’s a question probably far beyond at this point and time. Unless we change the law, we may be drawing a thin line but I think one that we’re holding to that it has to be traditional customary practices for subsistence use. Priority purposes of issuance and public trust, traditional customary practices may have a priority clearly over commercial use. But currently that is the Department’s position.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"it’s a complicated issue but subsistence back in the day meant you traded kalo for fish. Today, you got to pay property taxes you got to pay for cultural consultant to subsist. It’s a difficult issue and I appreciate that the consideration is being made. I have a question for Ohana Guth, do you perceive that the retention of an archaeological consultant can get expensive and is that going to pose a burden on your ohana of users?",1,C1,03/21/2023
"absolutely. We got a quote from SMS, and they want to charge us $11,500 plus airplane fare and car rental and last year we made $25,000. You guys are talking commercial but we are providing food for our kupunas. We do 2 farmers markets a month, that’s it, that’s all we can handle. We are in our 60’s and we farmed almost 40 years of our life. Saying that we have water going through the Haia terraces down to our property all of that is untrue.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"Did any of this Haia terrace extend to Kamehameha schools land? Is it in that vicinity or is it off their land? Could it be that Kamehameha, who has land in that area, may have done some landscape level archaeological reviews? They may be able to provide you with access to that information. I would encourage outreach to the school who’s done a lot of research on their land and the surroundings.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"I’d like to share a little bit about my background. I am a lineal descendant. My maiden name is Akiona. My father was Albert Kauhilani Akiona, his mother was Mabel Mahoe Akeo Akiona, and her mother is Ella Papiweloa Haia Kekai. Her father is Haia Kekai. So that Haia terraces are family to me. I would never desecrate any of the burials or the land. All we are doing is farming.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"Kaleo, perhaps our staff could help facilitate the access of the information. So that it’s acquired through somebody that you have to retain at their expense, which would be a burden to them. We might be able to get that information in other ways. We might be able to provide the assurance to SHPD that the sites are being adequately protected from use and not a threat to the sanctity of the sites.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"Can I also give you a little history of our history with SHPD? When we first purchased the property in 2020. We began the application process with Rebecca Alakai. Item 34 on the application was to reach out to SHPD and we did. Again, this was in 2020 when covid was full blown. I talked to Andrew McAllister, and he told me they weren’t doing site visits because of covid so, we marked that on our application. We navigated our way through the application, which was difficult. But Rebecca helped us and in November we finally had it all to the place where they deemed it complete. We submitted it and the following year in 2021 we were actually on the agenda a few times but got taken off because they decided they needed to look a little deeper into our application. They suddenly became aware of our association with the Haia terraces. I let them know that we are very familiar with it because it’s my wife’s ohana. In fact, she has family buried up there as recent as her father’s siblings that died at birth. There were 11 children but two of them had died and were buried in Keoihuihu which is the area. They let us know that they had a new website and that we had to navigate that now, so we did. In November of 2021, we finally got that completed and in January they said that they completed the review and that we needed a letter from the government agency who requested the review. We let CWRM know and at that time we were told that they were super busy, and they would get to it, so we left it at that. That was in January 2021 and then in May of 2021 we received a letter from Kathy Yoda with a new form that the State Historic Preservation was putting out there for people to use. He asked that we use that. I explained that we already went through the review, and they said they never got a determination letter. I asked well did you ever send that letter in that they asked for? They said they forgot. So, they sent it to me. I had to upload it and send it to SHPD. I sent in that new form and what it did was it generated a whole new review. So, this was in June that I got this new review submitted. We waited and waited and kept calling because it was holding up our application. Then SHPD finally, in last November, tells us that they cannot do a review of our property because it’s an after the fact and according to their books we’ve already unearthed the area and they show it in their pictures that we have a stream diversion on that side of the stream and water flowing through the Haia terraces, that is totally false. We have six land commission awards, two on one side of the stream and four on the other. The two on one side of the stream are accessible for us to drive, to do our work during covid. It was perfect because we had six grown kids and their families, and everybody came and helped us clear the land and plant kalo. It was a special time for us. We didn’t do anything across the stream, which is where four more land commission awards are. The Haia terrace property is adjacent to ours on top of the hill. We are down at the stream area and they are on top of the hill. This is the land where Kahoma stream and Kanaha stream merge. It goes up about 200 feet and that’s where the Haia property terrace is. For them to say that we have a diversion in which we don’t, and that we have water going through the terraces, is so unbelievable. There’s nothing we can do about it because they never came out to visit. We wanted them to do a site visit, but they never did. In fact, I could barely get a hold of them since they sent the determination letter saying they’re going to recommend to CWRM that we get denied. I wrote to Dean that I’m just flustered. I don’t know what to do. I appreciate Dean and his willingness to try. He came out there with Alexa and Ayron and they could see that we hadn’t done anything over there. It’s still in its natural state. There’s no reason why SHPD cannot come out and do a study to see if the terraces are being impacted or will be impacted by any type of cultivation or planting. There’s nothing we have done there except build a bridge that goes from one bank to the other, that’s all. Now they want us to call a consultant. We called several and finally one answered. The expenses for the consultant, the car and airfare is $12,000. All we want to do is grow food. I have a degree in Agriculture from the University of Manoa and ever since we’ve been married in 1984, we’ve always done some sort of subsistent farming out in Honokohau and now we are continuing to do this up here. We make kulolo and sell it at the farmer’s market. We were making poi for a while, but the Board of Health said we can’t because we don’t have a commercial kitchen unless we pound the poi by hand. I tried but it’s too hard. We should not have to go to the private sector and empty our bank account.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"It seems like SHPD’s position may be based on misinformation and the lack of ground truthing site visit, rather than kind of take an easy path for a state agency to have the applicant prove something at their expense. Is there a way we can get this clarified? And avoid that expense which would be a burden.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"Commissioner Hannahs, you know what I’m going to recommend. Do you know Hinano Rodrigues? He’s our Cultural and History branch chief on Maui. I would ask that Hinano talk story and review SHPD’s letter with you and any changes that needs to be made. Hinano will have the opportunity to review this. Clearly you have a lineal connection to this land. I cannot imagine that you would in any way attempt to damage or desecrate your ohana that’s there. When we get down to the recommendations, that will be something that I will recommend, especially if he’s there on Maui. I think he would be in a better position to make an appropriate recommendation to SHPD regarding your particular activity. Commissioners, do you have any questions before I have the Guth’s have an opportunity to tell us? There’s any additional information?",1,C1,03/21/2023
Ayron Strauch from the Stream Protection Management Branch. Dr. Strauch explained that staff with the Stream Protection Management Branch conducted multiple site visits and provided photographs for context.,1,C1,03/21/2023
"Let me just be clear. The terrace system, from what I understand is an agricultural system. There’s also been an intermixing of burials language in the conversation. After talking with SHPD and the Guth’s the burials are located up mauka. So, the burials aren’t going to be impacted but under Historic Preservation law we have an obligation to protect archaeological sites especially, if they are registered. I think that is the extent of the comment that came from archaeological branch. So, I think your recommendation to have the culture and historic branch review this and provide additional recommendations to this body would be helpful. Even with lineal descendants that have claims. These are just larger wahi kupuna stewardship issues that we have to deal with wai throughout the state. There is a nexus here with the re-establishment of wai and traditional cultural sites before the water commission.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"sometimes we just have to use common sense and be practical. But Hinano is from the area, and we should give him an opportunity to visit the Guth’s if he hasn’t already and provide us with an assessment based upon a site visit based upon his own cultural and historical knowledge of the area. Doing a site visit will give him a better appreciation for what you are doing in relationship to these particular sites. He knows that your activities is going to be further makai from where the historic sites are, out of harm's way of both the burials as well as the features. So, let's see what he says. I think Hinano takes into consideration people's lineal connection. I mean not in any way disregarding SHPD and the archaeologists, but I think this is one that merits cultural considerations. So, as we get to the recommendations let's explore. Ayron It’s 11:20, The Guth’s would you like to provide any overview of what you’re doing before we take a break? I know there are people here who’ve either provided written comments or would like to provide oral comments.",1,C1,03/21/2023

We love it we always have, and we hope that our kids and grandkids that come up there, enjoy it and carry this on as well. We try to grow as many things that we can eat and don’t like to grow anything that we don’t like to eat. But we do enjoy eating what we grow. Our papayas, bananas, our kalo. And We’ve planted a lot of mango trees and this year they’re starting to flower for the first time and give fruit. We have a whole backyard down in Lahaina of plants and are excited to put in the ground fruit trees. That will help us to live off the land and for our family and grandchildren. So that’s our dream. We have our legacy lands that we will pass down to our children and hope our children will continue this legacy of farming the land and working the land.",1,C1,03/21/2023

I hope our children will continue this legacy of farming the land, working the land, that is what we've always done and something that we really enjoy.

"Mahalo to this commission once again for allowing me to provide my testimony. A lot of key things that came up in the discussion. Mahalo to Commissioner Buck for that question on Commercial uses. Which is not only missed and out of context many times. Everybody looked at just the basic concept of what that means. When you start talking about what kind of rights kuleana basically have versus people who purchase property. It’s different in my eyes. Mahalo to Kaleo for your mana’o and to you, Chair Chang for your knowledge and clarification of article 12 section 7. The Hawaii revised statute 7-1 on gathering rights. Subsistence gathering rights is not for commercial use. This HRS is from the Privy Council of 1850 and used as a system to clarify its uses. Based on what I heard then and how it kind of intermingled to today's policies. I'd like to mention that I am a recognized lineal descendant of Keoihuihu burial terrace known as the Haia Terraces which Kaleo corrected. The burials are lower, my mana‘o provided by Uncle Jonah Keahi is no longer with us. But a descendancy recognition came from State Historic Preservations site number 50 50-03-01776 and what I'm saying is that any further discussion that has to do with the State Historic Preservation division, to consider the recognize the lineal descendants as well, to be a part of the consultation. Not only myself, but also, there's two others that were recognized to the State Historic Preservation Branch and the Burial Council which is Namea‘aia Alpachino and Kahikilani Niles. Which is one that would recognize the lineal descendants. If any work or anything that even encroaches upon those areas should have some kind of consultation with recognize lineal descendants. There's a report that we have on the ongoing work for the Corps of Engineer back in 1974. In the last stage of the report it basically stresses the importance of their concluded recommendations. That any other work that is done within this area, which is not related to the Kahoma Stream Flood Project. When they were doing it back then, they had to take into serious consideration federal archaeological work needs to be justified. If necessary, to the Kahoma stream terraced area that was implemented in this archaeological plan that was done in 1974. There's another issue that I would like to also put on the table. There are multiple land commission awards in my records. I had three of them and the one that I have kuleana to is the land commission award of 8021 ʻāpana 1 royal patent 1732. There's another one by Nalehu which is another parcel. The information or 6621 Royal Patent 1722 issue to Nalehu. The Haia terrace is also mentioned in the osteological report that these areas are highly significant and also kuleana live in that area today. The Haia Terrace, where we are right now is in the process of putting together a lot of these applications for water to address these area. After the designation was made it was important for us to make sure that we are implemented in a plan. How we will be able to continue our kalo cultivation within the areas that I mentioned. The land commission award and the possibility of getting simple water up Haia terrace so we can start managing and beautifying the terrace area. Cutting the grass down so it’s eminent that we’re looking at what we actually protecting that’s a long management plan. I’m hoping to take into consideration that these things need to involve the recognized lineal descendants of the area. I also want to ask that tax map key 245-017:002 should be stricken to this request. This kuleana that we live on and if this plan goes forward what does it do for our application? There are other pending applications that are in this area that is in the process now for the water use permit. How is this going to impact or negatively affect the work that we’ve been doing? Because we call our designation those lands that have been cultivated. Even above in Kahoma with the repatriation of waters provided by Kamehameha schools we put water in the river to make sure that the kuleana had water or the ongoing cultivation of the taro. So the main request is to make sure that 245017.002 is stricken from this request because we live there and there was no permission by doing all these altercations going fast forward. Mahalo, for this opportunity I am here to answer any of your questions.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"Keaaumoku, are you familiar with the Guth’s?",1,C1,03/21/2023
I see them. I like the work that they're doing in the valley. I have no problem with that they're just certain clarification that I want to make sure that we're a part of. Especially when it comes to the consultation of the Haia terrace.,1,C1,03/21/2023
Do the lineal descendants meet regularly?,1,C1,03/21/2023
"We meet every Monday. We sit down and talk about the water use permit application. Because once the designation was made, I want to stress again that it's important for us to make sure that we lay down the ground rules, pertaining to what we can do and what we cannot do to provide clarity. This is not just Kahoma it's Kalaula going into the water use throughout Komohana. Komohana kuleana was the one that was vital to the state designation that we really thought we needed. Because we were being left out of the picture, so we supported the designation just for that back. May the record show that a lot of the purchases on West Maui Land company was not in support of the designation. This gives us more of an opportunity to be a part of the management system.",1,C1,03/21/2023
Is there an opportunity for the Guth’s to meet with the Ohana that meets regularly?,1,C1,03/21/2023
"I think that would be a possibility. I don't know it is depending on them. But I know eventually down the road, when there is some kind of consultation with the Historic Preservation that there will involve the lineal the newly recognized descendants.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"Okay, thank you very much Keaaumoku. With that do the commissioners have any questions?",1,C1,03/21/2023
"Aloha Chair Chang and Commissioners mahalo for this opportunity to speak. Aloha to the staff as well. I understand how much work went into helping the Guth’s get to this point in their application for theafter the fact permit. But there are a few things that really needs to be clarified there are other end uses that have been included in this application that I don't think should be included in this application. They should be considered on their own. Some of the tax map keys that were cited or at least included in the application initially. I'm not sure if it changed over time. Maybe it got revised. But at least what I'm seeing is as uncle Keaaumoku had mentioned there are several that should be stricken from the application. I feel like some other properties were snuck into somehow some way other people are currently residing in there that have their own diversions on the stream. And also taking water for domestic consumption as well. I'm not sure if that is included in their request. How much they can harvest from the from the river. Whether or not that is included in the Guth’s application. It's supposed to be used for agricultural use. There's a lot of reason to think that some of the people who are residing on adjacent lands have acquired those lands through the Land Company. They are also taking water from the river for domestic use and not necessarily for agricultural use. They have some agriculture but to me the extent is just to show that they're using that as an excuse to take water from the river. Before I go on. I have to clarify that I am a descendant of Emily Haia who owns the Haia terrace. That is her aina. She is my father's mother. I did not seek any lineal descendancy confirmation from any Boards or Commissions of the State. That is my grandmother's Aina so just to clarify I am a hoa‘āina of that place. I currently steward several acres in the valley for other Ohana as well. Land Commission 6621 to Nalehu as well as 8021 that uncle Keaaumoku had already mentioned in his testimony. I am one of the hoa‘āina of those lands. I have to add that I think SHPD presence in the valley is very necessary because it's not just the Haia Terrace. Everywhere you look in that valley there's significance and the fact that the valley was abandoned for so long for over 100 years. The plantations took the water after the overthrow of our kingdom the plantations took the water with the help from the diversion above Kahoma stream. They took the water away from the valley, our family left the valley eventually and the land has been sitting there abandoned for almost 100 years. So, a lot of those lands with respect to what was used by the plantations for sugar operations. I just think that there's other people who are acquiring lands through the Land Company that need to file their own applications. When it comes to the Guth’s application I feel like the Guth’s are extending their application to even include others who are not necessarily serviced by the Guth’s. They have their own diversions. The commission needs to consider that they have their own application reviewed.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"Aloha Commissioners and the Chairman. I've never watched a CWRM meeting before my apologies. I am testifying in favor of the Guth’s to get the permit. I am a lineal descendant of the original inhabitant of Kahoma Valley. My tutu was the Konihiki of Kahoma valley and I want to address a couple of things that I've heard. One of them being commercial use. I’m guessing that goes towards the Guth’s using their farm products. They sell it at the farmer's market. So my Ohana was in the valley until 1936 farming kalo. I have pictures and documentation to support this and around the early 1900s to about 1915 Lahaina had a POI Factory. There's documentation of this POI Factory from Lahaina restoration and my ohana sold their Kalo to that POI Factory. In turn my ohana worked also for that POI Factory they were POI Pounders and POI Baggers. They harvested, so there was commercial use coming out from Kahoma Valley from the late 1800s to about 1936 when they finally left the valley. I didn't know the Guth’s until about five years ago in 2018 is when I first met the Guth’s. Their kalo that they grow over there is absolutely amazing and absolutely beautiful they are at the very beginning of the valley. They brought the valley back to life that's what the Guth’s did. I mahalo them so much. I don't understand all the statutes that go into water rights for Kahoma stream. But what I do know because I did the title search for all of the kuleanas in the valley is that with each deed that got passed on. Water rights was passed on to the next person and hence they were passed on to Pioneer Mill then into Kahoma land and then to the Guth’s. I was doing some back research for the Guth’s. I live on Oahu. I came across a deed dated February 1st 1932. It's from Pili Kekai and his wife Marianne John Manuia Kekai who is a widower. They were the children of Kekai and Kekai was the son of Haia who was the original land holder of noncommissioned awards 6541 to Haia which includes the Haia Terraces. On this deed it says that intent to Grant unto Pioneer Mill company the right and privilege of taking any waters from said lands that may be developed in the course of said tunnel excavation and construction. So this particular deed is from that ohana giving Pioneer Mill access through their land for water that was coming from Honokōwai and Kahoma Valley itself. It has a different system of what that value was used for. I also want to bring up so I heard Kapali talking about diversions. Well Kapali's family is squatting on land they're squatting on Nalehu they have no claim to that aina and they are also diverting water. There's diversions in that Valley going all the way up to where Kamehameha schools put the water back in the stream which I am so thankful for. I 100 percent support that effort to make the stream run 100 percent. In regard to Neil Hannahs asking about KS. This area, Kamamalu owns the upper part of that flat part in between Kanaha and Kahoma. The tip is still owned by that Haia family. Kapali is correct his grandma is one of the owners of the Haia. I’ll summarize really quick the Guth’s, Naomi, especially she's a native tenant of Kahoma Valley. I don't think that she should have to apply for a permit but I understand that that is the law now. But based on her rights as a native Hawaiian and based on the fact that commercial use was used in Kahoma Valley to supply taro to the rest of Lahaina. They didn't just do it for free. Yes, there's bartering going around but bartering only went so far and there was monetary use monetary value given to the kalo that was grown in Kahoma Valley. I know that that's a really touchy situation, but I do think that they should be approved because what they are doing provides for all of the community of Lahaina.",1,C1,03/21/2023
Aloha Chair Chang and members of the Commission of Water Resources Management. My name is Eric Meade and I'm a student at the William S Richardson School of Law. In deference to the issues raised by previous testifiers which I believe should be addressed. I support a precedence of waiting of these fines because of the Constitutional priority of water use for traditional and customary native Hawaiian practices. I'm enheartened to hear that the commission is conscientious of the burdens that traditional and customary Native Hawaiian practitioners face. Thank you.,1,C1,03/21/2023
"I have a question for Deputy Manuel and Ayron Strauch. Clearly this is an intense situation among neighbors and people who are connected to each other and in same space. But just focusing on what we’re responsible for as the water commission. I’m curious your view on if we approve this after the fact permit, what precedent does it set for both all the hard work we’ve been working on with IIFS and enforcement and the fact that we designated Lahaina as a water management area? We tried, we were leveraging penalties on Olowalu and yes this is a different case but it’s clear from testimony that people value the work of the Guth’s - that’s not the issue at hand.. What we are talking about is the water. So how does this affect our responsibilities to steward resources and mediate conflict? Sorry two things, let’s just focus on stewarding the resource for the stream and the precedence we set as we’re going to be rolling out(inaudible).",1,C1,03/21/2023
"I’ll start then Ayron and Dean can jump in. The use that’s described and the quantity that’s described has been evaluated against IFS as indicated in the presentation or the submittal. But the Guth’s are located at the mouth of the valley. So a lot of the other users that have testified are located mauka of them so they wouldn’t necessarily be impacted by the Guth’s diversion of water. The stream does and will continue to flow and the use per Ayron’s analysis is de minimus. I will say within the context of the Commissions regulation of water resources with designation coming forward. This diversion works permit is one process the Guth’s will still have to apply for a water use permit. There’s opportunities for the commission to further evaluate and balance the Guth’s water use with all the other water uses in the valley for in stream and off stream users. So, it’s one step to try to quote unquote clean up the files but the water use permitting process that’s coming this summer, the Guth’s will still have to apply for a water use permit and the commission will reevaluate and balance those reasonable beneficial uses at that time with all other users of this water of Kahoma stream.",1,C1,03/21/2023
Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani in this case once the water was restored in Kahoma valley from the Kamehameha school’s diversion. There was a lot of people that we found out that began diverting water from the stream and that’s something that we’re trying to work through to follow up on. In the case of the Guth’s it’s our understanding that West Maui Land company began selling off land commission awards that are part of a bigger TMK parcel. Some people that are adjacent to the Guth’s begun diverting water from the stream via smaller pumps. Those are some follow up actions that we’ll need to work on. The Guth’s to our understanding is going through a subdivision process. I believe that their LCA’s that they purchased from West Maui Land are in the process of receiving their own TMK parcel numbers and they may be able to speak to that more.,1,C1,03/21/2023
Just to take a broader view. The establishment of interim in stream flow standards to support in-stream uses and repairing uses downstream anticipated the use of water in the riparian zone. The resurgence of traditional customary practices the rejuvenation of ecosystems. We knew this was likely to happen. We just hope that all of these repairing users that are diverting water will go through the necessary legal channels to re- establish those structures if there's actual structures in the channel or pumps. So we kind of anticipated this might happen. Does that help?,1,C1,03/21/2023
"Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani- It helps I just want to add a final comment. I think as a commissioner and as kanaka ‘ōiwi, though not from Maui, what I don’t want to do is produce conditions that are going to increase local conflict without a pathway to working through them. We open up a resource and that's stimulating really good things but also there's these people who've been waiting for generations to get access to that and it feels like somebody's jumping in line. I guess if I were to make a motion right now I would want to defer a little bit. Make sure we sort of sort out our understanding of those TMK’s and LCA’s and get people together. Kaleo you've been working at that already but maybe I just want to put that out there because I think people have been waiting long. I'll just leave that comment.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"I appreciate that and as a planner and as somebody that similar to chair that supports process is something that I encourage and support. However, we are regulatory body and what we have before us is a request for a permit. I'm trying to honor the applicants process and request and process it within the context of our authorities. A lot of what you talk about is community building and community conversations and to be honest I don't feel comfortable being the one always forcing these conversations to happen. We recommend it. We highly encourage it. We could recommend consultation with, but making things subject to gets really challenging in this context. I hear what you're saying. I hear the testimony from all parties I am working with staff and the applicants trying to present to this to commission what's within our authority and within our space to help facilitate. There's larger systems and policies of how we better encourage community conversations but at this point as cited in the submittal this has been a permit that's been languishing for years. We want to help support especially in this context. Where we have somebody that's doing kalo cultivation customary practices as well as some commercial. But getting them across that finish line to create some hope for movement. That's just my response Commissioner. I honor you as a Commissioner and decision maker and we are here just to recommend decisions to you. Ultimately you make the decision, and we will follow your lead.",1,C1,03/21/2023
Kaleo can you help me with this? The application is for a stream diversions permit. Is that correct?,1,C1,03/21/2023
"the applicant, what is his legal access to that diversion?",1,C1,03/21/2023
"so, the diversion from what I understand, is a pump along the stream along their parcel.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"why is it that in the application, the landowner is unknown?",1,C1,03/21/2023
"There are two Parcels basically the stream channels. We've seen other instances and like Honokōhau Valley where that 888 parcel was the TMK Parcel. Were drawn up or digitized originally the 888 was a number sequence that was assigned to these parcels where no landowner was identified so it doesn't belong. It’s not identified as a state or the county, any government entity, or any private entity it's just these outlier parcels where ownership has not been identified.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"so, the occupancy and the maintenance of this diversion. Is it sort of a free for all?",1,C1,03/21/2023
"well, without doing an exact survey. The understanding is that the pump is on the parcel that the Guth’s own. The streams is these 888 parcels. I guess just the pipes would be going into the stream if that makes sense. Does that answer your question?",1,C1,03/21/2023
"well, what does the Guth’s enjoy any kind of long-term standing in maintaining that? or legal access to it?",1,C1,03/21/2023
that I'm uncertain just because there’ll be a land ownership issue there.,1,C1,03/21/2023
"well, I guess I mean have we granted these kinds of permits for lands with owner’s unknown to someone to have access to it?",1,C1,03/21/2023
I’m trying to recall if we did one in Honokōhau where the parcel was in a similar situation? Difficult for me to answer that question.,1,C1,03/21/2023
"I hear what you're saying right now. There's access the pump and the pipes are accessing the TMK which the stream is located on, and that stream is identified. There's no landowner identified so from our stance or at least in our initial review. We are recommending approval. Unless it's challenged, unless somebody does actually come forward and say that they're the landowner. Therefore permission should be sought through them. For example if it was a State of Hawaii right of entry to access that parcel. Would you have to be granted by the state? But because there's no landowner identified we don't have anybody to determine whether that access is allowed or not.",1,C1,03/21/2023
How much of this stream is in that 888 parcel?,1,C1,03/21/2023
I'd have to look Commissioner. Dean we'd have to pull up the TMK and analyze that.,1,C1,03/21/2023
"yeah, I'd have to do a closer look. But I think it’s in the vicinity. Just a rough guess, it's maybe a quarter mile section. There are other portions along the stream that are owned by private entities. For example, just upstream of this is owned by Kahoma land.",1,C1,03/21/2023
and another clarification for me as part of the application. The landowners of the three different TMK’s are listed? What is their participation in the diversion?,1,C1,03/21/2023
"The Guth’s maybe better to answer this but as far as we know the Guth’s are the only one’s operating their diversion. There are other pipes or pumps as we’ve seen during our site visits that have been in the stream at times. Between our first site visit to our last one, some of the pipes had changed there were different pipes where on our first site visit some of the pipes were in place, but they weren’t actually diverting either because they had been broken or I’m not sure if they were clogged. But there was no water in them at the time versus when we went this last time. There were additional pipes in the stream different from the ones we had seen prior, and pumps were observed.",1,C1,03/21/2023
And those were all in the 888 parcels?,1,C1,03/21/2023
"So again, the 888 is just a small sliver of the stream itself. The pumps that we observed was up on the bank so I'm not exactly sure which parcel that was on. I guess some of those pipes may have been in that 888 parcel.",1,C1,03/21/2023
Are there any other diversion permits other than the Guth’s?,1,C1,03/21/2023
"no, we need to follow up on these other diverters. It was kind of a messy situation initially. We didn't really understand what was going on as far as these individual LCA’s within this larger parcel that was being sold off and how we would treat those in that case. In the initial complaint when we looked up ownership we referred to it. I believe it was Kahoma land which is a subsidiary of West Maui Land company. We were talking with the president Peter Martin at the time and his response was, well we sold off these LCA Parcels so you need to talk to those people. So that's the situation we encountered early on.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"so, who could sort of provide a little more clarity on the landowners listed as end users? Kahoma Land Company is one of them.",1,C1,03/21/2023
we'd have to work with them to identify the owners through that that had purchased through them.,1,C1,03/21/2023
and the AG is comfortable about allowing us to issue diversion permits to someone that has no legal access?,1,C1,03/21/2023
"we haven't been consulted on that issue. If the commission requires advice, we'd want to look into it further.",1,C1,03/21/2023
it's just a matter of comfort. Are we providing the Guth’s with any kind of comfort by issuing a permit?,1,C1,03/21/2023
Hi Cindy a question quick question for you. I'm not an attorney and have you looked into the question of traditional and customary activities being the basis for commercial activity as is the case here. What we've heard earlier today that the law currently does not provide for that and somebody needs to change the law if they want to do that. It really comes to the commission to try to deal with that circumstance. What does the law say right now? Can you clarify that unequivocally for us?,1,C1,03/21/2023
I just need a minute. We haven’t taken a deep dive into that. I mean if that's your question?,1,C1,03/21/2023
Commissioner Meyer mahalo for the question. I think just for clarity. Staff in our review anybody can apply for extreme diversion works permit so that's what we're processing the analysis and recommendation related to TNC was typed defined. Whether or not we find what's tied to the fact that there's traditional customary practice. I want to bifurcate the conversation that the stream diversion works permits are not only limited to TNC so just making that clear for the record. Anybody can apply for stream diversion works permit but our intent to not fine is because the applicants participate in TNC as well as commercial. Based on that that's why we recommended not fining so that's the context of a TNC.,1,C1,03/21/2023
"I understand thanks very much Kaleo. At the same time, what it seems is that we're participating in a scheme to break the law that whether a fine is issued or not; the permit comes into question and question of whether a cease-and-desist order or cease and desist letter is appropriate. I'm not trying to be a hard guy or anything I understand the value out there and understand it pretty well. But I think we have a duty an irrevocable duty to follow the state code and unless somebody can change the law I don't know. Are we in a bind here seems like maybe we are.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"I understand it and I appreciate the clarification from Kaleo. The traditional customary practices; the question about commercial is only related to whether we decide to waive the fine or not. So that's separate because anybody's entitled to apply for a stream diversion permit. So, notwithstanding that, the Guth’s may be doing commercial activity. I think it’s the question of traditional customary practices is only related to whether we would waive the fine.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"it's ultimately the discretion of this body to decide whether to deny, accept, modify condition. This is your discretion and I think you are acting within the context of the water code to do that.",1,C1,03/21/2023
I'm sorry commissioner Meyer. Are you okay? Do you have any other questions? Are you comfortable?,1,C1,03/21/2023
"It seems to me that the question of the permit and the question about fine really is irrelevant given the statements in the code and the laws. I understand it as you explained it as a matter of fact. So, I am uncomfortable with this situation and I don’t like to be in position as a Commissioner; to be looking the other way if you will and by virtue by encouraging other people to do the same. To conduct the same kind of activity. So, I'm uneasy with that. I have been uneasy before and I don't think it seems like we're really doing our job as far as the law is concerned.",1,C1,03/21/2023
appreciate that perspective Commissioner. My understanding is the Guth’s have applied for the permit and so I don't think they're trying to violate; well it's an after the fact permit. But that permit has been pending the application.,1,C1,03/21/2023
"Staff we recognize that we've got a long list of things we need to accomplish in doing our work for this commission. And so, you want to dispense with items as they come before the board even though sometimes you don't have perfect information or absolute consensus, or the matter would benefit from community building. We're not resourced to support much more than the current level. We don't want to kick cans down the road where we're just not doing our job and making a decision with less than perfect information. But in this case, I just think there's some things that would benefit from a little bit more time. It's not just as we've said. It's not just for the value of this one permit. It sets some precedence that could be troubling if we move too precipitously. The whole SHPD issue. You've got the commercial use issue, you've got TMK identification issues, and questions which I'm not saying that the concerns are correct or not. It's just that they've been raised today, and I think we would really benefit from leaning in a little bit more on this to see if we can sort some of that out. I would say that with respect to the opportunity for community building. I guess I just kind of said it is an opportunity and not just a duty and that opportunity falls not just to our Commission staff but to the community itself. There are some reasonable people who have spoken on both sides of this issue here, before us today from our community and they're all impressive. Can you guys just talk and I hope the meeting works out so the Guth’s can go to the meeting that meets regularly on Mondays that Keaaumoku has talked about. I hope some of this stuff can get sorted. I hope that our SHPD folks can make a site visit and it seems like we've got some low-hanging fruit that you know can be accomplished in a short order. If things fall out that this bring us closer to consensus and closer to clarity on the issues to address the concerns about precedent setting that may produce unintended . I think we are better off. I don't know how that jams up future schedules of work for the staff or for the agendas of this Commission. But it just feels like we would benefit from a little bit more time and having this come back to us.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"Mahalo for that wisdom, Commissioner Hannahs are you proposing a motion?",1,C1,03/21/2023
I’d like to hear the staff’s response to that and then perhaps offer a motion.,1,C1,03/21/2023
"I’ll start I’m hearing the sentiment of the Commission as a decision-making body. I'm going to defer and work with the applicants and the community through some of the issues identified. I will say on some other questions raised about ownership and legal issues we'll consult with our AG’s, but I don't know how long or how fast that's going to take, and we can coordinate with SHPD as well. I had no control over them as a sister agency. So, I will say that I am concerned that we're going to continue to move this out and that the Guth’s have been applicants in this process since 2018. So, I just want to acknowledge them for their patience through this process if we decide to defer.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"I can give some general information about article 12 section 7. It's basically what chair Chang said. It's reaffirming that the state protects all rights customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence and right of cultural and religious purposes by ahupua’a tenants for descendants of Native Hawaiian. Just to remind you of the provision in your water code which is 174 C -101 that also talks about Native Hawaiian water rights. It doesn't really go to this specific issue but it does talk about Native Hawaiian rights. So, a deeper dive would be needed to answer your specific question. I wanted to give you kind of the framework that the Constitutional provision and your own statute provides.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"We know that there are unpermitted diversions across the state not just in Kahoma. We are trying to get them on the books as rapidly as possible. We've been working with the Guth’s and they've been patient with us for five years. They've been moving forward the fastest trying to get their use or their withdrawal of water legal in a sense. As mentioned, upstream of them or at least four other locations. We have documented water withdrawals from the stream that haven't been issued stream diversion works permits. This is just the permit for them to take water. This isn't an allocation of water; this isn't a judgment per se. Just that their use of water is reasonable. That's all I wanted to say.",1,C1,03/21/2023
Just to follow up that the Guth’s have been patient. They have been greatly cooperating to get to this point. I understand that deferring may be a good option just because of these other issues. These other diverters that Ayron mentioned will face similar issues in all likelihood; and to me it makes sense to work through these issues before you folks make a decision; and bring it back to the Commission at a future date.,1,C1,03/21/2023
The issue for instance. Commercial use could take a long time. I'm not sure you're going to get some counsel on that but I'm not sure we want to wait until you totally work that issue through. I mean there's an issue here for the Guth’s benefit we need time to get SPHD over there. Because right now you're looking at a recommendation that requires you to hire a cultural consultant and that's not necessarily what I've heard you want to do; although you can speak for yourself on that issue. I think there's a benefit for you to have us take this time to work through some of these issues; and if you're amenable to that unless you see a great hardship you can speak to this issue of a deferral.,1,C1,03/21/2023
"We’re fine with it. Yes, we’re willing to work with SPHD if they’re willing to come over. We would love them to do it.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"well, our chair is very persuasive, and she seems to know a guy. So, I think we can make that happen. Chair I would like to move that we defer item C-1. Kaleo is two months good? Have it come back to us within two months so it's not an endless thing?",1,C1,03/21/2023
I wouldn't put a time frame on it just because some of the issues that you brought up might take longer; and I don't know if we can resolve it in two months. We can shoot for two months but that would be May.,1,C1,03/21/2023
we won't be looking for perfect information and total resolution of every single issue. But at least let's take care of the low-hanging fruit that we can resolve; if we can defer this matter to address the concerns that have been raised at this hearing and then bring it back to us as soon as practical.,1,C1,03/21/2023

"I think it's headed in the right direction. I would like to ask that we ask the AG's office for clarity on the question of commercial use, and if possible on a priority basis. It seems like it's a narrow enough issue at this point, that somebody ought to be able to write a memo on that and give us proper legal advice; promptly. But I don't know that lies with the AG's office. I'll be happy to support this. I would like to condition this resolution on an opinion from the deputy AG's office.",1,C1,03/21/2023
"as a practical matter, pending the final approval or action by the Commission. What happens to the Guth’s? The existing diversion do they continue to use it not use it?",1,C1,03/21/2023
"We haven't issued a cease and desist so, a lot of that has to do with crops that have already been planted; and working with them you know, trying to be flexible with a party that's making an effort to comply. If we did do that; there would be lost of crops and so forth so, again from looking at it holistically, the quantity being requested the quantity being used isn't drying up a stream. It isn't necessarily affecting downstream users so at this point in time we're not recommending them to stop using water.",1,C1,03/21/2023
there's no doubt that they have been extremely patient and that they've not intentionally delayed the process. They have been trying very hard to comply and unfortunately government is not moving as quickly as we would all like.,1,C1,03/21/2023

"Aloha Chair Chang and Deputy Manuel and fellow Commissioners. On behalf of our board we just wanted to mahalo DLNR for their partnership in this project. This project is not just about the fishpond, it's about all of Maunalua Bay. We strongly believe that the return of the wai will help to bring back the health along with other community projects throughout Maunalua that'll bring back the health of the bay so that it'll bring back our natural resources and bring back our cultural practices. The practices of Aunty Laura and my tutu and all my aunties picking limu, my uncles fishing. Fortunately, I have cousins that still fish but we don't have the resources that we used to have but we hope that with projects like these our resources will become more plentiful and more of our current generation and our keiki will be able to practice richer experiences in our cultural practices in the future. That's what this project is about along with many other projects throughout our paeʻāina. We're very grateful for the support and we're very excited about what the future holds with a project like this and other projects throughout our paeʻāina. I know Jeannine is here if she'd like to say a few words as well.",1,B2,12/19/2023
"Aloha kākou. I would just like to say that my father was a lawaiʻa from Miloliʻi and when he got married and settled down and raised a family in Niu, we had so much fish every day practically. We were Catholics so we always had fish, but I clearly remember going with him and swimming in the bay and I always told people the ʻeleʻele limu, the ʻeleʻele would tickle my stomach when I'd be swimming because if you know our bay, the water there is very shallow. As a little girl I never wanted to step in it, I always wanted to swim above it and it was so plentiful. It was everywhere and it is not like that now. As you saw the pictures we only have the ogo and it's not good and when I think of returning the water to the bay, I think it would make my father very happy. Thank you so much for all the work that you do and we're so hopeful that this will do it.",1,B2,12/19/2023
"Thank you, Jeannine and I'm sure Aunty Laura is grateful for your perseverance.",1,B2,12/19/2023
"Aloha Chair Chang, aloha Commissioners, my name is Kimi Makaiau. I’m a newer resident to East Honolulu, moved into the area about 10 years ago and my family home is now in Niu Valley a couple hundred yards above Kalauhaʻihaʻi. I grew up on the North Shore and Jeannine just triggered a memory of when we used to go down to the beaches in Hauʻula and gather limu manauea, limu ʻeleʻele, wawaeʻiole and it was my job to come home and help clean the limu because it was mixed in with limu kala and all kinds of other things. When we moved into Niu Valley it was important for me, I come from a fishing family and to have my son raised and understand our resources, particularly of our marine resources. One of the blessings for us through the pandemic was that we spent a lot of time as a family across the street right in front of Kalauhaʻihaʻi so my son at the age of five got his first heʻe in that water, but unfortunately the limu is not present. It's my hope that this water is restored is that in the area that my son is being raised that he might one day be able to share in those same practices that I grew up with. We appreciate all the work that everyone has been doing, this really is a community-driven effort with the support and perseverance of the State. I really hope that this project can serve as a model for other communities to really get their resources back. It's a start for us, mahalo.",1,B2,12/19/2023
"I do want to provide context. Last week Friday the Land Board as the submittal said did approve DAR’s application to enter into a use and occupancy agreement with Department of Transportation so that the pipe can go underneath Kalanianaʻole Highway. When they were doing their highway widening they also condemned this parcel so the parcel was conveyed over to DLNR. DLNR does intend to enter into a longer-term lease with Maunalua Bay, the community organization to mālama this property. With Laura, Kaleo, myself and just our team really is looking to co-management to steward these resources. We could not have found better stewards than the ones that have been doing this for decades and who come from this area so that is our long-term goal here, but this is also a unique opportunity to try to restore this natural flow. We may have a similar situation in Lahaina, the restoration of Mokuhinia through a similar process as we're doing here, channeling that fresh water back into the areas that it used to flow in to restore that. We've got DAR, DAR is taking the lead because it is the restoration of a marine resource. Laura, first deputy's been helping to coordinate much of this but it is all of our different divisions working together, Engineering, CWRM, DAR, even OCCL and SHPD have played a role, but really the culmination of all of our divisions coming together with a community to steward this resource. It is something that I think all of us are extremely proud to be part of.",1,B2,12/19/2023
"Chair, I just join you and I thank you for your statement and really commend the community for their leadership and their really hard efforts to do this. It's not just a matter of, oh it's a cool thing to support. You're really helping us do our job as I mentioned in the earlier item before the Commission. We have a job to really preserve the life of the land and the culture of our people and we can't do it here in an office, it has to be done out on the land by a community who associate and have pilina to that land. That's who we're seeing before us today and it's a privilege to be in partnership with you and we're very grateful for all that you're doing to help us fulfill this constitutional obligation.",1,B2,12/19/2023
"I do have a question, I was wondering for staff, if we have the capacity or if the community groups or DAR has the capacity to track the progress of this effort. I don't know the time frame of it but to really be able to capture the before and after.",1,B2,12/19/2023
"David, I mean that's one of the reasons why DAR is involved in this. Maybe you can explain the role of DAR?",1,B2,12/19/2023
"Thank you, David Sakoda, DAR Fisheries program manager. DAR does have a number of estuary monitoring sites in Maunalua Bay and near Lucas Pond, Kalauhaʻihaʻi is one of them. We have baseline surveys and we plan to continue to monitor. We have cast net monitoring to look at the species assemblage and then we also have monitoring sites further out in the bay to track benthic cover and fish species and biomass. We will be monitoring and producing reports to understand how the bay is changing and I think this project will be a major part of whatever changes we might see.",1,B2,12/19/2023
"Kaleo, CWRM is also going to be doing some monitoring on the well?",1,B2,12/19/2023
"Usually there are meters put on wells when there's a pump in place but in this case there's no pump, we're looking at natural design. The design of this well is to recreate that horizontal flow so we're working with Engineering to figure out how to quantify, that’s to be determined. Once it gets put in we'll better understand if this actually works or not. Right now it's hypothetical, it's designed to work. We're hoping that it does but in the implementation we'll evaluate how to monitor that water use over time or what is flowing into the pond whether it's levels within the pond that we monitor at the end or within the actual well itself. If there's a way that we can install some monitoring equipment, working with Engineering so we're coordinating with them on the final design for monitoring. It's something we do want to figure out and track over time.",1,B2,12/19/2023
With BWS and Waste Management because they're showing us that water is still going into the sewer. With this pipe is there any change in that?,1,B2,12/19/2023
"I just wanted to add to that conversation. I think the total flow is going to be dependent on the outflow into the ocean. Similar to the way that our Stream Protection and Management Branch looks at total flow, we could probably get gage heights or something in that outflow ditch to assess how much water is actually flowing because if it doesn't flow into the outflow ditch I don't think that there's going to be a consumptive use of water from the mauka to the makai side except for maybe a little bit of evaporation. It's going to be a significant quantity once we determine if it flows into the ocean via the outflow ditch from the fishpond so that's an area that I think we'd look at gauging the quantity of flow, thanks.",1,B2,12/19/2023

CWRM Budget and Legislative Updates,0,C2,01/24/2023
"Chair, Commissioners, as well as community, we wanted to take this opportunity in the beginning of the Legislature to highlight where we’re at in the budget and some of the bills, at least the Administrative Bill that’s been introduced as of yesterday and some of the things that we may see or might not see coming out. I don’t think we’ve done this before with the Commission, but I think it’s timely and hopefully we can do this more often, keep you updated as our decision-making body. We’re known as LNR 404 in the DLNR budget, so you see that in budget worksheets, it’s very budget oriented, tons of spreadsheets in excel - that is our budget number. In general, here’s our base budget we’ve talked a lot about lack of resources or need for more resources and this is a quick summary from my very simplistic view as an administrator. We have 27 positions within the Water Commission, four of those were added in during my last tenure, prior to that we’ve been short. Since 1987 it’s been around this much between the teens and the twenties. These are 27 positions juxtaposed against the 1,084 positions of the overall DLNR budget. When you talk about balance and need for resources, 27 out of 1,084 for water is really telling and that is the picture I try to paint for most people. Twenty-two of those are general funded, 5 are special funded out of the state land development fund, those are revenues generated from leases developed by Land Division before the Board. Our FY 23 operating budget was a little over $4 million that includes almost $3 million in GF. We have a ceiling of $356,474 from our water resource management special fund and a ceiling of $812,768 from what we call our SPAM Special Fund. This funds 5 positions but also has about $110,000 that comes from the SLD fund for steam studies. It primarily pays for staff travel, the team that you see here doing our stream monitoring measuring, etc. as well as pay for some of our stream gages. The other general funds that are used, almost $2 million goes to staff personnel cost right now, about $1 million goes to the USGS gaging contract, so we have maybe less than half a million of discretionary funding for our general operations. That’s just the world we have to work within. We talk about resources, managing resources, so those are some of the challenges we work on.",0,C2,01/24/2023
Are all the positions funded positions?,0,C2,01/24/2023
"Great question. No, the four Aquatic Biologist positions in SPAM Branch that make up the 27, those four were created in 2019, taken away during the pandemic and just got put back in last session. We are working on establishing those. We have one vacancy in Groundwater Branch that we are trying to fill. On February 1, we’ll just have those four Aquatic Biologists positions and the 1 groundwater position that’s vacant, so we’ll have 22 filled positions.",0,C2,01/24/2023
Where do fines go?,0,C2,01/24/2023
"Fines will go into the Water Resource Management Fund, under 174C 5.5, that articulates what that fund can be used for. In general, I’ve advocated for $2 million annually in the CIP budget for deep monitoring well development. It costs about that much to do one deep monitoring well and we’ve been successful in upping that to a yearly request. Prior administrations or strategies have been to ask every supplemental year, so every other year, but in our USGS monitoring program, our proposed build out, it’s going to take 100 years if we just do one every two years. We really need to ramp this up and ask for more development funds if we want to get a better understanding especially of our groundwater resource and aquifers in the face of climate change. Next, I’m going to talk about what’s in the budget now. The four Aquatic Biologist positions were reestablished but whenever you reestablish start positions you only get half the year funding. This year we are asking for full year funding which is identified there for those four Aquatic Biologist positions. We are working with our HR office to determine whether that classification is appropriate or not and we may be shifting to some other classification like general professionals that gives us more flexibility to meet the needs of our staff and the work we need to do. The CIP appropriation for deep monitoring wells, those are the two funding budgets that were approved that made it into the Ige Administration budget. Legislation Senate Bill 1386 was just introduced yesterday but that was an administrative bill that we put in and this is relating to declaring water shortages and emergencies. Dealing with this Red Hill disaster and issue, one of the things, working with the Attorney General’s office, is that the bill declaring emergencies was tied to the shortage and shortage planning as articulated in the Code, so what we are recommending is to split it out to say that if there is an emergency that the Commission has the explicit authority to declare an emergency. There’s language and amendments to the Code to give the Commission that authority to deal with situations like this, hoping that we don’t ever have to use it and that we can anticipate shortage with better data and planning and proactive research, but if we didn’t use that, we’d have that tool available to us and that was in response to this Red Hill situation. Next is a graphic of DLNR’s overall CIP budget. The greenish color is the $2 million in CIP for deep monitoring well development. Last year we got a lump fund appropriation from the Legislature and as part of the kuleana of the Chair is to prioritize all the CIP projects throughout the agency. Fortunately, Water Commission has been able to stay on top of that table and get part of that lump sum of the portion of the $20,000,000. I just wanted to show graphically some of the things that are also being balanced within the overall agency. Lastly, the Green Administration had asked us for potential budget modifications or requested budget items. We added some but some of these were part of our original Ige Administration ask but weren’t in the Governor’s budget. We submitted a request to add seven new positions to Groundwater Branch and Survey Branch and that’s really to ramp up and meet the needs of some of our groundwater work and our water use permit approvals and reviews dealing with the Red Hill issue, etc. I framed this under a climate crisis research and monitoring but it’s important that we start to put monies towards this. We’ve asked for additional funding to add more stream gages to our system. USGS can only handle about five gages a year so we’re asking for five every year and the idea is just to keep asking for that every single year. It’s still not going to get us to build-out for another couple decades but we’re hoping that we can beef that up and partner with USGS and working with our Congressional Delegation to increase the federal resources in that program as well. Limu research we’ve been working with Water Resource Research Center, University of Hawai‘i, DAR and KUA to build off the year of limu and actually look at how groundwater dependent ecosystems and the research that they’ve done in Keauhou on limu. We can start to partner with them because that is the next thing we have to understand is how groundwater affects nearshore ecosystems and the nearshore environments as another public trust use of water and just to support our work with Water Resource Research Center funding to help with the management of the Hawai‘i Mesonet program through the Hawai‘i climate data portal. To shorten that timeframe of 100 years, if we develop a deep monitor well every year or every other year, we need to do more and we’re wanting to increase that $5 to $10 million but we’re also looking at federal funding resources to hopefully supplement or double down on our state budget that we do get allocated here. That’s generally our budget - omit the increase of $5 million a year that didn’t make it into the CIP. Sorry, that was a typo that didn’t get changed.",0,C2,01/24/2023
We are trying to be optimistic with Governor Green’s commitment to climate change. To utilize that we need to be prepared from the Water Commission side to address Commissioner Katayama’s question about being proactive. What can we do in light of climate change? I think we need to be situated to take advantage of federal funds as well as the Governor’s commitment to climate change. I do want to use our public Water Commission meeting also as a public forum as appropriate legislation arises to bring that to the Commission’s attention as well as the public’s attention so that we create a forum for public to provide us testimony or comments on proposed legislation.,0,C2,01/24/2023
"I know this is constrained with the practicality of the budget but two questions – one, where in your positions is there a point person to interface with DOH as we have joint responsibilities and two, are there positions that do not yet exist in divisions, that may not exist, that would be ideal to have, just so we keep in mind the ideal capacity of CWRM versus the current?",0,C2,01/24/2023
"We haven’t dreamt yet about what the ideal CWRM full build-out would look  like. You’re quickly reminded in government - that’s too big and too much. I hear what you’re saying and one of the things in the next four years I’m committed to, is helping to support staff to build their capacity and get more bodies in and part of that is growing smartly in a smart way. When you throw massive lumps of money and resources, the training, the onboarding, that change in culture is a shock. What I’ve been proposing with staff is these realistic requests for staffing and budget so we can grow smart and help to build that capacity over time. What you’re seeing, is talking with staff, where we believe we need to focus right now to meet current needs, but also will help to build capacity in the long term. That’s my short answer. With DOH, the groundwater team does interface regularly with DOH, especially on their safe drinking water side. Planning also takes a large role with coordinating with DOH. One of the things Kathy and I have talked about as Deputies in this next round, and thanks for confirming me, is to really tighten up our DOH and CWRM staff collaboration, our processing, and to really understand who is on first and in certain situations tighten up that relationship. Looking at funding opportunities, they have the revolving loan funds - whether those resources could be used and leveraged with CWRM’s limited resources to align projects or move together in certain ways. It’s a long-winded answer, but I think there’s enough momentum to better align the limited resource we do have with the leadership that’s in place. Kathy and I are continuing from the last administration so I think we can hit the ground running, unlike other departments that really have to build that momentum up. I’m hopeful, not putting Kathy on the spot, but I think we can do good things together and keep up the momentum that we’ve created.",0,C2,01/24/2023
"I appreciate the question, too. I think this administration as well as our own internal is really committed to better internal coordination. We need to be in sync - there’s really no reason because it all goes back to the public trust. When we aren’t in sync it leads to public mistrust. I think this administration is really emphasizing the need for greater coordination internally both within your own agency and externally with your sister agencies before we go out to the public. There’s a real desire to do that. Also, with respect to DLNR we have been living quite frankly over the last decade, hand to mouth, but there’s going to be a great infusion of both federal funds and this administration, as well as the Legislature’s commitment to climate change, for us to be in the lead of that. Like Kaleo said, we need to think big, and we need to start planning. We need to look at strategic planning, over the next 10, 20 years so all this emphasis on being more proactive, there is going to be a change of a mindset internally at DLNR. Many of our divisions are generating revenue that they have not done before so we are looking at more strategically at the future. We ask for your patience but there is a desire to be much more efficient and effective with our resources so that we can do better for the general public.",0,C2,01/24/2023
"Chair, getting to the full build-out, what resources and staff would be appropriate. The framework update to the Hawai‘i Water Plan, it is a tool and a mechanism, and putting that out there as a fellow planner, to really take that long-term perspective and build-out to that. I think once that framework update is completed and approved by this body, we are going to set the tone and vision for the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years. Then we’ll be able to figure out and determine what are the resources we need to accomplish those overall long-term plan goals. That framework is looking at climate change, place-based management and elevating traditional and ecological knowledge and practice of native Hawaiians, that holistic world view on water resource management. Once that framework is solid, and this body adopts it, then we can start to build-out that team to accomplish those large goals and visions.",0,C2,01/24/2023
"This is me switching to my UH hat. I just want to put it out here while DOH and CWRM are in the same room. The University and especially some departments are undergoing a big turnover and there’s going to be a lot of hires in the next several years because people have retired during the pandemic and there will be new openings. I think it would a great opportunity to make sure the UH is engaged - Water Resource Research Center is also rebuilding and to think about that. I’m also part of a scoping effort to think about what are the pathways we need to place people in water professions and it’s not just in engineering. To the extent possible, please don’t forget UH is part of your resource team.",0,C2,01/24/2023
"We’ve already engaged President Lassner about having more internships, having greater pathways, so that you get trained here within DLNR and when positions become available, there’s a nice smooth transition. There’s no reason why government should not be looking upon itself to provide a lot of these resources so we can keep our local kids here.

"Introduction to the U.S. Geological Survey Hydrologic Network in the Pacific Islands by Dr. Chris Curran, United States Geological Survey (USGS)",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Dr. Strauch of the CWRM Stream Protection and Management Branch introduced Dr. Chris Curran, with the USGS Pacific Islands Water Science Center, Assistant Center Director for Hydrologic Data. Dr. Curran gave a presentation on the USGS cooperative agreement and USGS activities related to water in Hawai‘i. He highlighted the hydrologic monitoring network and stream gaging operations including how data are collected, processed, reviewed for quality assurance, and delivered to the public.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Thank you very much Dr. Curran. Quick question, for FY 24 what is the number of gaging stations you are planning to install?",0,C1,08/15/2023
"For FY 24, that’s a fair question. We have two gages that we still have to install this year. And I can tell you we have, our FY 24 agreement includes 46 stream gages. We have 17 rain gages. We have 5 wells. In terms of installations, I don’t think we have...Ayron do you have that off the top of your head? I’m not sure. I know that we have been working with Ayron and Deputy Director Manuel to try to pass on some of the cost share and responsibilities to other agencies. I think we’ve been successful. This coming fiscal year we have the Kaua‘i Department of Water on board for some installations, so those are going to be new installations, but they were assisted with the help of communication from CWRM.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"So, the number of, go ahead Ayron. I’m sorry.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Let’s not get into item B-1 yet, but are you interested in the network that’s growing statewide that’s beyond just CWRM-funded?",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Absolutely. And I guess what I’m trying to understand, is the number of stations a function of how many other co-funding agencies there are, as opposed to something USGS undertakes on its own?",0,C1,08/15/2023
I can get into that.,0,C1,08/15/2023
Ok. Can I ask one more editorial comment from Chris? Recently there was a three-state agreement on how to share water in the Colorado River. Can you sort of provide an overview on what data was used to determine that?,0,C1,08/15/2023
For the Colorado River?,0,C1,08/15/2023
"Yes. There is an agreement I think California I believe, Arizona, and Nevada.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Yeah. That entire system has been contentious for decades. You know there was a lot of, it’s the result of many years of litigation. I have to say I’m not intimately familiar with it. I don’t want to over speak, but I can guarantee you that water data collected by the USGS was a foundational piece of that agreement because as a neutral party, rather than for example, the California State Water Authority managing things, USGS is a neutral party, it’s recognized as a neutral party. And so, we have a pretty extensive stream gaging network throughout California and up into Lake Meade area. And I know that data was and is being used heavily to monitor streamflow in the Colorado River. I’m sorry I can’t provide you with more information, I’m just not super familiar or I don’t have the latest information on that. But I could direct you to our California Water Science Center or we could get information from them if you had more questions.",0,C1,08/15/2023
I was looking more at the framework like a model going forward to resolve water issues. That’s a huge water issue.,0,C1,08/15/2023
"And you know I mean again USGS is just not a regulatory agency. So, our mission is to collect the science and collect the data and we don’t get involved in deciding how much water people get or even how it’s managed. We would provide technical advice on the data. And we would develop models for helping understand the natural system and we would share that information, but that’s the limit of what we can do and be engaged in.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Ok. Thank you, Chris.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Any other questions? Commissioners? Oh yes, Aurora.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Thank you, Chris Curran. I have a question. The USGS Water Science Center does a really good job at measuring stage and discharge. You mentioned briefly that water quality is also measured and I think that is becoming increasingly important with climate change considering changes to temperature that also give us insights into what is happening with or other geochemical tracers. So, what is the USGS doing to incorporate that kind of newer understanding, of understanding how flow and the other variables that might be of interest to managers? Or is there, this is not a co- op agreement, but you know what is the Water Science Center doing to think forward?",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Yeah. So, in the Pacific Islands Water Science Center, the water quality work is being done in our studies section so that was the green, back to that org chart, that was on the green side. For the most part, a lot of the water quality work that’s currently being done is looking at turbidity of streams, looking at doing sampling, doing discrete sampling for water quality parameters. I think that if you’re looking for concentrations, it’s important and trying to understand the flux, the movement of things like contaminants, it’s important to know how much water is in the channel. So, for the most part, our stream gaging network is sort of the foundation for a lot of water quality work, especially continuous water quality monitoring. The gaging stations can be outfitted with sensors that measure water quality parameters continuously. So that’s currently what we’re doing now here on O‘ahu and at several sites. And once that’s set up, then we have staff that go out and do sampling as opposed to measuring stream flow. Their role is strictly water quality sampling. I don’t know if I answered your question.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Yes, Chris thank you for your presentation. You began with a discernable sense of pride that we’ve been in partnership gathering this data at least back to 1917, so over 100 years. So, what is the value of having that historic record?",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Well, I think that we know that the climate is changing and the older record, first of all, the older record is really invaluable for helping us understand the baseline. How the baseline describes what the conditions were 100 years ago. From that baseline then we’re able to assess things like long-term change in flows or even water quality in some cases depending on the length of those data sets. So, we can always go out and collect more stream flow today, but we cannot go back in time and make measurements. So really the older information is very important. Especially in watersheds that maybe have less anthropomorphic effects, more natural conditions. Those older gages like Hālawa Stream, very important for understanding how quickly things are changing.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"So, I take it it makes sense if you could lengthen that longitudinal record you would. And I wonder if your data collection capabilities include accessing for instance, old sugar plantation records who were really good record keepers about water as well as in pre-contact times, the records of the observations of Hawaiian ancestors who were keen observers, analyzers, and recorders. But their method of recording data was just different. It was in chant and it was in story that had to be decoded. Does that capacity exist within your agency? Or have you considered partnering with local organizations to kind of help you extend that record?",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Yeah, that’s an interesting thought. I know that there are more models coming out that simply are using the question of whether there is or isn’t water in a stream. Especially the ephemeral streams and that kind of information certainly would probably exist during the timeframes you’re talking about, pre-European arrival and timeframe. I don’t know of any, and that’s not to say that it’s not being done. I don’t know, I’m just not familiar with any current projects that are being done to link those older and more recent data sets. It’s certainly a fascinating idea and I think it’s worthy of more exploration and discussion for sure.",0,C1,08/15/2023
I think Ayron Strauch is pretty aware of those sets and who’s kind of a local partner to partner with on that. We’ll leave that to you folks to consider.,0,C1,08/15/2023
"Chris can I follow up with Commissioner Hannah’s question? So based upon this baseline, can you summarize briefly some of the trends that you’re seeing over the 100-year period of time, the data that you’ve been collecting? Just high level.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"I’m not ready to do that on my own yet. Ayron is actually looking at the data much more than I’ve had a chance to. Full disclosure, I’ve been here two years and it was a big challenge just kind of learning where I’m at, learning what I know now. So, I’m continuing to learn, but actually trying to understand some of the trends. What streams are, where flow is decreasing over time. Ayron’s given talks and he’s got a better idea of this than I do.",0,C1,08/15/2023
Fair enough. We have our own in-house expert.,0,C1,08/15/2023
If I can add on that. There is a USGS report related to 2016 looking at trends and low flows.,0,C1,08/15/2023
"There were a couple fact sheets and Delwyn Oki did a report back in 2004, I think it was, and then Bassiouni and Oki published a report that looked at data from 1913- 2008. Chui Chang did a good assessment report for all water data in Pacific Island’s Water Science Center. I think that was 2016. So, we have reports that are published and available.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Very good, thank you. Other questions Commissioners? Oh, there’s Paul. Go ahead.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Thank you very much, Chris. Thank you for your presentation and for your work. They’re greatly appreciated. As you know it’s vital to anyone concerned with water in Hawai‘i. Really appreciate it. I’m glad you mentioned Ayron’s name. Ayron if I might, do you have any observations or comments based on the presentation this morning?",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Just that it is as previously mentioned, the length of record is really key. And thank you to the Commission who has supported re-establishment of some discontinued stations across the State. I believe at least 4 that I can name off the top of my head, have records for anywhere from 40-80 years before they were discontinued. And then in the last 5 years we’ve been able to reestablish them. So, getting that data collection back on track to be able to monitor those trends over time is really key. And just high level observations, low flows are declining. We’ve also seen in the last 6 years, a number of significant flood events. Very unusual to have that number across the State in a short time period. Take it as you will.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Thank you, gentlemen. Chris again, thank you very much. Your work really is vital to us. Appreciate you.",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Thank you Paul. Ayron, are you noticing dip trends on water quality based upon the different kind of uses? Agricultural uses from plantation days to something more diversified now?",0,C1,08/15/2023
"Unrelated to Commission work, prior to this position I held a research position at UH and one of the things I studied was impacts of land use change on water quality. And if you transition from forest conditions to more diversified agriculture, you get increased runoff and with that, sediment loads. And with that sediment loads, nutrients, and that sort of thing. Yes, with changing land cover, previous USGS scientists have also studied this, have also documented how in degraded environments, for example, you get heavier loads of different chemicals. So, I don’t think that’s anything groundbreaking.",0,C1,08/15/2023
Ok. Only reaffirms sort of anecdotally what was. Very good. Any other questions Commissioners?,0,C1,08/15/2023
"I just wanted to highlight the water alerts are very cool and I wasn’t aware of that. I think they will be a very good tool for people especially given USGS gold standards in terms of flood awareness. Usually, I’m just refreshing the website during a hurricane for instance. For folks who are getting flooded out that they can set the lows and highs. I’m glad this is recorded and public and people should shout it from the rooftops and make it work for them. I appreciate you highlighting that.",0,C1,08/15/2023

Why do you need to replace it and just not remove it?,1,B4,01/30/2024
I can call up Dr. Strauch to speak to the difficulties in having to cross that. Whenever there are high flows the basketball-sized boulders that are within the stream channel tend to get moved and when you’re trying to cross the stream at times it is...,1,B4,01/30/2024
Wasn’t that an old cane haul crossing historically?,1,B4,01/30/2024
"Yeah, it was in the submittal. I believe it was 70 or 90 years old.",1,B4,01/30/2024
"So again, is there a need to access at that point?",1,B4,01/30/2024
"Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Branch. I won’t speak on behalf of DOFAW, but I do know that state employees, both DOFAW and CWRM if not other state employees utilize the lands mauka of this crossing. This is an important access point to forest reserve and game management area lands. CWRM has two monitoring stations above this crossing. The original crossing was passable under most non-flooding conditions, but currently it takes a lot of maintenance, to maintain any sort of crossing some sort of excavator has to move around the boulders after high flow events.",1,B4,01/30/2024
Well aware of that.,1,B4,01/30/2024
Not just state employees but the public likes to access the forest and the streams mauka of this location.,1,B4,01/30/2024
There is a utility value?,1,B4,01/30/2024
"Maybe Sheri can speak to that as well, from DOFAW.",1,B4,01/30/2024
If you could share with us what the crossing is used for and by whom?,1,B4,01/30/2024
"Sure, aloha Chair, Commission. My name is Sheri Mann, I’m the branch manager for the Division of Forestry and Wildlife for Kauaʻi island. This forest reserve has many uses by the public, it’s also the primary access road to Blue Hole which is towards the end of the road and a very unique geologic formation on Kauaʻi island. It’s also the location where the North and South Fork streams start and divert and so there’s a lot of uses of those streams. As Ayron said there are some devices up there to be checking instream flows. It’s also a major hunting area and we have people up there every day of the week hunting and it’s used a lot by cultural practitioners. It’s heavily used in terms of forest reserves on Kauaʻi island. It’s also the primary route to get up to do research and all kinds of management activities that are critical for us to maintain, so we slowed down the encroachment of invasive landscape-altering plants that we don’t want to go up into the upper mauka watershed that’s highly protected.",1,B4,01/30/2024
"Sheri, it’s a vehicular access, right?",1,B4,01/30/2024
"Yes, the Queensland Crossing is actually a cement ford and over time the ford has been deteriorated and then the floods of 2018, it was pretty much wiped out. We’ve done our best to try and patch it and fix it over time, but it’s just been altered significantly at which time we approached Rep. Tokioka for a CIP for more of a long-term repair. These are the funds that are going into that kind of work and this permit is needed to put that work into action. It’s a $2 million CIP.",1,B4,01/30/2024
The permittee is DOFAW?,1,B4,01/30/2024
I’m not sure if it’s under engineering or under us.,1,B4,01/30/2024
"Well, it’s actually DLNR, it’s not the county.",1,B4,01/30/2024
So DLNR. There’s always an issue about who should be maintaining streams and whether that’s the state or the county. I guess we won’t address that here.,1,B4,01/30/2024
"State lands, in this case it’s the state.",1,B4,01/30/2024
"This is for staff and it pertains to traditional and customary practices. While the applicant kind of reviewed the site history, are there downstream users who could potentially be affected by the construction and repair of this? Specifically, when we discussed Mahi Pono’s modifications we talked about downstream users and just notification of when construction is happening. If there are downstream users that may notice changes in flow or quality, that we consider that in this application?",1,B4,01/30/2024
"At this point in the stream if you’re speaking specifically to aquatic species I believe there is a lot of largemouth bass in this section of the stream so our concern for native species isn’t as, not to says it’s not of concern in this area, but we temper that there is a considerable amount of invasive species such as bass and trout in this section the stream.",1,B4,01/30/2024
The quantity of water won’t change in the stream and obviously best management practices regarding water quality will be practiced.,1,B4,01/30/2024
"Specifically speaking to traditional and customary practices, are there any kalo farmers down gradient? I don’t know this area well so that wasn’t...",1,B4,01/30/2024
There shouldn’t be any impacts to the flows in the stream while construction is going on.,1,B4,01/30/2024
"Even during construction, you won’t have to stop the flows to put in this?",1,B4,01/30/2024
They’re just building a small coffer dam for half the stream at a time.,1,B4,01/30/2024
"We will be closing the Loop Road during construction so that won’t allow the public to traverse to this point or beyond it. There are other ways to get beyond this point but they’re from either other landowners or they would have to go through forest non-accessible lands. There will be a temporary change to general access for all users, but it’ll just be during the construction phase of the project and it’s basically repairing the ford that was already there so the water flows over it. The way we’ve been mitigating it is building the rocks back up so users can cross but this should allow smooth, traversable access with a four-wheel drive. Ayron would know better but I don’t see this changing the water flow. That really has been a natural occurrence when floods come, it comes raging down but otherwise it’s fairly consistent.",1,B4,01/30/2024
"Following up on Aurora’s comment about hunters, are we notifying hunters that this access may be closed temporarily so that they’ll have to find alternate access?",1,B4,01/30/2024
"Yes, we have had to close it several times over the last several years due to the impassibility of it. They’re fairly aware and used to us closing but certainly once we get close to construction time, we’ll put out press releases and consult with the GMAC and make sure that all the stakeholders are aware of this. I think they’re supportive of it because right now they either can’t pass, or they take a chance passing which is not anything we want. We’ve had vehicles get stuck and roll into the river and we just want to avoid that. They are aware and we will certainly reiterate that.",1,B4,01/30/2024
It’s probably better that we improve it for water quality and everything else. They’re probably driving all over the place.,1,B4,01/30/2024

"Okay Ms. Ho‘opi‘i, I'm not too sure if you've heard the previous conversation, the discussion. But did you want to add anything?",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Aloha Chair Chang and Commissioners. Well, I first want to express, thank you to Rebecca for all the help that she has given. My family has come from Wai‘ehu since before the time of the Mahele. I have also submitted in my application a verification from OHA stating that they verified the genealogical tie to the original awardee or the property, the kuleana property. And we've been growing taro on that land for generations. The water did initially come direct from north Wai‘ehu Stream and was severed because of vandalism and other things that took place. If you're asking, can you please remind me what you're needing me to comment on related to Wes and Jodie's?",1,B3,08/15/2023
"No, well this one is more on yours. We're deciding to take the two matters together since they seem to have similar issues raised by both you know Mr. Chumbley as well as Mr. Geiger regarding the potential impacts to the PUC compliance and then second it was you know, providing, we were looking at providing a deferral until that legal question can be addressed. The consultation with PUC to ensure there's no adverse impact.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"So, I think that's the issue is, okay, well, one, we're contemplating a deferral for 30 days to permit staff to meet with PUC to coordinate under the MOU. And are you comfortable or have any objections to that?",1,B3,08/15/2023
"I find that just a little bit hard to answer simply because I'm not aware of what the MOU is or the PUC requirements are. We have been waiting a while for the water and so I was hoping that it could be approved pending the PUC follow-up, but I guess I would have to defer to the Commission to make that decision.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"You know I appreciate that. I'm sorry, if you have access to our website Wailuku Water Company’s testimony, I believe, was submitted and you can see what their concerns are. They're not necessarily saying that they have an objection to the use or the water but it's the process. That there is this, they have a PUC order, we have this MOU with, you know, the Water Commission. Wailuku Water Company and PUC and we may need to coordinate with PUC to ensure that we’re not putting Wailuku Water Company in jeopardy so that we can move forward.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Understood, which is why I'm saying I’ll leave it to the Commission. I don't have one way or the other because the approval and all the forwarding approvals need to come from the Commission. So, if that’s what needs to be done, yeah.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"I greatly appreciate this because I think Mr. Chumbley said if we do proceed forward, it is likely that they will request a contested case hearing. Okay Mrs. Ho‘opi‘i, Mr. Mundy’s hand is up, but I'm going to provide you an opportunity. Do you have anything else you want to add?",1,B3,08/15/2023
"I don’t think at this time, thank you. Chair Chang: Okay, thank you. Mr. Mundy, your hand is up.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Thank you, Chair. I wanted to and if I’m wrong please correct me, Michelle, but as I understand it the water distribution to that property was actually previously, has already been approved. And they’re just requesting that it be restored. So, if it was already approved would that even make it an issue for the PUC Commission? Because again it’s not adding to the draw, it’s using, it’s restoring an already approved draw that has been in place for I believe before Michele's, passed generationally to her and her portion of the family. And again if I’m wrong please correct me, Michele, but that would seem to make it not a PUC issue and maybe not even in line with our application.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Actually, okay so I was, my family was not part of the Na Wai ‘Eha case because we already had water coming to the property. Both where I'm asking and both on the other side of Malaihi Road. The problem is that the ditch was severed, cutting off our water to the property. So, I’m a new user not even related to anything that the Na Wai ‘Eha case was related to.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Thank you, thank you.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Commissioners, do you have any questions? Larry?",1,B3,08/15/2023
"I guess a couple. If it’s a new use then we still, still falls under the concerns that I previously expressed. The second part is that looking at Ho‘opi‘i’s application, it would have from my standpoint, met what I quote-unquote call the old standard of what T&C is. But what I'm concerned is that whether the analysis was done assuming that the new standard on the D&O was used and I’m worried that if that is so, if the Supreme Court looks at this issue and raises it and changes it, whether it would affect our approval of their permit. So that even though I look at it and say, “looks to me like it’s a slam dunk case, they have both appurtenant rights and T&C rights,” but if the Commission made its decision under what is the new standard of T&C I’m just worried about the legality of it.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"I wanted to add, the water used to come through from north Wai‘ehu Ditch through Maniania Ditch and the plantation at that time, there was a diversion to have the water redirected up towards how white pipe is running. So, from the sugar plantation to Wailuku Ag to Wailuku Water Company, that's the course of where the water was flowing. So those are the entities that had to redirect our water to the property. So, Wailuku Water Company is just a lead from the past previous entity owners so we technically was still getting water through Wailuku Water Company, Wailuku Sugar. So, it's not like we're a brand new user. We've been having water to the property from way back Mahele time. And just to give more clarification the property is in conveyance to me from that LCA awardee to my tutu, to my tutu, to my tutu, my mom and then me and my other siblings. So, what I'm saying is that we've had existing water to the property since before the time of the Mahele. It's only because it's been severed at the point of white pipe that we now do not have water. We've had continuous water up until 2014.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"You’re entitled to water based upon your relationship to this land and as you have historically, your family has exercised traditional and customary practices so the fact that the water isn't running and you're trying to restore that. But you have an independent right as a traditional and customary practice.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Yes, but I'm wanting to make clear that I'm not technically a new user.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Right, right. I appreciate the point of clarification. I think that and you know quite frankly if you can assert a traditional and customary practice, that is a pre- existing right that runs with the land. But I am curious to see the intersect between PUC, the Water Commission under this MOU because I'm having a hard time seeing how the PUC can trump our jurisdiction, but it may just be a matter of coordination and it may just be a matter of consultation. I am concerned that if we proceed forward, we've got an indication that there will be a contested case hearing which will put us into a much more protracted process versus giving us 30 days to see if we can do the PUC consultation to confirm that we have the right to proceed forward on these permits.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Yeah, can I just add for clarification? In the conversations with PUC in the development of the MOU, they made it very clear that they're not the experts on water rights and that they defer all of those decision making to this body. And that a lot of times in sequencing, which is also tied to kind of a decision in Nā Wai ‘Ehā , they basically put a hold on the CPCN until the decision was made by this body in order to determine whether appurtenant rights or other water rights still existed or granted. And then they would act on the application or the docket before them. It's just a sequencing issue more so than I think a jurisdictional issue has been framed, but again we are supportive of kind of clarifying that and getting and maybe even having the PUC present or staff here to answer any questions this body may have in a future decision making on these two items.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Yeah, I appreciate it. If Mr. Chumbley and Mr. Geiger weren't on the call asserting that they may file a contested case hearing, I'd be real comfortable with just going with that. But I mean I think moving cautiously I mean that's kind of what I'm thinking. Mr. Geiger your hand is up?",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Yes, Chair. Thank you very much. I know we're not entitled and have no right to do this, but again in the spirit of cooperation to the extent that if the Commission decides to defer for consultation I think it would be helpful if a representative of Wailuku Water Company could be in the room so that we could have our questions answered and feel comfortable with whatever coordination is adopted by the Commissions.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"If I can. Mahalo, Jim for the request. You can make the requests; I will say that because you are a party before the PUC oftentimes in our conversations directly with the PUC they cannot have conversation with you as a regulator. So that's where the MOU came into play and where we were trying to agency to agency look at policy and jurisdictional issues. So, I will make the request, but having you as a party with a docket that's open, they're really reluctant having this ex-parte communications with you or with somebody in the room. So totally understand the operational issues. Let us take the first step and then hopefully we'll have findings from those conversations and then if it's possible to bring you in and other parties that may have standing in that conversation, we’ll do so.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Appreciate that, thank you.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Avery, your hand is up. Oh, you're muted.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"It keeps muting itself. I guess you don't want to hear me. Thank you, Chair. Deputy, I would note that it's not ex-parte communication if the PUC attorneys are present and our PUC attorney would be present. Then as long as both of those are there then it would be appropriate. Mr. Geiger is not our PUC attorney. Doug Codiga in Honolulu at Schlack Ito is the PUC attorney so without having us involved in the discussion to be able to raise the issues, I think we would be missing a lot of the critical points that need to be deliberated on. Thank you.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Nope, you raise a good point, but what we'll do Avery, we'll make the request and it'll be up to them. They may want to have separate meetings, I don't know, but I think...",1,B3,08/15/2023
"You may want your Deputy Attorney General, Julie, there too.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Okay, so with that being said, do I have any other questions? We're having a real nice free-flowing conversation, so any Commissioners do you have any further questions, comments? Do I have a motion? Hōkūao, I'm gonna let you one more time before we make a motion. Go ahead.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Sorry, I didn't have a chance to speak.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Oh, I'm sorry. You're right, my apologies to you.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Mahalo, Chair. I just again wanted to go on record that Hui o Nā Wai ʻEhā is in support of Ho‘opi‘i ‘‘ohana’s request for a water use permit and any assistance that they need, additional assistance that they may need we're waiting to support. I also did want to note that I did but I didn't specify in my testimony prior to this which I was going to repeat on this particular docket was just one particular concern. Again, this is probably kind of moot at this point because it looks like both items will be deferred but I did again want this to be on the record that just one of the concerns that we had not necessarily with the applicant but pertaining to the source. And it's been our understanding, our organization’s understanding that over the last two to three years water use permitting specifically in Waihe‘e and Wai‘ehu have not been receiving adequate flow amounts from both sources which includes the Waihe‘e and Spreckels Ditch based on the total amount allocated to users. I believe CWRM staff is well aware of some of these challenges especially specifically to the south Waihe‘e kuleana ‘auwai via the Spreckels Ditch. Again, that's not necessarily pertinent to this however, there are some similar challenges based off the Waihe‘e Ditch system. So, we just ask that the Commission staff continue to support, you know, and having staff maybe come out continue to measure some of these sources not only for the different kuleana ditch and ‘auwai intakes, but also from the main source for which these traditional systems connect to. You know we can be giving water away all day or at least approving water, but if it isn’t available then really these don’t mean anything right? So, I just wanted to put that on record on behalf of Hui o Nā Wai ʻEhā, again that we support the Ho‘opi‘i ‘ohana and the Mundys and that there are some source challenges as well. And hopefully that we can get that rectified at some point, mahalo.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Thank you very much for that, Hōkūao. With that being said, Aurora did you want to make a formal motion to defer?",1,B3,08/15/2023
I had a question first that earlier there was some discussion about going into executive session. Do we need to?,1,B3,08/15/2023
"I think with your decision to defer, you've covered pretty much everything. Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani: Is 30-days sufficient, Kaleo?",1,B3,08/15/2023
"We'll work with staff to try to expedite this and bring it back as expeditiously as possible. Because it involves another agency we’re also on their time schedule as well, but we’ll relay the urgency to try to bring it back in time for September.",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Do we need to set a date, a time or can we say until such time as, you know, this meeting has occurred?",1,B3,08/15/2023
"Yeah, I mean I don't mind keeping the pressure on especially for the families who have been waiting. So, this puts us, the onus is on now on us to move this matter along and if you need additional time you can come back to us and ask for a deferral, but we will try to have. And you know those of you on Maui you just really can appreciate how that you know Maui's becoming a priority for so many other things. So, we're going to, staff is going to try their best to meet this deadline within 30 days coming back and bringing this matter after consulting with PUC. Okay?",1,B3,08/15/2023
MOTION: (KAGAWA-VIVIANI / HANNAHS) To defer items B-2 and B-3 for 30 days to permit Commission staff to coordinate with Public Utilities Commission staff and address questions raised. UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED (MIIKE/KATAYAMA/HANNAHS/CHANG/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/MEYER),1,B3,08/15/2023
"The next item on the agenda is Item B-1, it is the adoption of the Maui Water Development Plan, and if you can put the testifiers into the Zoom room and we'll call you when we're ready to take public testimony. Thank you, Katie.",1,B1,06/20/2023
So we'll take a staff presentation. Thank you.,1,B1,06/20/2023
"Commissioners. Katie Roth, Planning Branch of the commission. Item B-1 is the adoption of the Maui Island Water Use Development Plan for incorporation in the Hawaiʻi Water Plan. You may remember a few months ago, back in March, staff gave an overview of the (inaudible) submittal and the plan itself, so in the interest of time, I'm not going to go into the details that were presented then. That is available; that recording is available on the website.  Those that  that presentation included an overview of some of the major themes and concerns that were raised during public testimony as well as staff's recommendations and responses to those concerns. The submittal you have before you includes the same items. That begins on page 7, and then the staff recommendation on page 11 includes the underlying items that you'll see. I wanted to highlight that after the March 21st presentation, there was additional outreach done by staff with DWS, Maui County, and members of the Haiku community. That was in response to certain items and themes that were identified. We really wanted to make sure that we addressed them sufficiently so that we could come to you today with recommendations and an item that you felt comfortable approving, knowing that we had done our due diligence and additional outreach. So some of the recommendations you see have been tweaked slightly based on those conversations with certain stakeholders and the county. I guess at this time, I would just say that staff believes that the plan itself meets all the statutory requirements set forth in the State Water Code, and it sufficiently addresses the recommended elements in the Hawai‘i Water Plan framework pertaining to updates of the County Water Use and Development Plan. So we feel that the plan you see today is sufficient and meets every  all of the requirements needed to be approved.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"I will reiterate the recommendation, so we have that on record. Staff recommends that the commission adopt the Maui Water Use and Development Plan for incorporation into the Hawai‘i Water Plan. Commission staff will also commit to work with the County of Maui on the following 1. Maui DWS will hire a consultant to write a Maui Island Water Use and Development Plan summary document of the plan for public consumption. The summary document should clearly articulate what charts, figures, tables, and data have been amended and, when relevant, provide links to the updated data source. 2. Commission and Maui DWS will incorporate the findings of the USGS Study on Climate Change Impacts on Groundwater Recharge into water planning documents, including the Maui Island Water Use and Development Plan and updated sustainable yields. 3. Maui DWS will organize meetings annually with the Kahikinui, Hana, Koolau, Central, Lahaina, and Wailuku Aquifer Sectors stakeholder groups to better quantify the water needs of residents, including traditional kuleana users, rural residents, and small farmers. Feedback and data from these meetings will be incorporated into a future update of the Maui Island Water Use and Development Plan. Maui DWS will report back  4. Maui DWS will report back to the commission within one year with an update on the status of the USGS hydrological study of the Haiku Aquifer. And 5. Commission staff will continue to work with Maui DWS to support development of their water conservation programs, including water loss control components that implement the findings of completed annual water audits.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"I'd also like to mention that we have Council Member Shane Sinenci on the line along with Eva Blumenstein for DWS, and I believe Director Stufflebean is also in attendance virtually if you have additional questions.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"And with that, I will be available for any questions you have.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Commissioners, do you have any questions for staff?",1,B1,06/20/2023
Maybe a quick recommendation on your Recommendation 3 is all-encompassing; you might want to at least recognize this soon-to-be-formed East Maui Water Authority or something just to  just to make sure that we're aware of what's going on 'cause that probably includes three or four of these annual meetings.,1,B1,06/20/2023
"Yes, absolutely. And that was something that was discussed during public testimony and in conversations with the County.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"I have a question on Recommendation 5, which focused on working with Maui DWS to support development of [fair] their water conservation programs. And given Maui DWS is, like, one of several providers, you know, how  is there a  when you say their water conservation programs, that is limited to Maui DWS. [This may be] Is there [broadened] broader [to] support for island-wide conservation.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Yes, absolutely. So the water audits themselves include more than just the DWS systems, but I think that's some good feedback. (Inaudible) is only referring to Maui DWS. So if that's something you want to amend",1,B1,06/20/2023
we can definitely do that.,1,B1,06/20/2023
"I will say that the  the water audits, especially in the Lahaina area, are being used as part of our assessment of the water use permit applications that we've been receiving",1,B1,06/20/2023
"(Inaudible), so we're trying to understand where efficiencies can be made not just in the public, but in the private systems as well.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Yes. Katie, the submittal is really clear that this fulfills a statutory obligation that we have to have a plan. How does this strengthen our water management? These will be the County of Maui.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"That's a good question. So these plans themselves, obviously, as you know, are often imperfect. It takes many years to write them, so they're never going to be perfect (inaudible). That's why we try to approach them as living documents where they can be refined and updated as needed. I'd probably refer to  to the county and their implementation plan for specifics on how this will be used to move Maui County forward in terms of their water development and water resource protection initiatives, but that's also part of the exhibits that needs to be  that needs to (inaudible). I think one of the important points to keep in mind is that this plan was developed in accordance with the old Hawaiʻi Water Plan framework from 2000, and we are in the process of updating that framework. And so we hope to consider a lot of other issues, cultural issues that aren't specifically maybe brought out or explicit in the existing plans that you see coming before you, but it's something thatto incorporate into future updates as it's a huge component that is often missing from these plans.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Thank you. And I'll wait to hear more from Maui, Maui officials. Thank you.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Okay. Oh, go ahead, Joanna.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"For Item 1, is there a due date for that summary?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"So it's in process now, but I can let Eva comment more specifically on where they're at, but I believe it's in process, and they should have it done in six to nine months.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"My question  my only question is, what is the impact if we don't approve this plan?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"That's a good question. Well, it's already being used by the county for a lot of their capital improvement projects and planning efforts. So if we do not approve it, I believe they're still going to use it in some way to guide their process and what  and what they hope to achieve with water resource protection on the island. Again, defer it probably to the county to provide more specific information about how not approving at this time would impact the outcome. I know that they've worked very hard many years",1,B1,06/20/2023
"to get to this point. I know that it's been a long process, and not all the parties have been satisfied. Unfortunately, I think that's just how it goes sometimes when you do outreach over many, many years. But yeah, I think the county might be able to comment a bit more about what impacts specifically not adopting the plan would have.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Okay, awesome. If there are no other questions, I'm going to invite the county to provide us comments.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Council Member Shane Sinenci, would you like to speak first?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Okay. Aloha kākou and aloha, Chair Chang.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"I'm happy to be  aloha nō. I'm happy to be here in support of the commission's recommendations. We are supportive of the commission creating a summary of the report, and also we support having regular updates made to the plan, including the Board of Water Supply and the council's input. This will be important for community outreach and  and just general awareness. We've heard loud and clear from the community that they want to see up-to-date information data within the plan, and I'm supportive of having the Department of Water Supply update those numbers over time. So again, we just wanted to express our mahalo for your consideration of this plan. As Katie said, it has been a monumental task over the last couple of years, and many stakeholders were involved in the process, and so  and again, mahalo for coming to our communities and hearing their concerns. Thank you.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Council Member.   Commissioners, do you have any questions for Shane?  Shane, I just had a clarification. In what you  your comments this morning was that the commission will provide a summary. Is that  that's the Maui  it's not  you're not looking at the  Water Commission staff to do the summary, right?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, we're  correct. We're just supportive of the commission's recommendations.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Okay, okay, okay. Very good, very good. Thank you.  No other questions?  (No response.)",1,B1,06/20/2023
"I have Director John Stufflebean, Maui County Department of Water Supply.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Nice to meet you all virtually. Again, John Stufflebean. I've been the director since January, so I'm  I'm new here. And I understand that there were many concerns and opposing testimonies in adopting the plan, and I believe that the commission deputy and his staff have worked diligently with  with both the Department of Water Supply county staff and community members to address these concerns. So, you know, I've read through the plan, and I found that it reflects many of  kind of the department goals and is guiding us in the right direction. And it  it spells out strategies that both diversify our water supply, work towards solutions and work closer with other water purveyors  there are several other water purveyors on Maui  and with other county agencies to consider all the resources. And I want to just kind of briefly go through a few of the things that we're working on now that  that kind of came out of the plan that are, you know, basically implementing the plan. As was said earlier, even though it hasn't been adopted, we're using it. You know, it's  it's a very valuable plan in that it just  it utilized so much input from the community and other sources, so  So, first of all, in terms of watershed protection, we are  we are  for years, we've been doing grant funding to  to fund non-profits to do watershed protection. We're looking at increasing that in the future. Maybe that's  that might even be the most important thing that we're doing to protect the source, so that will continue. We're also protecting our water from contamination. We have a bill that's just been introduced to county council to establish wellhead protection in overlay districts so that there's less risk of well contamination, you know, in the area of the wellheads. We've got a lot going on in water conservation. We  we're retrofitting all of our meters with Smart Meters. Smart Meters allow the meters to be read remotely, which has a couple of advantages. One is the meter reader doesn't have to physically go to the meter, but the other advantage is it provides real-time information on water use. And back in my  I came from California. My career back there, we did a study in one of the cities I was in, and the Smart Meters decreased water use 15 percent  we did a pilot study  because people can get real information on how much water they're using and it also detects leaks. So if  like, if the meter is running 24 hours non-stop, you get a note, hey, you may have a leak, so it really helps with water conservation. We're also  have landscape incentives and guidelines as well as requirements. And we're working out a water conservation bill to introduce to the  to the county council and our water board that will  it will beef up our water conservation requirements.And a big one is our tiered structure. As the other islands do, we have a tiered structure, and council has just approved a revision to our tier structure where we increase the upper tier a lot. And so basically, you know, the  the lifeline water rate didn't change much, but the top tier, we increased 24 percent. So that's  that was found to be maybe one of the most important things you can do. You know, money talks, right? So to  you know, to  to encourage people to  to reduce water use, especially those that are using a lot. We also implemented  council will be  has approved a new rate for hotels and resorts that's a higher rate so that they pay more for the water. And we do have some gray water initiatives going as well. We've got one going in one of our parks and getting ready to put in another one. So we see those as templates to help, you know, increase gray water use throughout the county. We also have some strategies that deal with climate change. We're supporting the collaborative hydrological efforts studies of impacts of climate change and future well development on groundwater health. And we have an ongoing study with USGS to  to assess the effects of scenario-based recharge change on groundwater in the Maui aquifers as demand. increases. And we're adding stream gauges and monitoring wells and other tools to assess what's happening with climate change. In terms of source, we are  for our central system  you probably know Maui has 12 separate water systems, which is so interesting 'cause I'm fairly new here. On our central system, we're exploring new basal well development in the southern portion of the Waihee Aquifer and East  East Maui well development as well. And we're currently conducting a feasibility study to be followed by USGS assessment on the interaction between the groundwater and surface water and potential impacts from pumping the Haiku Aquifer. For Upcountry, we're exploring new well development in the Makawao Aquifer and the Haiku to meet demand on the Upcountry meter priority list. And we're assessing the new raw water reservoirs to increase reliable supply with consideration adopted to other in-stream flow standards. And we're also considering alternative structures and processes to expedite the issuing of meters. And that's a whole 'nother meeting. I won't get into the meter list, but we're looking at about four or five different strategies to help us  to help us address that meter list in a more efficient way. And on the west side over at Lahaina-Kapalua area, Kaanapali, we're pursuing new wells and also working with Maui Land and Pine and Hawai‘i Water Services to integrate  you know, to look at how we can integrate our systems better to most efficiently utilize the water in the area. And then, finally, to address drought and system resiliency, we're formalizing demand response plans and mutual agreements with the private water purveyors to address water shortages. It was said earlier when  we can declare a water shortage, but it's really helpful if all the other water companies on the island also declare a water shortage. So we're looking  you know, we see that as a really important element. We're developing wells to improve reliability as a  as a contingency in areas that are dependent on surface water. The wells are  you know, tend not to respond as quickly to  obviously, rainfall events. And then we're looking to  you know, three of  three of our main water supplies in three of our main areas are the ditch systems, and so we'll continue relying on those, so we're exploring how we invest in those systems to make sure that they're  they're adequately maintained. And we're assessing the Wailuku Water Company system and potentially other legacy systems as well. So, in summary, the plan serves us as a long-term guide; that's the value of it. It provides us a framework in which to  to plan our efforts, and I believe it's a good foundation that we can update. Obviously, that's mentioned. many times. We need to update this regularly and  and we'll work with the community and commission staff to do that in each sector. And we're also  just as a reminder we're tackling the Molokai Water Use and Development Plan, and we also have funding for the Lanai Plan coming up in this fiscal year. So mahalo for your attention. Thank you.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Thank you very much, Director.  Any questions?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Yes, Director. So congratulations on your  your new post. We welcome you to this role of public service, and we thank you for your testimony. We're particularly grateful that the county is taking upon itself to kind of invest in watershed protection and in those transmission systems, those ancient transmission systems which are really  really undermining the prudent use of a very valuable resource. My question is, you've got different bodies there. You've got the administration's water management team, you've got boards, and then you've got a new board for  coming, that's coming up on the scene. Will the plan help in put  giving them one page to work off of and kind of get everybody on the same page? And you might have a different role in that, but we're all working for the same set of objectives. Is this  is this plan kind of a navigational star in that",1,B1,06/20/2023
"That's an excellent point.  Yeah, there are many players involved in the water world, and, you know, really, partnerships are essential to making progress in water and, again, to making sure that everyone's kind of heading true north together. And so, yes, absolutely, this plan  this plan will help guide all of us to make sure we're all headed the same direction and  and making progress towards a better future. That's a really good point. Thank you.",1,B1,06/20/2023
That's it. Thank you.,1,B1,06/20/2023
Any other questions? Mike.,1,B1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, a comment. Again, congratulations on your new post, and I echo Commissioner Hannahs's comments. Maui County was the first county that established a watershed partnership and the first county that (inaudible), so I  I definitely encourage that. Just really curious. Briefly, you came from California; you guys don't lack for water issues. What's it like coming to Hawai‘i? Are there things that you brought that can help, or are we out in front, or are we way behind?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"I wouldn't say you're in front or behind. It's different, for sure. I mean, there are  there are certainly some  you know, many of the kind of skills and knowledge I developed in California that are veryhelpful here. They're very  a lot of similarities. But for sure, there are unique situations on the islands and on Maui, especially, which I'm having a fascinating time learning because, you know, I  well, I've never seen that one before. I've  you know, I've certainly had many of those moments, you know. So I  you know, I bring in, you know, 40-plus years of water experience in California and Arizona. And actually, in Missouri as well, but that isn't quite as relevant because they have lots of water there. But, you know, certainly it helps and, you know, and there's certain basic principles that  that I bring with me. For example, the value of partnerships which we just talked about. In California, there's 400 water and wastewater agencies, you know, that have to work together and, you know, not to mention the state and the federal and cities and counties and so on. And then also kind of the  the need to have  and I'll just say one more thing, the need to have what we call a diversified water portfolio where, you know, you need to have multiple sources of water and be  have a resilient redundant system. And so we're working on that both in terms of the sources and then also in terms of the  the transmission and delivery systems to make sure they're, you know, robust and redundant and can handle the  you know, the things that always happen to disrupt the system.",1,B1,06/20/2023
All right. So thanks very much.,1,B1,06/20/2023
"Any other questions? I  I have one. John, this plan  undoubtedly, there were challenges with communities, so  but it seems like, you know, Council Member Sinenci did a lot of good work in reaching out, as did the rest of the commission. How are you proposing to engage  continue to engage the community in this ongoing dialogue on water?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Well, sure, I mean, very actively and  you know, and, you know, Eva  Eva leads that effort, and I think a lot of good work has been done and  and Shane has been also great in this, from my understanding. You know, I believe there's a  certainly the  we need to engage with the community in many ways, robustly, often, and listen to the community. You know, we can't always do exactly what the community wants, you know, sometimes you have to say, Well, that's not exactly what we can do, but  but absolutely, we need to listen. And so, you know, it's  I go out in the community, I've been to hundreds and hundreds of community meetings in my career. And, you know, we had just one  we had a couple up in recently Upcountry, and it was extreme. It was 300 people at the Kula Community Center. And, you know, listening to their concerns, they bring a lot of valuable information which we need to hear, and we need to understand it, and we need to consider that as we make our decisions. So I'm a strong advocate of community participation and will continue to do that, very actively be involved with that. And then, you know, Eva will help me with how that's done here in Hawai‘i, which is  there's a lot to it here, for sure.",1,B1,06/20/2023
I'm encouraged by your comments. Thank you very much. Any other comments?,1,B1,06/20/2023
"Chair, may I ask?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Thank you, Chair. Hi, John. Thank you for the presentation. The action list that you just described, how and when would that be embedded in the water use plan that's before us today?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"I think it's in there. I mean, almost everything  I believe everything I said has a direct link to the plan. So I didn't  I didn't quote the sections, but, you know, essentially everything that we're doing has a link back to the plan.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"So, is there a quantitative measure of what your targets are for reuse and reduction that's part of the plan and as it's tied into your general development plan for Maui as well as community development plans? Because at some point, you know, these uses will come before us for us to approve, and I guess it'd be helpful if we had some assurances that  that the allocations are based on lans that you've just described.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Right, yeah, that is the case. I'll probably  I think I will defer to Eva for that in terms of the  the quantitative connection to the plan because she's much more familiar with it than I am, having worked on it for  for many years. So, Eva, I'll let you  let you tackle that one if you don't mind.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Go ahead. Eva, go ahead.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Mahalo, Chair. Yeah, in response to the commissioner's question, yes, there are quantified targets for each strategy, in fact, that relates to resource use. So in terms of recycled water, you  you have the demand and supply projected through year 2035, so in terms of targeting buildout of R1 or other recycled water use, or whether it's groundwater development or conservation targets, you have those quantified, you know, in five-year increments. And then the strategies kind of have the short- to long-term implementation range. Some of these projects will be, you know, further scoped out over a very long time, and some of them, like the director mentioned, are already in the works. So, yeah, so there are targets in there that we are working through tracking in the implementation matrix so we can report progress to our board and council and to you folks.",1,B1,06/20/2023
And I'll only add to that (Laughter.),1,B1,06/20/2023
"Does that also  those targets apply to the other purveyors other than the Board of Water Supply, or these action items  basically, you control all of those a hundred percent? As we go into the different regions, how are those going to be managed, under whose auspices?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"That's a really good question. I mean, this is one of the challenges, right, with having the county developing a water use development plan that applies to private water purveyors and other users. So in terms of the county agencies investing in recycled water expansion, stormwater use, etc., you know, the plan does that, so it's  that  this is also the driver or the guidance for capital improvement program and budget priorities for other agencies that, you know, recycle water falls under the Department of Environmental Management, etc. For private purveyors, you know, there's subtle incentives in the plans, and there are other  there are tools that on the county level can be  we can implement strategies through land use controls or land use approvals. So if this is, say, in a new development, the strategy in the water use development plan is to use x resource, and that project comes in for land use approvals, and we ask the planning commission to  look at that as a guidance, and we put those comments in already in discretion of permit review. But yeah, we don't  obviously, we don't have the authority to impose conservation or allocations on the private providers. That's, you know",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, I think that's a good model to be actively commenting on land use issues. Good. Thank you.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Yes, I have a comment. Thanks, Eva. I think one thing that  I'm excited to hear what Director Stufflebean said. You know, I mean, one thing, it sounds like Maui DWS can do a  sort of set the pace and set an example with, say, Smart Metering and kind of setting new standards for monitoring uses and  and conservation. I know it's not in the plan, but it would be exciting to see  you know, as you guys get more data and more real-time data, to be able to have dashboards or something and  and it doesn't need to be put in the plan, but just to have that in mind as to where things  where you folks maybe can take it. I think Maui is really setting  has the opportunity to set new models for the rest of the islands given the whole array of challenges and opportunities, so  Yeah, thanks for articulating that, I guess, and  us kind of listen and see where some of those gaps are too. You know, because if you guys set  set an example, then maybe the  it allows us as a commission to then point out to the other private purveyors like, Hey, look, it's doable, and we should all be doing this in terms of conservation and kind of innovating. So, kind of appreciate the work that's been put in to take in that feedback and  and be more responsive.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Great comment. Thank you.  Any other questions?   Eva, did you want to  did you want to add anything more to the discussion? Because",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Well, thank you, Chair. Well, I just want to really say we really appreciate the  both the commission staff and the deputy that they  you know, they're taking the time to scrutinize the plan and to further engage with the community members, you know, after this went through council here on our end. So, yeah, I just want to assure you, you know, every voice that came forward was heard and considered to craft these strategies, and we think that the  the proposed conditions in the staff's submittal, you know, we can do that, that can be implemented, and that would allow the plan, you know, to go forward. Oh, I want to respond also to Commissioner Hannah's question  or was it the Chair's question on what happens ithe plan is not approved. So as Director Stufflebean  you know, he gave a couple of examples of how we already lean on the plan. We're using it as the guidance for capital improvement programs and budget priorities. You know, it was adopted by ordinance. But, of course, the plan has a dual function. It should be a guidance document for the commission as well, so  so I think that is  you know, for us, if it was not approved, the next update will go through the whole process again with community engagement, going to our board, public hearings, new council review and approval. But if it's not approved by the commission, of course, it's not incorporated into the Hawai‘i Water Plan, so you  you don't have a tool, you know, to serve that purpose. I think that would be the real downside, you know. There's a lot of valuable guidance in there, we believe, for the  for the commission as well. So yes, I mean, we feel this is already  we're gonna continue scoping out project strategies in the plan so there will be even more opportunity for community participation there over the time, so  even revisiting demand and supply as we're scoping out this project. So it's a living document. And I just want to mahalo everyone that put so much effort into the process.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"All right. So I do have a quick question on the living nature of the document. Right now, it's a PDF posted to the county website, and as itJune  gets updated, I noticed some sections had the draft watermark. Does that mean the  the document itself will be versioned, or is it going to be  I want to understand how the public is going to access the living document as it gets updated. Just the technical details, yeah.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Yeah, yeah. So the PDF document that now has the links to come from the table of content, we have the draft watermark removed, of course, then I think you have the tracking  the matrix of  you know, the summary of the implementation of the strategies and, you know, a tracking sheet. So we will have that available to the public as well, so that's something that gets shared with our land use planning departments, our board, and council as needed so we can kind of just track and see how that evolves over time. Then in further updates of the plan, I'm pretty sure we're not going to tackle the island as a whole again. It could be by aquifer sector or by, you know, watershed or moku or whatnot, so that way, it's a little more manageable. I mean, it's still, you know, a year-long process, but  so I see that as the updates are done, you know, it would be focused on  on a particular aquifer sector and the same thing, just posted, you know, for  for public review as we go through that process.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"I have a simple suggestion. Actually, I started doing it. You can create a navigation pane in PDF, so a senior version, because it allows you to navigate from page 1300 back to the TOC back to  you know, and jump around sections. So I think that would ease access and review and feedback and maybe ameliorate any kind of frustrations. So, thank you.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"No, thank you. That was very helpful.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Eva, what's the status of the Molokai and Lanai Water Use Development Plans?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Mahalo, Commissioner. We have the consultant, Townscape, halfway through, a little more than halfway through, updating the Molokai Water Use and Development Plan. A lot of the community engagement is completed, demand projections are done, and we're now vetting resource options or presenting resource options to the community. So they have still a ways to go. We put in  we had funding approved for this next fiscal year, FY '24, to commission a consultant to help us update the Lanai Water Use and Development Plan. So, you know, it's a multi-year process, but thinking, you know, we'll contract towards the end of this year to begin that process.",1,B1,06/20/2023
So what  where do you view the horizon for these plans that you'll have something that  to present?,1,B1,06/20/2023
"So for  for Molokai, I'd say earliest March 2024 to be  a draft plan to be presented to our board. We will brief the commission at the same time. The board has 180 days to review and provide their comments before we present a bill for an ordinance to our county council. This Maui plan took three years through county council, so I'm not guaranteeing how long that's gonna take.  (Laughter.)",1,B1,06/20/2023
"You know, as soon as that's been adopted, then it'd be presented to the commission. And for Lanai, I would say, you know, a minimum of three years as well.",1,B1,06/20/2023
And I will also mention that the Molokai Plan will be  there will be a briefing (inaudible) group that are the consultants to the commission.,1,B1,06/20/2023
So we are going to organize that.,1,B1,06/20/2023
"Great, that's great. Super, thank you.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"There  just to add, there's going to be a bunch of planning components of the Hawai‘i  parts of the Hawai‘i Water Plan coming to the commission. Oahu, we have a couple that the board wants to present on as well. We're trying not to have more than one per meeting because it's so thick and it's robust, and it is a planning document so it's just trying to manage the agendas, but they're coming. You will  you will see a bunch of these planning documents coming in the near future.",1,B1,06/20/2023
Very good.Any other questions?(No response.),1,B1,06/20/2023
"Eva, this is a rather large document. Is it nimble enough? 'Cause you say it's a  it's a living document, but I'm assuming you also use  utilize the adaptive management approach that  as things change. Do you feel that the document and the process is nimble enough that as you get information, you can make appropriate  whether it's changes or updates? And how does that work out as a practical matter?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Thank you, Chair. I appreciate that. And I think we're still figuring out, you know, for the different kind of strategies, how we apply them, but in general, I mean, we use it frequently because, I mean, this is  since it was adopted by council, it kind of gives us the justification to, you know, whether it's investing in water resource protection or, you know, well-head protection or funding projects, so  so as a tool, it is useful, you know. We have  we have the implementation matrix to refer to. But in terms of updating data for  I mean, for example, we have  we're looking at feasibility studies to assess resources in different aquifer systems right now, and part of that process, we have a consultant kind of vet or revisit the demand and supply projections to see, are they still valid? You know, they were done  they're five years old and whatnot. Then, you know, turns out they're fairly valid, but for Central  so, for example, we had projected we need another 8 million gallons a day by year 2035; turns out we need 11 mgd by year 2040. So it's  it's a living document in that it's constantly  you know, we track private purveyors' water use, those that report, and we track our own water use, obviously, and kind of adjust those projections as we go and as projects are scoped out.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"No, thank you, that's very helpful. I mean, I think it is helpful to have a document that can be sort of the central location of current information, you know, a framework for planning, but it is helpful to have the document that is, you know, constantly updated and reflects real-time, but it is something  a document that it's not  it can be a guiding document for more than just government or the county, but others as well, so that's good. Okay, thank you very much. Any other questions? I've also  thank you, Eva, and thank you, John, for your testimony, your comments. I also have on  is it Gina Young? Is Gina on?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"I don't see her, Chair",1,B1,06/20/2023
Is Don Lono?  (No response.),1,B1,06/20/2023
"Nope. Anybody else, then, Kathy, on the line  on Zoom?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Those are my committee staff members, Chair.",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Oh, okay, all right. Thank you.  Is there anyone else in  on Zoom that would like to participate or provide us a comment on Item B-1?  (No response.)",1,B1,06/20/2023
Okay. Seeing no hands being raised.,1,B1,06/20/2023
Move to approve Item B-1.,1,B1,06/20/2023
"Okay, I have a motion to approve. Do I have a second?",1,B1,06/20/2023
"Okay, very good. I have two seconds and  a motion and two seconds. All in favor, say aye.  (Response.)",1,B1,06/20/2023
Any opposed?  (No response.),1,B1,06/20/2023
The motion has been unanimously approved.,1,B1,06/20/2023
To approve B-1 as submitted. UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED  (Applause.),1,B1,06/20/2023
"Derrick’s Well Drilling & Pump Services, LLC, Application for Well Construction and Pump Installation Permits, Wai Well (State Well No. 8-3802- 016), TMK (3) 1-6-141:024; Kea‘au Aquifer System Area, Hawai‘i",1,B2,03/19/2024
"PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Ryan Imata, Ground Water Regulation Branch Chief Staff requested that the Commission approve the application for both well and pump permits with a pump capacity of 450 gpm (0.096 mgd) for a water bottling plant.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"I have a question for the applicant because there are some discrepancies in the application where there’s pump capacity at 450 GPM and expected use 0.096 million gallons per day, but later on in the cultural impact assessment the number 0.482 MGD. With a 450 GPM and if you’re running full-time, it’s .65 MGD, what’s the actual usage because we’re not in a designated area so there isn’t reporting but the pumps...",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Okay, but what’s the actual use because there are two different numbers presented.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"After the pump test, under this new scheme, do you come back to the Commission to report or is your section delegated the authority to change the MGD based on your study?",1,B2,03/19/2024
"That’s kind of uncharted water because this is the first one that we’re presenting to you. I see two ways to look at it, one way is you could delegate authority to the chair to approve the production of a pump installation permit to where there are no adverse impacts associated with it or you could require us to bring it back to the Commission. I can see it one of two ways. I was thinking about that as I was presenting the pump test and what’s the procedure. Again, this is the first time we’ve done it so I don’t know. It’s certainly up to you guys.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Then your rules, do your rules define adverse effect?",1,B2,03/19/2024
"No, what we do look at is in our geologist analyzing the pump test, they’ll take the constant rate pump test and they’ll evaluate it to see if there are any what we call recharge boundaries. We plot the draw down of the well on a logarithmic graph. As a pump test goes on you’re going to see the water start reducing and then if all of a sudden the reduction of the water level just kind of slows down, you hit a recharge boundary. So are you starting to impact a stream or it’s starting to impact some other resource and that’s the avenue by which we might not at that point restrict the pump, but we might require more effort into figuring out what that is. One possible way, I don’t think that’s applicable here but one possible is requiring somebody to amend the instream flow standard if they’re impacting surface water. There are strategies that we employ to either reduce the pump capacity or have them apply mitigative components. I can tell you that I don’t think we’ve ever looked at a pump test and saw that. There might have been one like 25 years ago.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"It’s just a math question. At 450 gallons a minute, how does that equate to the 0.096 million gallons per day?",1,B2,03/19/2024
It doesn’t. Normally the 0.096 is what they put on their application as what they think they’ll need. What we do is we always go and we multiply 450 gallons per minute x 60 x 24.,1,B2,03/19/2024
That’s a normal capacity.,1,B2,03/19/2024
"We check what the maximum is and understand that if they’re going to pump 0.096, they might be pumping for two or three hours or something like. I think most wells don’t want to pump for 24 hours.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"my experience is that once you start a well you don’t want to turn it off because restarting wells to get that inertia is very expensive. Anyway, that’s not my question, just the clarity in the math. Can you refresh my memory on the process of these permits? This seems like a pretty modest water usage in a non-water management area. Where is the demarcation between what you bring to the Commission versus something that you would handle as an administrative and that we can delegate to the chair? In all the impacts that you’ve described, it seems that there are resolutions that will not endanger the aquifer or the water resources in that area that we need to address as a commission. Kind of help me through what the evolution of this process is.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"I’m actually eager to talk about that. The Commission had a requirement to approve well and pump permits but as staff was presenting to the commission, the agendas were like super long because we had 10 or 12 wells coming before the Commission that were very routine and have very minimal potential impacts for the resource, quantity wise. In an effort to delegate authority to the chair to approve those permits, we developed the Hawaii Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards in 1997. Through the adoption of the well standards, it was determined that if a well complies with all of those standards, those standards are designed to make sure that there’s not going to be impacts on the environment. It’s not just from a pumping standpoint it’s also from the standpoint of if you drill a bore hole and you install a casing in there, is there adequate grout there to protect contaminant from coming down? The well standards are designed around much more than just pumping in and of itself, but pumpage is a big part of that. That’s why we require pump tests and that’s why we require staff to approve those pump tests prior to us finalizing and saying and endorsing the pump size that’s installed. Fast forward to December of last year and the Commission made a decision to instead of delegating authority to the chair to approve all permits, the decision was made for anything that was not an individual domestic well to come to the Commission even if it complied with the Hawaii Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards. That’s where we are today. I can opine but that’s certainly not within my capacity.",1,B2,03/19/2024
I think that’s for this side of the table but thank you.,1,B2,03/19/2024
"I have a technical one. Since we’re learning about these details, can you explain how a step draw down test tells you different things than a constantly? How does it work?",1,B2,03/19/2024
"I’m not the best at understanding the step draw down test, but basically it’s a step draw down test but it’s actually increasing, it’s not decreasing the pumping rate. You have to have a variable speed on the pump, so you throttle it down. I’ve seen a pump test where he actually throttled it down with the valve and you can imagine valving off a pressure that’s pumping like 500 GPM. The whole assembly was shaking. There are variable speed pumps that you can put in to vary the rate or you can throttle down a permanent pump that can only run at one rate. The drillers here, they can expand on that too. Basically, looking at three discrete pump rates allows us to establish or determine certain aquifer properties and I can’t tell you technically how that’s done but we can determine like transmissivity and storage values which are data points that we put into our database so that we can understand the aquifer. The step draw down test really is for us to understand aquifer properties, whereas the constant rate test is looking more at the production or the productivity of the well and the impacts to salinity draw down. Roy Hardy is probably watching.",1,B2,03/19/2024
More questions for an offline science conversation already for me.,1,B2,03/19/2024
"Just to make it clear on this pump rates of 450 gallons per minute, you should put the total pump capacity, which is probably like 0.6 MGD, then in a separate statement saying that the applicant tends to use 96,000 gallons per day or whatever it is.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"No, I just kind of peaked my math skills on this.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"On your nine-point checklist, I’m curious. We have an affirmative duty to protect the public trust and the way in which these are addressed in points 5 and 9 really focus on archaeology or historic structures. I think it kind of misses some of what has often come before us as traditional customary practices. In this case the applicant did a really nice job with their cultural impact survey, so that really helps us. Is there a way you can recognize that in your process? Like point 10, that they clearly articulate because we’ve seen applications that don’t and I think we want to incentivize that for applicants. If you want it to sail through, do your homework before. We don’t have the time to follow up on it but that they demonstrated they’ve given us information to feel good about approving or disapproving. That’s my only feedback to you.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Thank you for raising that and that aligns with some points that Chair Chang wanted me to make with respect to Ka Paʻakai Analysis. Feeling like the record needs to be strengthened so that we’re making decisions based on a record and so it needs to be explicit in that record, not implied or something that you could extrapolate or calculate what our findings are. With respect to the identification of valued cultural, historical, and natural resources in the project area including traditional customary Hawaiian rights, in addition to what’s indicated in the report, she wishes to add the fact that, for the record, in addition to publishing a notice, staff also reviewed or the applicant also reviewed Kepa Maly’s report identifying resources along the coast of Keaʻau but none in the project area. The project area was formerly pasture land for cattle and therefore subject to grazing and excavation for the slaughter house. She’d like that language specifically inserted into the record. Secondly, with respect to the extent to which those resources will be impacted or impaired by the proposed project, we have a finding based upon the CIA(Cultural Impact Statement), based upon the record that’s there, there were no identified impacts of the proposed project on traditional customary practices. That’s the second point Chair would like to make explicit. Finally, in terms of any feasible action that should be taken based upon the CIA, there appears to be no feasible action that should be taken by WC, the applicant, in granting the water permit. It’s left there for us to conclude and the chair would like that those conclusions to be really explicit in the record.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"So, clarification, she wants those statements made by staff in our submittal?",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Yes, after you looked at the CIA and so forth, these are your explicit findings.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Got it, so I think that what we’re providing here are the answers from the applicant, but we need to make definitive statements in terms...",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Based upon the record of the applicant, this is what we conclude. I think it’s a matter of a normal process and rigor that you would like in addressing our Ka Paʻakai Analysis.",1,B2,03/19/2024
This is in a water management area?,1,B2,03/19/2024
"Now that’s my issue and also with the Ota Well. My understanding is in an area governed by the common law, the Commission has permit authority over well construction and pump installation but it has doesn’t have authority for water use permit. On the other hand, it seems to me that in both this case and the Ota case we’re actually going step by step even though it’s not called a permit, putting such conditions on the water use that it is becoming a permit. I want to know for example in this case, what kinds of requirements are you having on how much water is actually being drawn because besides not being a permit, it is still a public trust resource and the use should be reasonable and necessary. But how do we make a distinction between deciding on the water use in a permit in a water management area, in a non-water management area?",1,B2,03/19/2024
"That’s a question for me? I will just say that in a non-management area one would have correlative rights and I think that on the one hand, we need to assure that people are not wasting water to address what you said. You can’t waste water, but at the same time if you’re in a non-management area and the Commission doesn’t issue allocations and require somebody to show that their use is reasonable and beneficial, then what’s the regulatory mechanism to require someone reduce their pumpage to a certain use? We’re in this regulatory, nebulous region where we don’t have an allocation. It’s my thought that in a non-management area, someone can change their use tomorrow to use it for pasture irrigation or something else. There’s no establishment of what a reasonable and beneficial use is. I think it’s a hard thing in a non-management area. The other way is that designated as a management area, you can control what people are using it for as reasonable and beneficial uses.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"What I’m a little disturbed about is that what happens then in a non-water management area. Really the only people that legally speaking would be harmed were other people that have water rights under the common law. You have to watch out about that but we don’t have any direct way to make sure that it’s reasonable and necessary. Remember, the original legislative proposal was to make the entire state a water management area and the compromise was the situation we have now. I’ve always been disturbed about how the hell we deal with water in non-management areas and in the past you just said, okay we’re going to do it through a well construction and pump insulation permit, but after that you really can’t say anything about how much water they’re going to be using because you don’t really know. That’s why I asked the question of how are we dealing with wells in these kinds of situations. In the surface water area, at least we have interim instream flow standards which can limit how much water, you can’t dewater the stream, but in this particular case we don’t have anything that says you can’t go beyond even what would be endangering to the aquifer. I remember the ʻĪao aquifer system where we were at 100% and we still weren’t designating it, which I thought was kind of a crazy situation at that time. Anyway, maybe we can discuss this more with the later discussion on the Ota, which by the way I tried to find information on what the hell the Ota Well is and I can’t find anything on that issue.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Did you want to respond to Commissioner Miike or Dean? Did you want to respond further, this nebulous area?",1,B2,03/19/2024
"I would almost equate instream flow standards as sustainable yield, too. We have two regulatory mechanisms to make sure there’s no harm. Number one, there’s the pump test and despite the fact that they can change the use tomorrow, they can’t increase the pump from 450 to 500 GPM without coming back to the commission. So based on the pump test we should understand what 450 gallon per minute impact is going to have...",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Hang on for a second, let me ask you a question. You said that if they decided to up the pumpage, they can’t do it before coming back to the commission, but what criteria would you have to deny that under a non-water management area? What can you do to say you can’t do that?",1,B2,03/19/2024
Requiring them to run another pump test that is in compliance with the standard.,1,B2,03/19/2024
"But as long as the pump test and everything else is okay, you can’t really stop them can you?",1,B2,03/19/2024
"That would meet the second factor is that once you get up to close to sustainable yield, you could designate and then like what happened in Lahaina, now it’s designated and now everybody that was using a certain quantity of water now has to prove that it’s reasonable and beneficial. I’m not saying it’s correct, but I’m saying that the establishment of reasonable and beneficial use happens at the point where the aquifer is pushed to the extent of sustainable yield.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"But that’s my problem. Up to that point, you can’t do anything. You got to wait till they start endangering the aquifer before you can act.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Right, but there’s two parts to it. There’s the pump capacity and there’s a reasonable and beneficial component. On the one hand, we have no ability to establish whether a use is reasonable and beneficial, but we can definitely limit the pump capacity and that to me is going to have the impacts on the resource regardless of what the reasonable and beneficial use is. Someone could say that water bottling for a million gallons per day is reasonable and beneficial but that might have impacts on the aquifer and so we restrict the pump capacity as the protection of the aquifer. Does that make sense?",1,B2,03/19/2024
"But you’re still not able to in a particular well put a limit on it as long as the aquifer is not in danger. That’s a discussion for another time, but it’s always bothered me that we have limited authority in a non-water management area but we seem to be creeping toward a permit system in a non-water management area.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Maybe a thought and a suggestion and idea, you probably have a lot of data from various pump tests. Has anyone in staff ever worked to put that data together to do some modeling and then anticipate? You can ramp it up, if everybody had their pumps at max versus if they had it at 75 and you could run simulations to see. That’s maybe not within the staff’s but partnering with USGS or partnering with to anticipate that kind of stuff and help come back. Every single well might be okay but we might be depleting discharge in the nearshore fisheries. No individual well owner has the capacity or knowledge or skills to do that, but it is our responsibility so maybe that’s something, an extended discussion. We have data, we need to make use of it and use it to inform. You’re smiling and nodding, you’ve had this conversation.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"As a matter of fact, the one thing that we are sorely lacking within Groundwater Regulation Branch or what I’m proposing to reorganize the groundwater branch is that particular expertise. My intent is to convert my hydrologist into a groundwater analyst so that we can put all this data together and somebody can manage contracts with GS or partner to implement groundwater modeling based on what you’re saying. I’m kind of anticipating that. As of right now we don’t have the capacity of staff to really even drive the discussion. Roy had modeling experience but we don’t have that experience.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"It exists so whoever is listening, it exists.",1,B2,03/19/2024
I definitely want to go in that direction.,1,B2,03/19/2024
"I think to help with Larry’s point of view, when we have a 450 gallon per minute pump rather than recognizing what the intended use is at 0.96 MGD, you should really put in the full pump capacity and use that as your benchmark for the allocation. What the applicant wants to do or wants to use, it’s up to them, but then again you have a cap on it that they cannot exceed on a 24-hour period. Going back to a sustainable yield calculation, if all the pumps are turned on every day for 24 hours a day.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"My name is Joshua Delary, I’m the director of production and engineering for Waiakea Water.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"I’m Jay Malloe, I’m director of quality at Waiakea Water.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"We are here representing Waiakea Water. Thank you, I actually got really intrigued with all your questions and a lot of things that we do that we actually like to be involved in, that aspect as well as testing samples, stuff like that. This permit is for us to drill a new well for our facility adjacent to our other two wells there.",1,B2,03/19/2024
What’s the expected per day usage because there’s some very different numbers?,1,B2,03/19/2024
"Yes, there is very different numbers. The numbers that we utilize, we actually track every drop that comes out of the ground. We have flow meters on all of our pumps, our well technicians, our staff there at the well record every fill going into our tanker. Every drop that is taken out is recorded through our flow meter. The current usage that we’re doing, it’s about 18 minutes to fill. It’s got an 18-minute run time on our pump and that’s for 6,000 gallons, so it’s not a constant 24-hour run time.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"That’s where the 96,000 gallons per day comes from. Then there was a 482,000 gallons per day number in the cultural EIS. Was that for the whole facility?",1,B2,03/19/2024
"I think that was probably for the whole, I’m not 100% sure on that.",1,B2,03/19/2024
That number is way too high compared to what you folks are anticipating?,1,B2,03/19/2024
"I just wanted that clarification, thank you.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Aloha mai kākou, for the record my name is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer. I’m testifying in my individual capacity on this particular item. To start off, I really have no particular concern with this proposed well, but I want to just respond to some of the dialogue between Ryan Imata and Commissioner Miike because Commissioner Miike was offering some really thoughtful questions about the limitations of the commission’s powers in non-designated areas. I just want to give some response to some of the things Ryan said because I think it’s really important for the Commission to understand this in relationship to this agenda item, the upcoming Ota Well item and other things. There was an assertion, if I heard it correctly, that two ways in which public trust and other interests in water are protected in non-designated areas are through the management of sustainable yield and through the use of pumps. I just want to be really clear and this has been an area of scholarship of mine, first of all five-day pump tests or four-day pump tests are not designed to assess impacts on public trust resources. If the well is far from the coast or from a stream or another resource that you’re caring about, you very well will have long-term impacts on a public trust resource and it’s not going to be detectable by a 5-day pump test. A 5-day pump test will detect potentially, if there’s no geological blocking that impacts on nearby wells. Secondly, just to be really clear the way the Water Commission has set sustainable yields, it’s actually not analogous to how instream flow standards are set, it’s actually the opposite because you set instream flow standards by first determining the minimum amount of water that’s needed to protect public trust resources in the stream. The way the State, the Water Commission has chosen to set sustainable yields is actually to determine the maximum amount of water you think you can extract. It actually starts rather than a precautionary approach, with an extractive approach and to be really clear sustainable yield is not designed to protect public trust resources. You can pump all you want from Launiupoko or the Honokowai aquifers below sustainable yield and not restore important public trust resources like Mokuhinia. You can completely harm fish ponds, anchialine pools, the nearshore environment at pumping rates far below sustainability. It has to do with where the well location is, how deep the well is, and how much it’s pumping. In terms of as you figure out your process for what’s delegated, not delegated and how you consider non-delegated permits and non-designated water management areas, I just think you need to keep in mind you can’t rely on pump tests and sustainable yield as any assurance that you’re fulfilling your duties in terms of protecting public trust resources. I feel very strongly about it, sorry if my tone was a little strident on this one, but it is something that I [inaudible] you guys have come to a conclusion. I’m happy to answer any questions, thank you for listening.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"Just to answer Jonathan, sustainable yield is whatever the Commission decides is sustainable yield so he does have a valid point which is that it’s not just based on the science of how much water you can draw out of it, but also the effects on other things. We’ve always stuck to more or less a quantitative approach. I don’t know how you deal with trying to put in other factors, but Jonathan does have a good point.",1,B2,03/19/2024
I would suggest that we discuss the topic more thoroughly in executive session at some point in the future.,1,B2,03/19/2024
Would you like to go in now?,1,B2,03/19/2024
"I don’t think it needs to happen right now, this is a larger issue.",1,B2,03/19/2024
You wanted to view all of these permits.,1,B2,03/19/2024
"Let me be clear about that. When I came on board, it was with respect to delegation, I felt that the Commission makes policy and the Commission should be aware of what’s being delegated. I did ask staff to inventory for me all of the delegation authorities, what has been delegated and their reliance on a 1997 action was outdated. I think it did require um a more thorough review given the changes both in law and in facts and in the situation of water. We have Ka Paʻakai Analysis that we utilize, we have the environmental considerations, we have a much more engaged community; therefore, for me I did have some concerns about what should be delegated and what should be administrative or ministerial. I wanted that to come before the Commission for guidance, so I am not wetted in stone that everything should come before the commission. In the past we talked about many of those water well permits dealing with Hawaiian Paradise domestic use. Their usage is actually very small, it’s necessary, therefore domestic use to me. That’s a category I think the Commission can make, a decision that can be delegated to the chair and delegated to the first deputy. When we were talking about the Hāpuna well, there were comments about how should we address that so I am more looking for guidance...",1,B2,03/19/2024
Can we try to stick to the item?,1,B2,03/19/2024
"Fair enough, I just wanted to explain myself. Back to the agenda item.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"I think the applicant, I appreciated the job that they did on the cultural impact assessment and I would like us to keep on that in the future.",1,B2,03/19/2024
"I do think it is important that the Commission makes specific findings, I do believe that is what the court has required us to do on actions. I went through all the documents and I did appreciate that the cultural impact assessment was prepared which gave me the facts upon which...but I do believe that is the commission’s obligation to do that.",1,B2,03/19/2024
MOTION: (KATAYAMA / HANNAHS)To approve staff recommendation as submitted.,1,B2,03/19/2024
Briefing by Maui Department of Water Supply on the Development of a Water Shortage and Conservation Plan for Department Water Systems,0,B1,02/20/2024
"Mr. Neal Fujii, CWRM, introduced Ms. Blumenstein, planning program manager and Ms. Fritsche, consultant who provided a briefing on Maui DWS’ water shortage plan, water conservation plan, and next steps in the process.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"I have a question on the Stage 3 groundwater with the chloride levels. What’s the relationship with that target versus degradation of the aquifer where it has difficulty recovering? When you get down, fairly high chloride levels, it takes a while for the aquifer to recover. I’m wondering if you have any idea about the relationship with Stage 3 versus the difficulty of the aquifer getting back to drinkable water?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Mahalo, Commissioner. I can just get started and turn over to Jessica, as well. That’s an excellent question and one I have pondered for some specific well fields that have historically had spikes of very high chlorides such as the Kanahā wells in Launiupoko Aquifer that has through two decades recovered. But we don’t really know what that threshold is, will this well field recover? Is it detrimental to the aquifer? For those purposes as Jessica mentioned, they based the chloride or 95% of the Stage 3 chlorides on the findings from the USGS 2012 report on groundwater availability in Lahaina. There are other areas where, in ʻĪao Aquifer the Mokuhau well fields, for example, have seen some excessive chlorides over the years where it has recovered. But we do not know what that upper threshold is where you could have a damage to aquifer. This is just based on the historic production and chlorides data that we’ve seen for each system. Jessica, if you want to add anything?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Perhaps you should also have some target where you don’t draw any water from that particular aquifer because the way your stages go, you keep drawing water. You’re trying to reduce demand, but I’m assuming that you’re still trying to draw water out of an endangered aquifer.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Ayron Strauch of the Stream Protection and Management Branch. To carry on that part of the conversation, in Kāʻanapali in the Honokōwai Aquifer, Hawaiʻi Water Service manages a well field there of seven or eight wells. Their wells quite rapidly hit that 250-500, even higher, chloride content. They just shut down the well for weeks, if not months and they transfer the pumpage to the other wells. Not that that helps with the County system because they have a limited well field, but it might benefit all parties if well pumpage gets distributed across the aquifer a little bit more evenly to increase the likelihood that any individual well that hits that target will recover rapidly.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"That’s part of this water shortage plan, although it wasn’t listed in any of these because it was focusing on demand, reducing demand?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"This example involved a private water system, Hawaiʻi Water Service, which isn’t part of the County water shortage plan, I don’t believe.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Let me ask the County, then. In your water shortage plans, would you also be doing what he has suggested that the private sector has done? Instead of just focusing on reducing demand, how about trying to do structural changes in your withdrawal from the aquifers?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Yes, and that’s what’s been done historically when you see those peaking chlorides, you turn off that pump or find other ways to distribute water throughout the system. The way Carollo Engineers has proposed the response actions are demand side, but it doesn’t mean that those correlate to supply, they really have to translate to supply side operation measures as well. I don’t know if Jessica wants to address that part.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"That’s part of the reason that we did the operational grouping of wells and we did the weighted production is because that is how the County operates now. When one well peaks in chlorides, they shut it down and they attempt operationally to get supply elsewhere. We did the groupings for that reason, we know they already have that flexibility in place and we didn’t want the triggers to be set on just a single well, speaking on chlorides, as historically that has happened. I can also just speak a little bit to the data and that historically the chlorides do go back to average levels following those peaks.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"I have a question related to the chlorides, as well. If it’s weighted production, that means some wells are going to be much, much higher than those thresholds, right? Because you’re looking at the system average at a given time. That suggests Maui is planning to exceed those secondary requirements. My question is, you’re considering single sets of thresholds for very different geologic and hydrologic context across the system and some of them have quicker and some of them have slower recovery. Could you fold in the best science? I remember Scot Izuka’s report on, I can’t quite remember. Ayron, do you remember the report he presented a year ago on pumping effects? Hydrogeology. Was that also from Maui?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Can we be sure that we’re considering that current science and that’s more recent than the 2014 report that you’re referencing. I know you guys want consistent triggers for groundwater, but some areas that you’re considering are wholly groundwater dependent while some of them are mixed. Maui can sort of mix to bring the chlorides down to remain in compliance, but for the areas that are 100% groundwater, wouldn’t you want to have more sensitive triggers? Would it make sense to do a little bit more tuning just for managing the aquifer and those very different geologic regions. Is that a question or comment? I guess it’s more a comment.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"This is what we wanted from you also because we’re still figuring out the final format and what’s going to work both operational and for the Department. This is again, protecting the resource, making it reasonable, mandates or actions we can impose on the public. It may need to have a little more site specific while not being too...like Jessica said, we looked at well fields both from an operational standpoint and chlorides standpoint. Those ultimately is going to be how we implement the plan, but the way it’s presented here for the triggers, you’re just seeing the triggers for the whole system or district like Lahaina or Upcountry. In Central, it’s actually 8 or 9 well fields.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"You have systems that have more or less spatially distributed wells, so your system vulnerability is different, tuning for that. I have a follow-up question for Commission staff which is, the utility is focusing on what it can measure, chlorides? But that doesn’t always address what we’re responsible for which is the effects on decreased spring flow or streamflow. We’re going to need to help provide information to them on that. Ayron, I don’t know if you have comments.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"We are working on a comprehensive monitoring network with the County of Maui and they’ve been great cooperators with the USGS stream and groundwater monitoring across the county. There might be some issues with some of their metrics like 50% of the three-year average daily flow might not capture the acute stresses that are occurring on a three-week or four-week window, especially if there is no storage. That might affect both on the use side as well as the resource side. There are many ways to communicate hydrological drought and it’s not necessarily meteorological drought, but things that are affecting instream resources that we also need to consider. There are many ways to talk about the data that could be a little bit more effective.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"This is really a question for Eva. What would you think about including a requirement that understates three conditions for groundwater management, a well recovery/well management plan be submitted to CWRM for review and approval only within a reasonable time period, say 30 days or something like that and only under Stage 3 conditions for groundwater. Would that be too much of a burden? Do you think it would be a reasonable requirement? Addressing the question of well recovery.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Maybe that should be already proactively defined. We sort of anticipate where those problem areas are, at least the well fields where we have seen a spike in chlorides and we know they have recovered operationally before. For sure for some areas there’s been up coning such as Mokuhau well field. If that was defined specifically in the shortage plan for the water use permit, that might be helpful now that that’s defined upfront. The trigger would be when we’re in the Stage 3.",0,B1,02/20/2024
It may not be necessary. CWRM could probably do something later if it was necessary but having it in there might be a road sign and provide some level of assurances that the utilities are watching the recovery program as well.,0,B1,02/20/2024
"For my own education, this plan, I presume, focuses on DOW (Department of Water) reach and you mentioned that you have an ordinance pending before the Maui Commission, as well?",0,B1,02/20/2024
We have a draft ordinance that we are tweaking now based on the feedback from Carollo Engineers’ analysis. We hope to propose that in May.,0,B1,02/20/2024
"My question and if you can help me with this, as you go through the various stages that you have outlined, what are your management tools/compliance ability and do you have the ability to reach out to other purveyors that are comingled with your resources? Or is this water plan just focused on the DOW resources?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Yes and no. We only have jurisdiction over our system and our sources, but we recognize this problem and challenge going back a decade and more, of course. Both in terms of there is a resource impact, not just an individual well operational capacity impact, it doesn’t matter who owns the source. We all lose if we are having a deteriorating aquifer or stream. For those reasons, we made a point in the scope here that we want to address both potential interconnections and shortage triggers of private purveyors. That’s why that’s the formal part of the scope, we’re meeting with the larger purveyors, the West Maui, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands on Molokaʻi, to explore what are the opportunities. Can you just buy in to this shortage trigger? Should they be different? Can we have contingency agreements with what we do in a shortage, including system connections? In terms of the bill that would impose some mandatory restrictions on water behavior, we are proposing some of those provisions would apply to private systems as well. That would make sense in terms of irrigation schedules, even though the County doesn’t have jurisdiction, we cannot pull their meter, it’s more like a buy-in from those systems to be consistent throughout the county when it comes to customer behavior and the severity of restrictions.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"In the overall management of the system, who would be the organization responsible to ensure that the water systems remain intact?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"The individual public water systems are responsible to ensure that we can meet demand. This is where we kind of needed assistance with defining that. We didn’t have clear indicators or triggers. It also left a lot of uncertainty on the customer side. Like , if we’re in a Stage 2, are these reasonable reductions and will we accomplish the needed reduction with those measures? That is what we engaged Carollo to do.",0,B1,02/20/2024
Is there a compliance element to this?,0,B1,02/20/2024
"Yes, from the more critical stages especially if you’re in 2 to contemplating 3. Is there an organization that will ensure there is compliance?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Yes, for the Department, this would amend the existing County code. The compliance and enforcement of that now is fines and the last resort is the pulling of your water meter. We haven’t proposed any changes to the enforcement and penalties on it. If the County decides to adopt a bill that expands these restrictions to private purveyors, we don’t have that ability to monitor or enforce. That’s what I’m talking about, we need the buy-in from those to have similar enforcement mechanisms in place.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Ok, thank you, Eva.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Since we’re talking about Water Management Areas, the Commission has the power to limit the permit amounts, whether it be a County or private. At least from our side, we can do an overall reduction and I suppose that leaves it up to the purveyor to decide how they’re going to reduce allotment. We do have some powers over that.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Dean, the bill on the emergency water shortage, doesn’t that also address some of the issues that are being raised here?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Yes, the intent is to give us emergency powers regardless if it’s a water management area or not.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Right, that was one of the bills that was vetoed last year. Is that bill still alive this session?",0,B1,02/20/2024
Only in Senate Bill 3327.,0,B1,02/20/2024
"It’s part of the larger bill. Not the individual bill, but as part of the overall. We’ll discuss that. Commissioner Hannahs isn’t here, but he raised a similar question to Wayne’s question. This is a DWS report, but it seems like it deserves a broader reach with the private purveyors. Eva, you mentioned that part of this plan was to reach out to the various other stakeholders, private purveyors, also Hawaiian Home Lands. What was the response from these stakeholders to the draft water management shortage plan?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"The community engagement with the broader community was on the long-term conservation plan and where the community is going to be impacted. The shortage triggers, the potential interconnections, and contingency plans we are addressing next week, the next two weeks. We don’t have the feedback, of course you’re invited to the process and invited to participate, but we’re having one-on-one meetings with director and their management throughout the next two weeks, too. So, I don’t know yet.",0,B1,02/20/2024
That really is a missing component to this plan. Any other questions? I’m assuming there are members of the public who have signed up to provide comments to the Maui County’s plan.,0,B1,02/20/2024
"This is for Neal, Planning Branch, I assume you have some conversations with other private purveyors. Is Maui DWS the only entity working on this, especially for the designated areas? Do you have knowledge of how progress is with other purveyors? We eventually will need it, right?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Honolulu Board of Water Supply, they have their own conservation program. As far as a proper plan, they came out with their water shortage and recovery plan for Oʻahu specifically to address the Red Hill issue. Honolulu Board of Water Supply is very aggressive in their water conservation. You live on Oʻahu, you see all of their advertisements. Maui is a close second. You see the ordinances that have already been passed regarding water conservation, show me the water bill, there are the new golf courses, non-potable. They’re very progressive in that sense. Kauaʻi Water Department, they have a water conservation program, but I don’t know if they are developing a proper plan. The Big Island, they also have water conservation efforts, but as far as an actual plan written up, I have not seen that.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"What I was meaning specifically since we’re talking about Maui today, other private purveyors on Maui. For instance, on Oʻahu where we have Pearl Harbor water shortage plan, we have Board of Water Supply and the Navy’s water shortage plan, right? We have water shortage plans for every permitted or most permitted entities. Have you heard anything from other private purveyors or non- DWS purveyors on Maui about their work? Because it seems like we should be running these.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"In terms of water conservation, no, we haven’t hear from the private. On Maui, the big ones are on the West side. Hawaiʻi Water Service, I haven’t heard from them.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Maybe we can nudge while we’re all thinking about this together. And I bring this up because it’s anecdotal, what I’ve heard of Texas where they have different irrigation water districts. You have people who are progressive next to people who aren’t and the conservation in one district benefits another and there’s inter-district tension because of it. The whole point with management is that we consider all of these together.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Good point. In water management areas, the permit holders are required to submit a water shortage plan, which is what Eva is talking about and it’s going to be turned in as part of their application for a water use permit. Each of the permit applicants are supposed to submit a water shortage plan. Now, the water shortage plan is not the same as a conservation plan, but there are elements that are very similar and they blend into each other. For example, Maui’s shortage plan, their 0 stage is just their general conservation. That could be a model to follow. The Commission has some say in that when they issue the water use permits. The way it works is the Commission only adopted the Pearl Harbor Water Shortage Plan and the way that plan is we have three stages of shortage. In Stage 2 is where we ask the water use permit holders to implement their existing water shortage plan that they had submitted. That’s how it fits in the individual shortage plans versus the aquifer sector wide.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"I assume our CWRM side efforts will start moving shortly or in this calendar year as we consider permits and these submitted water shortage plans, is that correct?",0,B1,02/20/2024
What’s the question? Sorry.,0,B1,02/20/2024
"Maui DWS is really aggressively tackling this shortage plan right now. It would make sense for us to also think about our aquifer system area plan, as well. Maui DWS can encourage their other purveyors to do their part, but we also can so I think we should. And let us know if we can understand how the Commission is doing our part to consider water shortage. I think that would be a good sign of leadership. Let us know if we’re making progress on it.",0,B1,02/20/2024
Sure. We’ll keep you guys posted.,0,B1,02/20/2024
"There are several legislative bills that may have an impact on this. There are some tax incentive bills and hopefully with the County’s outreach, I’d be real curious to see.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"I want to mahalo you, also. We really look for your feedback here, comments, what you see is lacking or whatnot because there is a void right now. There isn’t a statewide or an aquifer or any shortage plan for any Maui County designated area. We understand the Commission will ultimately review, you can approve, or have us modify the plan. We’re really going to make the best effort to cover what’s needed both by district and site specific and our best effort to get buy-in from the private purveyors, but it’ll probably be a while. We have consulted with the Groundwater Branch, with Ryan Imata and Bob and Patrick in getting a better understanding of what triggers would make sense or not. There are still so many components, I heard just from Ayron that maybe we get some of the surface water triggers wrong. The earlier we can address those, the better. This plan is not final. Mahalo for any feedback, criticism, we’d like to hear.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Thank you for your work in this area, this is a really important plan and you’re right on point, as far as I’m concerned in terms of direction and the steps you’re taking. Thanks for the effort. You’ve got a very tight timeframe here in terms of getting this done. It’s aggressive and again, thank you, it’s admirable.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"I want to have an understanding on your BCAs (benefit cost analysis). Your BCAs, does that take into consideration the amount of water that’s being used? I look at, for example, irrigation and that has a really high value. Your BCA on that was 64.3, but the agricultural use is 4%. How is that calculated?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Thank you for the question. On the irrigation demands, we are looking also at turf grass irrigation and plants and that’s most of that. We’re actually not taking into account agricultural users in the conservation plan. We have BMPs as a recommended measurement, agriculture BMPs, Best Management Practices, in there but the irrigation measures that we’re speaking of targets watering of lawns essentially.",0,B1,02/20/2024
Your BCAs are reflective of the proportion of water use.,0,B1,02/20/2024
"The BCA estimates how much, implementing that measure, what would be the water conservation savings in gallons associated with that. The way that you get to the BCA, the benefits side of it, say DWS did not have to treat or pump that water. So there is a cost savings associated with saving that gallon of water. That is what’s in the numerator of that value and then there is a cost to implement that program. Because there’s the irrigation scheduling is really just marketing time and enforcement essentially, some labor hours in there, it’s marketing hours. There’s no fixture associated with it, you don’t have to give away a $100 rebate to replace a toilet, so there’s not a lot of material cost in there. That’s the reason that has such a high BCA value.",0,B1,02/20/2024
I see. I just want to make sure I’m comparing apples and apples and we’re managing community’s expectations.,0,B1,02/20/2024
"Aloha mai kākou. Thank you, Chair Chang, and members. For the record, my name is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer. I’m here today with the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. I have questions, but I understand I’m just addressing them to you. I will also address my praise for Eva to you, I share Commissioner Meyer’s gratitude for this work. It’s very important work. Certainly, I appreciated Neal’s description of where various counties are and it’s great that Maui is stepping ahead in a way that we would love to see all four counties step ahead in seriously addressing shortage and conservation issues. I have a few questions, one, and I appreciate the distinction Neal Fujii drew between the overlapping, yet distinct water conservation plans and water shortage plans. But I would like to reiterate that when DHHL was give the opportunity to review the draft Pearl Harbor Water Shortage Plan, and this was about three years ago, one of the questions we asked was do you have triggers related to potential contamination of the aquifer? The response of CWRM staff at the time was like that’s not for the shortage plans. It just seems that it might be useful in addition to these triggers around salinity and triggers around streamflow that should there be some event where contamination actually drives an inability for the system to deliver water, that that could also be some kind of trigger? Just a question. I’m not clear on how transparent the reporting on these triggers are so that interested members of the public will know, are we getting close? Are we not getting close? And then my fundamental set of questions have to do with whether and how equity was considered, equity and public trust principles were considered in the responses that are the 10%, 20%, 30% mandatory shortages. Across the board cuts, whether it’s of water or taxes or anything tend to have inadvertently inequitable outcomes. If you have a very large lawn and you have to reduce it by 10%, it’s different on your impact and your family’s than if you have a small garden. Right? That you’re taking care of and you have to reduce by 10%. Certainly, on Maui, both in the beneficiary community of Hawaiian Homes as well as the general community, there is often very frequently articulated concerns around water use between locals and tourists. Particularly given the challenges that were explored by you and your questions about public and private systems. Very, very frequently you hear folks Upcountry and Central Maui scratching their heads, wait, why can I not wash my car and then I look down at the resorts and everything is green and lush and the tourists are driving washed cars. Then also, particularly for DHHL, and I don’t necessarily have an answer for this, but if DHHL uses are a public trust use, why are they also cut across the board as non- public trust uses are during various levels of shortage. I’m not trying to express that there’s not a willingness by beneficiaries to reduce water in times of shortage, but what does it mean to have higher public trust use of water. And then fundamentally, I think, the last two points I’ll say is the articulation, if I heard it correctly from the Maui Department of Water Supply was that this allows for future growth in the system without developing additional sources. And so, I think a lot of folks just ask why are we concerned then? What is the ultimate goal to conserve water? And so, if I remember correctly and I often do not, but even during the 20- and 30% mandatory shortages Upcountry late last year, people were not complying, right?. And so, you have to ask why are people not complying? Do we have effective, as Commissioner Katayama was starting to question, enforcement mechanisms, monitoring mechanisms to do things. But I think also what drives compliance sometimes is if people feel that the rule is fundamentally inequitable, they tend to be a little less willing to comply with it. Those were just my comments, but again echo the deep appreciation for the work that MDWS is doing and we’re looking forward to our conversation about interconnections between their system and our system on Molokaʻi are going to be happening this coming week. Mahalo nui.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Thank you very much, Jonathan. Eva and Jessica are still online so I’m sure they’re taking all of comments that you’ve raised. Thank you so much. I’ll take people on Zoom. Kapua, did you want to provide a comment of B1?",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Aloha mai kākou, my name is Kapua Sproat, for the record. I’ve been tracking Maui issues for far too long. I’m here today in my personal capacity and like everyone else, I really want to mahalo Eva and the County for doing this important work and especially for sharing your progress with the community. I did have just a couple of things that I wanted to flag for the Commission, though some of my manaʻo has already been captured by the Commissioners and Dr. Strauch. I do have serious concerns about using mean surface water for the surface water triggers. I’m not sure what that means and as we all know given the historically low flows that Ayron has been measuring all over but especially on Maui and in the Wailuku River, I worry about using a three-year average which is what was flagged on slide 13. I hope that Eva will continue to closely coordinate with Dr. Strauch on those triggers and will incorporate a hard floor in addition to an average as well as the other issues that Dr. Strauch flagged. Same for the groundwater, I think there should be hard stops on individual wells so we’re not just mixing with surface water to make sure we get to where we need to with respect to chlorides. I’ll just underscore the point that Jonathan made with respect to the public trust prioritization across the board. We aren’t seeking equity, a lot of folks aren’t. They’re seeking justice and fairness, especially where surface water is being taken. I’d encourage the County to look at prior public trust prioritization in incorporating the cuts. This is a question for the County that doesn’t need to be answered now but just something to think about. I remember when the County opposed designation of Maui Komohana in June of 2022, it said no need because it was utilizing a working group in order to kind of coordinate with the other water purveyors. This is especially important as you folks well know in Maui Komohana where the County is less than 30% of the water that’s being provided. What’s the status of that? I think as Commissioner Katayama highlighted, coordination is going to be absolutely essential and if some of that is taking place, great. If the county rule isn’t amended and Eva isn’t able to enforce with respect to private purveyors, then I think the Commissioner’s role in water use permitting and the individual shortage plans are going to be even more important as Dr. Miike highlighted. Mahalo to everyone.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Good morning, Chair, members of the Commission. Wayne Tanaka for the Sierra Club of Hawaiʻi. Just have some comments, first I just really want to appreciate the information and the discussion that’s provided in this briefing. I really appreciate the stage zero concept and its emphasis on the importance of proactive efficiency and waste mitigation measures. Along those lines, I did want to emphasize a few areas where I think efficiency and waste mitigation could be improved, whether by the County or by the State or even through your own advocacy as individual experts and probably some of the most informed folks on water issues, current water issues Statewide. For one example, according to the County, its intake infrastructure at Kamole Weir requires on average about 2 million gallons of water more per day than what Upcountry actually uses. That’s about three quarters of a billion gallons per year and given how precious and increasingly scarce our water resources are becoming, it may be worth investing in ways to improve the efficiency of this infrastructure among other things for the security of Upcountry folks. There’s also county-wide dependency on unlined reservoirs that collectively leak tens of millions of gallons of water per day and my concern is if there is a prolonged drought, for example, and we do not prepare by requiring reservoirs to be lined or requiring less wasteful infrastructure, these reservoirs could empty themselves during prolonged drought periods and that would leave ag users and others high and dry. I do appreciate the progress that’s been made regarding reuse. After many, many years the Lahaina Wastewater Treatment Plant is finally on its way to recycling some of its wastewater and in that case we not only are reducing the strain on potable water sources by not using them for landscape irrigation and so forth but we’re also reducing the impacts on the nearshore ecosystem. My understanding is the Maui Komohana community, this is a high-level topic of discussion within that community, as well. Finally, along the lines of what Dr. Scheuer was saying, contamination in my mind is tantamount to the waste of what would otherwise be drinkable water. We know, this island in particular, how contamination can create water shortages, sorry my video stopped, even when there’s relative abundance. PFAS or forever chemicals, we’re beginning to really become aware of them and how they effectively last forever and can migrate throughout environment into our water sources over the course of decades or even centuries. While we have currently limited options to deal with the existing contamination of these forever chemicals, what we can do is prevent even further harm by banning them. There are legislative vehicles in the Hawaiʻi Capitol like HB 1896. There’s federal legislation that could be strengthened like the FAA Reauthorization Act. These things could use your support, the Commission’s support or even just your individual support as advocates and experts and stewards of the water resources. Those are just some comments and thoughts, not all these things are controlled by the County, some are in your wheelhouse, some might require legislation, but all in all I’m just very glad for this discussion and hope that we can all work together to address these efficiency needs and protect our water security and our future. Thank you.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Thank you for the opportunity. I am an executive assistant for Council Member Paltin, so I’m speaking on her behalf, I’ll just give you her testimony. She apologizes that she is not able to be here today because she’s appearing before the legislature and she has been deeply engaged on these issues and works tirelessly to craft housing solutions for those impacted by the August 2023 fires. After hearing this item and also thinking ahead to item B2, in particular, it’s incredibly important to Council Member Paltin and the community, which has repeatedly asked to be centered in decision-making that impacts Lahaina especially with respect to the fire recovery, and based on the information that is presented and will be presented it’s unclear whether any more information will be shared for Leialiʻi, in particular. While she’s always supported housing solutions, she’s also concerned that water for the Kāʻanapali project appears to come from the Honokowai Aquifer which is already threatened with over pumping. In wrapping up, Council Member Paltin would like to request to be kept abreast of the water sources for the temporary emergency housing being considered for Kāʻanapali 2020, Leialiʻi and any other potential sites and requests regular updates for what comes of this for each of the temporary emergency sites being considered. Mahalo.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Aloha mai, Kalamaʻehu Takahashi here. Just was mainly here to get more information but just wanted to mahalo CWRM and DWS for organizing these efforts. Sorry, I’m unable to start my video because we have issues with connectivity where we’re reporting in from, so I’m going to respectfully leave my video off for the time being. Certain reservations that I have also with the Kāʻanapali 2020 project are in fact that they are drawing from the Honokowai Aquifer which is an aquifer that has been previously identified as some place that’s been overdrawn at the current time and I think that’s something that we should look to consider. I would also like to just mahalo and echo the sentiments of Dr. Scheuer’s and Dr. Sproat’s comments earlier as well regarding equity and the inclusion of the Lahaina communities in future consultations and these efforts. Particularly as a researcher for our culture research firm, I have serious issues with the lack of cultural historical information that is layered into these sorts of metrics and we’re talking about impacts and what we propose as certain uses. Denying the fact that these areas are in the footprint of the Malu ‘Ulu o Lele and that these are chiefly and also highly populated areas in the cultural historical past is not an excuse for us to be fast tracking these types of projects for the benefit of people that we cannot guarantee are going to be our local community members. I would just ask that we have more inclusion and consultation with the community in regard to the histories of these things and looking forward to more accountability to our private purveyors and users if they refuse to comply with integrating resources with the larger community. And just to keep the community more involved. Sorry, all over the place but here for information. Thank you for your time and willing to answer any questions or anything like that moving forward.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Yes, I have a question for testifier Kalamaʻehu Takahashi and you mentioned your concern over the lack of assessment of impacts and certain uses and as a cultural resource specialist and someone from the area, knowledgeable, if you have thoughts on the metrics that matter. If the metrics we’re using aren’t the right ones, do you have suggestions? You might refer to streamflow, but if you have pointers, if you can articulate them then we can make sure to include them.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Yes, thank you. Off the top of my head I would say that examining traditional water systems prior to the current ones that we are operating within which were illegally built and had a very heavy impact on our cultural resources and the and the socioeconomic parameters and lifestyle and even policies to a certain extent that allows for us to live within a utopian setting where our communities, their families, and future generations for an extended amount of time beyond their own lifetimes would be able to sustain the populations that are living in these areas. For example, I don’t know what the metrics would be but if we were to look at the land use and the irrigation metrics for using the square footage of a golf course or a water feature or a waterfall, how much water that uses as opposed to some other uses such as the regrowth or reforestation of the Malu ‘Ulu o Lele, I think that would help to solve a little more issues. When we’re talking about housing and spacing, feeding our families and just trying to prevent any sort of other climate disasters like the fire from occurring again, I would just like to sum it up by saying that we should examine our cultural past and integrate these systems and integrate that knowledge, use that as the basis for socioeconomic justice and equity that we can use as we try to navigate these spaces towards mitigating the current issues and the issues that we’re going to face as a community in the climate future under these extractive economies. Sorry, again just all over the place, but please let me know if that was an answer to your question. I’m not an expert in all these things like the measurement and certain stuff like that but I do see the value in honoring our stories and our histories and what the landscape was like before the arrival of these foreign interests and these destructive powers. I don’t have an issue with who’s living here and who’s consuming these resources, but it’s just that we collectively need to find ways to [inaudible] these resources. [lost connectivity] We have descendants of the mahiʻai, we have descendants of the konohiki, we have descendants of the aliʻi and stuff like that and that’s the reason why we should look to our communities. They know the best, they have the most stakes, they’ve been here the longest, and I think that they’ll be here much further afterwards. That’s it for now, although I apologize I cannot answer the question clearly at this time. I am also available to be contacted thereafter for further just talk stories or opportunities for us to collaborate in these conversations moving forward.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"I just want to suggest for broader conversation, we have the metrics at the Commission that we use because that’s what the technology enables, but for these tricky problems, maybe thinking more creatively and expansively about metrics that aren’t measured by the Commission but are measured in partnership with community to know that we’re making progress towards the goals we’re going towards. In education we use SATs but we know they’re flawed metrics. So, what are the metrics we should be using because that’s kind of the way our system operates at county and state level. We do need metrics, as flawed as they are, if they get us closer to measuring the things we value then that’s going to lead to better decision making. Please do, as you think about it if there are metrics that the Commission or Maui DWS can consider as they think about conservation and triggers, not just from the public utility, drinking water side but more broadly. I think that will help the Maui water conversations.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"I guess in my mind, tagging on to Aurora’s comment, whether they’re metrics or not, we have Ka Paʻakai analysis that really looks at quantifying impacts through traditional customary practices, but what I hear a lot in all the different conversations we have is just the need for community engagement. Too often communities aren’t part of the process to participate in at least providing information. Our Commission meetings we provide a public forum and I also appreciate Eva. You guys have had several broader community meetings in the different areas to also get input, but I do think we all have to try more deliberately and consistently to engage communities whether they’re in a working group or through community meetings, rather than when a decision needs to be made up. I guess that’s each one of us, each one of the government entities trying to do that in our own relevant way. That’s my own comment.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"Listening to many of the comments, what they’re really asking is for reapportionment of current water uses which I think at least for the Department from Maui, is beyond the scope of what they’re trying to do. I think the onus falls on the Commission to take a look at that. We’ve always just sort of handed out permits as they applied, but the bigger issue is looking at the overall area that we’re giving out permits, how should those be apportioned? Some of the issues that have been brought up was that we have priority areas, we have public trust purposes and they probably don’t match how we just handed out permits as they came up one by one. I don’t want to put this burden on the Department of Water Supply on Maui, otherwise their shortage plan will never move and I think that should be for us to address in some future agenda.",0,B1,02/20/2024
"I think you’re absolutely correct, but it just reemphasizes the need to have water management area designations because that is the vehicle to ensure this much more comprehensive coordinated view.",0,B1,02/20/2024
Approval of Stream Diversion Works Permit Application (SDWP.5951.6) and Special,1,B1,04/18/2023

"Deputy Kaleo Manuel, CWRM Branch",1,B1,04/18/2023
Deputy Manuel read the summary of request as submitted and stated that staff stands on its submittal. Deputy Manuel then read the staff’s recommendations.,1,B1,04/18/2023
"Kaleo, seems like the theme for this meeting. Obviously, our East Maui decision was abandoning a lot of unnecessary diversions, yet we talked about the potential for storage of reservoirs. So, did any analysis go into it? Is this a potential reservoir or dam that could offer opportunities to store excess water? And if not, as you know there is a Senate Bill 1066 that the commission might be setting up a priority list of capital Improvement projects that could include restoration of the dams and reservoirs. So, the question is, was any analysis done on this reservoir? I know you read the news today and the land board is looking at a decision on Kalihiwai on Kaua‘i. It's just important that we kind of go through that thought process before we close down these reservoirs. Is this an important reservoir, whose partner? What would it take to restore it? Does it offer us opportunity? so that’s much of a comment. But I'm just curious about this one. Was any analysis done in that regard?",1,B1,04/18/2023
"Mahalo Commissioner Buck. I will start the response and then we do have the applicants here and they may be able to address directly more of your comment about analysis of use etc., So, specifically to the Water Commission, that level of analysis of use of reservoirs for storage etc. in this context isn't something that we've looked at. Right now, this is just a stream diversion works permit as it relates to dam safety. Dam safety is working with the applicant to review it. I don't know as a state as a whole who is ultimately responsible for driving this analysis. Is it department of AG? Is it State Engineering? In DLNR, right now the Water Commission isn’t doing that level analysis. Something that we could look at and into but that's not currently what we're looking at. Right now, it’s purely from the regulatory perspective that we're looking at it. It could become more of a component, for example, of the State Water Projects Plan. And just to note, this is a private dam. Right now, private property so to an extent the state works with private parties to help support them and analyze that. But we've never really done that analysis on non-governmental plans to look at this approach comprehensively.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"Aloha Chairperson Chang and fellow Commissioners and Deputy Manuel. Mahalo for having us. In early 2000, we did an internal analysis of this dam. Not just historical, but in a time that I've worked here in my 25 years. We're looking at the amount of time that reservoir actually held water. When we were in sugar, we've been farming all these years and at that time even on a conservative basis we were looking at like 20 percent of the time. Now with climate change, as we had that excellent presentation done earlier, you know climate change is a whole other different animal. The changes in the atmosphere and in the area. I've seen over my 25-year career, we will be taking even less amounts of water in the reservoir and speaking briefly with dam safety over the years. I've been working with them closely for many years and you know we've been talking about this remediation of this magnitude would be anywhere from possibly from 12 to 15 million dollars and for something like that to hold water 15 percent of the year. Water is important but for 15 percent of the year that's just a tough pill to swallow for anyone. Is it an important reservoir? It is, but we've been able to function without it since 2007. We haven't operated it since 2007 and then you add the IIFS that's coming in. That's just even less water that's available for the reservoir so, we just felt that this was the time, plus there are safety hazards in there that could potentially get worse so we felt like this was the time to address this and so we came up with our own internal analysis. Commissioner Buck: Mark, I appreciate that. I think we totally understand that a lot of the private dams and reservoirs are a liability right now from private landowners. I think we are pushing the legislature to understand that, and it has to be a modicum of public funding in partnership with private landowners, to at least preserve the important reservoirs that offer a whole multitude of benefits. So, I hope in your analysis, and I totally appreciate it from your perspective, that you keep that in mind, and you can share with us some of the factors. What would it take on the public side to help you preserve this might not be the reservoir that we're talking about, but I think in the future there will be public funds available to try to partner with private landowners to be able to restore and bring these reservoirs and dams back up to a level because if they don't produce a lot of public benefits, in addition to potential water storage during dry times and to capture episodic rain event. So, I just appreciate, because I know you do have a lot of dams and reservoirs in your portfolio, that if you can provide us that kind of context that will help, at least the public policy makers to identify the public benefits involved and the types of contributions from the public side that would work in partnership with you to keep some of these dams’ reservoirs in place. Thank you.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"thank you for your comment’s, Commissioner Buck. We've taken all of that into consideration and we are working on remediation projects for other dams and reservoirs that we feel would be more strategic and more beneficial, not just for the farm because these are all just farm reservoirs, they don't supply anything to the public. But we're talking about making improvements to other dams and reservoirs that are going to be more strategically important for us.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"well, I would check out Senate Bill 1066. And it does ask the Commission for next year to come up with a priority list of capital improvement projects that include both public and private contributions. So hopefully we can use your data to come up and help move up some of the list of these priority reservoirs. Thank you.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"thank you, Deputy Manuel for presenting that. I guess I’m mostly responding to some written testimony received and will probably hear about it later, not about the agricultural use for climate change but the other end of it. I first read stream diversion and then I read dam. Those sort of confer different levels of hazard and risk to downstream communities. I wanted to better understand what the status of the engineering review is, and any potential dialogue was SPHD since the submittal was posted. Archaeological features might not be on site, but they might be affected by changes in the flow regimes especially during high rainfall events.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"I’ll start and see if we can address some of these questions. Again, so related to what's before you are what we have authority over. The stream diversion, in this case in the stream, the dam itself is what is diverting water. That’s just a design and how it was developed. So, one of the permits that we require stream diversion works abandonment. If you're going to formally abandon a diversion in this case, because it's also a dam, they have to comply with safety standards and their application and review process. So, what we're trying to do is make sure that on our books the diversion is taken off. It's no longer a diversion, something that's allowing the applicant to divert water. But on the dam safety side how that's designed, how it manages the water flooding etc. that application is still in process based on what we understand. There's still going to be a process that DLNR and dam safety is going to look at in terms of managing potential downstream impacts. We also submitted this to SHPD but haven't received a response yet. If SHPD does come back to the commission with recommended preservation or archaeological inventory, then we would add that as conditions to this permit. And if the applicant is not happy with that then we come back to the Commission basically and say here's the situation this is what SHPD’s recommending we're saying to add it as a condition. But the applicant may have concerns or not want to address that. Those are things that we can address as part of this process. Right now, we're taking our piece of the pie in this larger decommissioning effort to make sure we're meeting our compliance requirements. So that’s my simple response to where we're at.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"so, does engineering division have regulatory oversight?",1,B1,04/18/2023
they have regulatory oversight over the dam and how it's designed for decommissioning. They issue permits and manage it and fine and have regulatory oversight. The Board of Land and Natural Resources manages that process.,1,B1,04/18/2023
"So, they have a separate approval if they agree that removing the dam itself, not just permitting the dam but removal meets their requirements. I'm just worried that if we approve something then we take on the liability in case it becomes a hazard. So, we're seeing these as parenthesis.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"that’s the way I understand it. I apologize that dam safety is not here or engineering is not here and maybe I can ask Ryan to run down the hallway and see if we can get somebody from engineering to jump on. That would be great. They reviewed the application, and their comments were, we are working with the applicant on their dam removal application and will be coordinating that. And so again the applicant is here and is going through all of the regulatory requirements in order to be compliant with the work that they're proposing. I don't know if Mark has any additional information to share based on their conversation with dam safety. But, from our perspective, we're coordinating on the Water Commission side and dam safety will be reviewing it on the Land Board side which is purely within their authority and regulatory review.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"we've been working with dam safety for quite a while on the removal of this and meeting all of their requirements and their criteria. Design criteria, restoration criteria, all of that. As Kaleo mentioned, we are in SHPD review. They are reviewing this currently and I know that Pilale bay, a lot of the archaeological sites there are awesome. And they've definitely been inventoried. I’m sure that SHPD would have something to add about that.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"Aurora, do you have anything else you want to add to that? Can I just tag on following up with that comment Mark. Under the engineering and the abandonment on the dam safety side. What is going to be physically done? I’m thinking of environmental impacts. Because the Water Commission is saying there is no EA trigger but I’m wondering, is there a trigger at the dam safety site?",1,B1,04/18/2023
"dam safety gives us the requirements to complete removal of the embankment, and they do flow dynamic studies to decide the width of the breach in the actual removal so we have to take out the entire embankment that has to be removed off-site and then all of the sedimentation has to be protected and the stream bed has to be protected with thousands of yards of rip rap just large boulders and rocks that are placed along the bottom to keep the sediment from flowing out. There's embankment restoration on either side of the stream banks that has to take place so that we minimize any downstream impacts along the way. It's a whole transformation of as best as possible restoring everything to what it was prior to this dam being built in 1885. That’s the goal of dam safety and the restoration of ecology, and the rest of the entire waterway being restored to pre- contact or pre-erection of the dam itself.",1,B1,04/18/2023
do you know whether they're going to require an environmental assessment to be completed?,1,B1,04/18/2023
"I don't know. I don't believe so. I'm not sure we went through this before with them Kaupakalua dam and that wasn't required for that. But again, we were given a list of the requirements, and I didn't see that on the requirements. That may be a question for dam safety.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"we'll check with them prior to coming to the board because I'm just thinking that's a lot of restoration of the embankment. You are moving a lot of potential dirt, soil and putting rocks there might be some impact so. That might be a more relevant question to the engineering department than to CWRM because before us, is only the abandonment of the stream diversion.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"So, in this case there’s overlap where the thing that is diverting water is the dam. It functions as that and most diversions do too, but sometimes we just have a pipe or a pump that’s located in the stream. In this case what we are primarily doing, and this is ultimately tied to follow- ups of abandonment of diversions following irrigation throughout the decision in order, is working with East Maui to get through this to take the kuleana off. Knowing that once this is done, we don't have to regulate them as a diverter, and they are no longer required to report to us and meet all those compliance requirements, kind of cleans up the books. But this is part of that formal process.",1,B1,04/18/2023
I appreciate that clarification. And I appreciate the good work that you guys are doing Mark. I guess sometimes when there's overlapping jurisdiction you don't want something to fall through the cracks right. Okay.,1,B1,04/18/2023
is Dr. Ayron Strauch or if someone from stream protection and management division is present. She is concerned about the downstream implications of removing a reservoir in the context of climate change. She believes that the engineering division may have more information on how these changes will flow. She also expresses worry that restoring the area to pre- dam period may not be feasible due to changes in the stream dynamics caused by climate change. She asks for clarification on the stream dynamics and their implications.,1,B1,04/18/2023
"the dam in question is an in-stream dam that captures high flow events in the stream. The frequency of these events is changing due to climate change. Peak flow estimates are based on a long-term record and not projected future events. The peak flow for a two-year flood event is roughly 300 million gallons per day, while the dam’s capacity is only 100 million gallons. Currently, the peak flow would overtop the existing structure every other year. Removing the dam would not affect the regularity with which high flow events pass through.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"so that's the periodicity. You don't have this 100-million-gallon buffer, so you actually are going to increase, maybe the frequency of like if you're downstream, you're going to increase the frequency at which we see these bumps and I guess I just want a better understanding.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"there are still upstream diversions in the watershed that capture lower flow events. However, even with the dam in place, the two-year storm event was still overtopping the existing infrastructure, meaning that removing the dam would not significantly impact the frequency of high flow events downstream, but may have a small impact on their magnitude.",1,B1,04/18/2023
okay that was my question. I'll pass it to Wayne. I'm processing.,1,B1,04/18/2023
"looking at the requirements of other diverters. How does it affect them during the low flow? Because now you have no release even if you had 100-million-gallon storage that somehow was controlled, you have no control now so, how does that impact those diversions and those users?",1,B1,04/18/2023
"what I understand about the watershed is that the diversions downstream are owned or operated by East Maui Irrigation. How they manage their system, whether they release water from the reservoir or not, would only be impacting themselves. Is that what you're asking? What is the implication for downstream users? I don’t see it being consequential.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"so, during peak flows. The attenuation of the flows, how does it affect downstream users or facilities at the stream mouth for example?",1,B1,04/18/2023
"downstream landowners are primarily EMI themselves. The larger flood events: the one in 10-year flood that is now occurring more regularly, as you might be expecting with climate change. It was 1300 CFS so approximately 900 million gallons per day. That dam is going to have no impact on that flow event, and we don't predict that the removal of the dam is going to substantially affect the magnitude or the frequency of the high flow major flooding events.",1,B1,04/18/2023
EMI manages low flow events so that's not an issue. The engineering division is going to go through all this analysis as well.,1,B1,04/18/2023
"Of course, the engineering division is going to go through all this analysis.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"okay, good. Thank you.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"thank you very much. This dam presumably was built for a good reason because it was necessary either to slow down large rainfall events and flooding. But secondly, I would think it was built as a storage device for irrigation of farmland. Whether it's HC&S or other users somebody spent a fair amount of money to build it in the first place. Is that need prospectively non- existent today? In other words, is there no reason for that additional storage? Is it something that is really unnecessary prospectively for the future as a storage device?",1,B1,04/18/2023
"we took all that into account. This was back in the early 2000s when we did our own internal review and that was with sugarcane and the projection came and Mahi pono took over. Now we're looking at storage which the plan is to use half of the water that we used back when we were in sugar. And that's currently what we're doing. Because that reservoir doesn't hold 100 million gallons. My records indicate 52 million gallons and that was prior. I have only been here over 25 years and we haven’t dredged it or tried to remove anything so that has settled in. So, there's probably even less storage in it now. It’s expensive to rebuild. They're also very expensive to bring into compliance, maintain and operate. Then you carry the liability that goes along with that. Now we're talking about climate change where water is even less. So is it worth expanding that amount of money to preserve something that's even less and it just becomes more and more difficult to manage, it's a question of economics as far as maintaining or bringing the dam into compliance. Remediating all the things that we need to remediate. It just ended up being that unfortunately it's not going to be as beneficial to us as we would have liked it.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"hypothetical question, if there were a government agency responsible for managing distribution of water resources would it make any sense to have a governmental agency take over the responsibility of this dam and to manage it for the community interest in the long run? One of the things that's poignant in my memory was the sort of devolution disrepair of the West Maui ditch. That was largely made unfeasible in terms of operation by virtue of the decommissioning of reservoirs along the way.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"I cannot speak about the history of the West Maui system. The current location of Kapala‘alaea dam where it is located and the ditch that it does supply, that water is only farm water. It doesn't service the community in any other way, but just brings water across to irrigate crops. I think that has the smallest watershed of all of them.",1,B1,04/18/2023
thank you for answering those difficult questions and sharing your wisdom in that respect. EMI’s position with respect to the decommissioning on that and there are good reasons for it from your perspective.,1,B1,04/18/2023
Chairperson of the Sierra Club Maui Group. The streams affected by the dam are not part of the East Maui decision and are not regulated by IIFS. The land where the dam is located is no longer owned by EMI but by Kamehameha schools for conservation and restoration. She raises concerns about the impact of high storm events on traditional Hawaiian practices and infrastructure. She suggests involving the ‘Aha Moku Council and conducting an inventory of the area around the dam.,1,B1,04/18/2023
Consultant for East Maui Irrigation. He clarified that an environmental assessment is not required for the project since Nationwide permits number 3 and 13 will be applicable. An endangered species Section 7 consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service is required and has been completed. They are waiting for Nationwide permits from the Corps of Engineers for Section 404 and section 401 blanket coverage from the Department of Health.,1,B1,04/18/2023
"She is the ‘Aha Moku representative for Hamakualoa and has some concerns about the proposed project. She was not able to listen to everything, but also did not find any communication in her emails about the project. She has reservations about the way the project is being approached and wants to learn more about the history and intent behind the dam or diversion that was put in place in 1885. She believes there needs to be more consideration given to the cultural significance of the area and wants to reach out to kuleanas in the area to gather more information. She is also concerned about the lack of response from Departments that were contacted about the project and asks for more time before making a decision.",1,B1,04/18/2023
regarding local consultation with ‘Aha Moku Council as well as immediate residence. Is it possible to add them as a layer in concurrence to SHPD recommendation since its subject to?,1,B1,04/18/2023
"based on the conversation and having to wait for SHPD and because this is also tied to a jurisdiction of DLNR, I'm comfortable in terms of timeline differing a month or two to do specific outreach. The recommendations: - Kamehameha schools, if they are a downstream landowner, if they have any comments on the application. - Department of Transportation based on Sierra club's comments about whether the drainage in the road is sufficient to handle additional flows. I’m comfortable with taking a quick pause but would like to check in with Mark if there are any critical timeframes.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"I want to address the Department of Trans in terms of consultation. We ran the required design flows that they asked us to run through that watershed and they responded that it was okay to move ahead. The culvert that we do have in place on the highway is sufficient to take the design plot that they gave us. As far as delaying, we are sitting on SHPD, and it can be a lengthy review as they turn over all stones, but it's good because they do you know they do turn over all the stones.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"I want to address a kind of procedural issue. In my view from the Commission standpoint, we have the Constitutional obligation Article 12 Section 7. Based on the information that's presented to us, I do not believe that that is kuleana of our staff. In my mind that is the kuleana of the applicant to provide sufficient information to make that analysis. I am proposing that Mahi Pono, the applicant, talk stories with Joyclynn to address some of her concerns as part of your application to us.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"ultimately if our goal is to decommission this dam and it's going to affect downstream, something that Joyclynn feels strongly about, then yes of course.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"Mahalo. I really appreciate that. The burden is on the applicant and then the commission applies the information provided. If we don't have enough information, then we shouldn't take action. Makes sense commissioners?",1,B1,04/18/2023
That sounds like a deferral. The other option that I thought is to say we approve it if you get the concurrence of SHPD and if you want to add ‘Aha Moku we could condition it. That way we don't need to see it or touch it again if the concurrence is there.,1,B1,04/18/2023
"I don't want to delegate Ka Pa‘akai to SHPD. My preference would be, that Mark, you tell us when you're ready to come back. This reservoir has been abandoned for quite some time. It will give you guys time to talk story. That is more appropriate that we have the landowner talking story with these families who have a connection. I don't think we should be accepting that responsibility on behalf of the applicant.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"I think that's really important to have that dialogue. But then in the future there might be settings where an applicant has a vested interest in maybe taking a selection of that information. There might be certain powered dynamics and local dynamics where I think the commission staff, I want to look to the commission staff to say, is this a good Ka Pa‘akai analysis? Is it complete? Are we doing more than just citing an oral history but speaking to the living practicing practitioners here today. I don't want to supersede the staff's role in this because they have so much experience with multiple applications, but I agree with you like we don't want to prevent direct communication.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"I appreciate that. In my mind from a legal standpoint staff can do the assessment based upon the information provided. So, if there is not enough information, they should let us know that or we can make that assessment or like these public meetings I really appreciated Jocelynn’s comments. A public platform provides the opportunity for the community to tell us you don’t have enough information and then we can make the assessment to defer. I don't have a problem legally saying I cannot fulfill my constitutional obligation therefore I'm going to have to deny the application. I hope we don't have to do that, but again I don't want to place that burden on our staff. Because then that shifts in my mind, a legal burden from the applicant to CWRM staff to do.",1,B1,04/18/2023
"I have no problem with the deferral especially since we're dealing with an applicant who's really trying to do the right thing. But I think we owe it as we try to get better relationships with restoration of dams and reservoirs. We have three different divisions in our department that are involved, and we need to kind of coalescing and get more organized so we can communicate to the landowners either restoring or removing dams that the department can have a much more coordinated approach, rather than having them step through all three different division approvals.",1,B1,04/18/2023
that's a good point. As the chairperson you're right I mean we should be facilitating that coordinated effort rather than having landowners go through so many different hoops. There should be much better coordination. We will work on that.,1,B1,04/18/2023

"Dean, you are there. You were around.",0,C5,11/21/2023
"I am here, been listening. The original hydrologic units were developed based on initially a 1990 Hawaii Stream Assessment Report that was created which just looked at the streams. We needed a way to code each of these areas that we're looking at and so I think in 1994 soon after that, the State developed watershed boundaries. These weren't so much for modeling purposes, was more just for a coding system. Between our data sets like Aquatic Resources and Office of Planning and us, we could have a common system that we would use and reference. Royce Jones who was one of the leading GIS folks in the state had developed these watershed boundaries that was further refined by NRCS and Pat Shade who used to work with NRCS and both US Geological Survey. Then we took those and again ours aren't intended for modeling, it's more for creating a system that we could identify an area and code. There are some areas in the State that are not as refined or need to be looked at more closely. As we do our work across the state we come across these areas and we may be fixing them as needed as Ayron is doing here. We actually have a full short report that outlines the whole process if you're interested.",0,C5,11/21/2023
"Aloha, yes. Tara Rojas. I have a question and you know that's great for hearing this information but my question to you is last year, 2022, one of the water meetings. It was mentioned and it was like in tiny, tiny, tiny little letters on the minutes on the report that 3 million gallons will be lost per month. That it was unknown where and it had been going on for a long time, if not years. Is that still going on? Have you ever found the source of that 3 million gallon leak? That's my first question. My second question is as noticed the properties and everything up for sale, are you guys aware of just the overdevelopment and the issues currently going on and having the water there for future generations?",0,C5,11/21/2023
"Tara, are you asking about Item C5?",0,C5,11/21/2023
Do you have a specific location where you say the 3 million gallons?,0,C5,11/21/2023
"No, it's been a long time but, I remember it was a 3-million-gallon leak that they said and I came and I testified and I asked questions and they said they didn't know where it was coming from and that it was very difficult to detect because apparently some of the places would run onto private property. That was an issue. Another thing was they said if the leak is happening in an area where there's sand and with sand you cannot see the leak, the water bubbling up or where there's a leak as well as on dirt. They were saying that and I went back and I asked but it's been going on for years so they hadn't found the source of the leak and that's three million gallons per month for years and upon years. Is it still happening?",0,C5,11/21/2023

"Aloha nō. I just wanted to make one comment and that was to do with the Koloa parcel that was, I think it's now the Kauanoe o Kauaʻi new development. I do want to make a comment that in the EIS there were seven pūnāwai there that were capped off and I, me again Kiara Lorenzo Rodriguez for the record, as a wahine maoli it’s very important for us to ensure that we have this pūnāwai in case anything happens. If Covid has taught us anything it is that we need to be ready in times of need to be able to produce and harvest food for our people. These are concerns that have come across the board not only in the Kōloa ahupuaʻa but in all of Kauaʻi. So just keeping in consideration that we will do well not to waste this precious wai a Kāne, especially in one of what is to be said one of our most wet mokupuni, our most eldest.

"I have been asked to present current information for the AFFF incident. On November 29, 2022, at about 12:30 pm/1:00 pm the Navy reported that a worker discovered an AFFF release. At about 2:38 pm the Navy notified DOH that approximately 1,100 gallons of an aqueous film forming foam concentrate was released in the tunnel and it impacted areas such as Adit 6 itself, it went out of Adit 6 onto the asphalt and down the soil area and a culvert. My coworker and I went to the scene at approximately 3:30 pm and what we had discussed with the Navy on scene coordinator that was present on site, was to make sure that they delineated the spill and immediately remove the AFFF impacted media. We requested for EPA’s technical assistance. DOH also requested a response action plan and a written sampling plan for soil and groundwater knowing the importance and gravity of the AFFF that was released. DOH has been overseeing the cleanup action and the cleanup response that has been going on at Red Hill and DOH did receive the emergency response sampling plan for soil and groundwater on November 30th. The Navy and DOH along with EPA’s assistance came to an agreement with the sampling plan for soil and groundwater. DOH also requested for a waste management and disposal plan. DOH wanted to ensure that the waste was handled properly, and the disposal can be tracked from cradle-to-grave. In addition, we wanted to make sure that there is a decontamination plan for Adit 6. The Department of Health issued a notice of interest requesting for those things and additionally wanted to make sure that they provide us with other AFFF releases that had happened in the past to ensure that the cleanup is done properly. As part of our mandate, the Department also expected to receive from the Navy a 30-day written follow-up which DOH received. The first part of the cleanup was to do exterior excavation. The initial excavation is complete and they had collected approximately 150 cubic yards and that is currently stored off- site awaiting analytical results of how to and where to dispose of it. On December 14, we had approved a temporary cap of asphalt to prevent potential contamination from spreading and this action reduces the risk to public health and the environment. As the operations were ongoing 24/7 we were there and we could clearly observe the rains would collect in plastic covered excavated areas, so upon further discussion with the Navy it was best that they temporarily cap it knowing that depending upon the sampling results, that more work needs to be done and they are prepared to do the excavation. Sampling has also been done for soil and groundwater, sampling for groundwater wells continues to be done weekly. For the wells, we are awaiting validated data and results will be discussed with the EPA and the Navy. Are there any questions? Thank you.",0,C1,01/24/2023

Have they met DOH expectations?,0,C1,01/24/2023
"It had undergone reiterations and with emergency response plans those plans change depending on the situation. The latest one that is posted is the current one.

"For the past 30 years one of my job tasks is to compile toxicity information for different compounds working with toxicologists to develop action levels as we call them for different compounds and drinking water. The EPA has posted drinking water screening levels for three, or four maybe five PFAS by now. We’ve been doing other studies around Hawai‘i and we know we need a lot more than that so I’ve been talking with multiple states around the U.S., compiling information they have as well as the EPA and we have drinking water action levels now for 19 almost 20 of these compounds and we’re still working with other agencies to continue compiling data. It mostly reflects information the EPA has published but again that is limited so we’re working with other states giving presentations to multiple states plus EPA headquarters on what we’re doing.

"I am going to give a brief summary of work being done under our Emergency Order that was finalized on May 6, 2022. It requires the Navy to close and defuel the facility as quickly and safely as possible. In November 2022, the Navy with our oversight was able to unpack one million gallons of fuel from the facility pipelines without incident. Now that the facility is unpacked, the Navy can begin doing repairs. On November 1st they gave us a list of 253 repairs that were recommended before safety defueling can occur. We are working with them to shorten that list to expedite the defueling timeline so repairs that are redundant or represent a low risk if they do not occur, we are giving the Navy permission to remove those repairs. For example, two weeks ago we approved a deviation from the repairs list that the Navy tells us may shorten the defueling timeline by three months. That’s the sort of thing we’re going for. Now I’ll talk about the closure side. On November 1st as well, we received the Navy’s closure plan. We found it a little lacking in detail, so we provided a list of 86 questions to them, and we are awaiting their response and we have not yet approved the closure plan.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"As you probably all know, the Navy and EPA are about to enter an Administrative Order on Consent. The EPA was required to come out for public hearing which took place on Wednesday and Thursday, the DOH participated in a science fair project to talk about all these things that are going on at Red Hill. The big question that came up to us is why isn’t the DOH a party to the EPA and the Navy’s Administrative Order on Consent? That really is because the Department of Health feels very strongly that its administrative order is protecting the public health and the environment, and we want to ensure that we don’t yield any of our regulatory authority to anyone and keep it within the state. Does anybody have any questions on the Emergency Order or the AOC emergency order interface?",0,C1,01/24/2023
I haven’t tracked this as much recently so this is a different Administrative Order on Consent?,0,C1,01/24/2023
That’s correct. There was a 2015 Administrative Order on Consent that the EPA just entered and is doing a 2023 Administrative Order on Consent [Administrative Consent Order]. It’s online and they are taking public comment until February 6.,0,C1,01/24/2023
What does this mean for the regular voting public?,0,C1,01/24/2023
The DOH had its Emergency Order and EPA did not have something similar so this Administrative Order on Consent [Consent Order] allows them to regulate the defueling/decommissioning aspect of it. There are other aspects of it that you should read if you are very much interested but that’s the gist of it.,0,C1,01/24/2023
"This is not a question, Chair this is for your radar screen. Last administration formed a Permitted Interaction Group which strongly recommended that we use further regulatory authority of the Water Commission specifically to modify their water permits to assure that long term recovery would happen. That motion was unanimously approved by the full Commission, there was some resistance to implement that at the end of this last administration and I think some of this may be better discussed in executive session which I’m not recommending now but Deputy Manuel is totally aware of the issue and can brief you. I think we want to give you some time to absorb the full breadth of the Red Hill situation but that is because it was unanimously approved by the Water Commission that’s an issue that we would like to discuss with you and in cooperation with the Department of Health sometime for future Water Commission meetings. Thank you.",0,C1,01/24/2023

"The water testing to date indicate compliance with the long-term monitoring. Exceedances has predominantly been lead found in fixtures such as premise plumbing. [Mediation]Remediation response include replacement of the fixture or to take the fixture out of service. Periods 1 to 3 starting April 2023 sampled 5% of homes and buildings for each monthly period. Approximately 1,630 buildings and home locations were sampled in the first three periods adding to the already 1,000+ building and homes sampled in stage 4. Stage 5 is the long- term monitoring plan. Period 4 was completed in November 2022, approximately 1,122 buildings and home locations were sampled, and we are now in period 5 which is slated to end in May 2023 with another 1,122 buildings and homes.

The Navy’s Aiea Halawa shaft is currently not in use and the joint base Pearl Harbor and the consecutive system Aliamanu military reservation is being served by a single source in Waiawa. Ms. Seto introduced Fenix Grange, Hazard Evaluation Emergency Response Office.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I have been leading the environmental team, evaluating the groundwater, and doing our best to understand what’s happening in the subsurface with the previous spills and looking ahead to ensure that the Navy has done the work necessary to be ready should a spill happen. During defueling there are many efforts being overseen by our engineering folks as well as to ensure that the likelihood over these is low but nonetheless it is very important, we understand where fuel might go should that happen so that we can be prepared and protect our groundwater sources. We do that in a few ways in terms of directing the Navy to put in additional sentinel wells so that we have early warning systems to protect the Board of Water Supply wells as well as other water sources. The way the data that we [collet]collect is regular monitoring, groundwater monitoring, so they put monitoring on a very frequent basis and then we have our subject matter expert study those to understand what kinds of patterns we are seeing. The other thing that has been the responsibility of the Navy was to complete a groundwater flow model to be able to understand how the water is moving, what direction it is moving and so that helps us understand how contaminants are transported. We also require contaminant fate and transport, that’s generally how fluid spilled on the ground, into the ground, moves above the water table, but underground. With the lava flows here, fuels can get trapped in pockets in some places, but they can flow rapidly through cracks and other sorts of things like that, so we are working hard to try to understand what is happening there. The groundwater modeling efforts the Navy have done to date, we have not found satisfactory in terms of their ability to represent well data that we collect, changes in temperature, chemistry of the water and sorts of things like that so we continue to work with them on that, for now we are also very focused on additional efforts including field studies. The University of Hawai‘i received a grant from the Office of Naval Research with Don Thomas as the principal investigator so he has independent federal funding to be able to further investigate and help us with modeling. We do have a lot of data coming in and one of the questions from one of the constituents, Katherine McCallahan, she had a list of questions and to save time today I’m not going to go over them one by one, but I have them ready to send to her and I’d be happy to send them to the Commission as well. It really has to do with understanding what the long sheets of data that come from the Department that are posted on the DOH website and what they mean, etc.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I just want to confirm, are you going to be able to make that data available to the Water Commission?",0,C1,01/24/2023
"The results are available on our DOH website and it’s a cumulative summary of all the data collected under our EO, May and November 2021 releases. Katherine had specific questions why there appear to be data gaps in certain areas and why sometimes the data didn’t get posted especially right after the May release samples were collected starting in May. We were not able to get our hands on the data until late in the summer and some of the data in June and July, we didn’t get until late September, so we were not able to post those in time. Again, there’s a lot of detail here and I’m happy to send both the data sheet and this information together, that might be the easiest way to understand what we are talking about, what the questions are and what our answers are.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"Thanks, Fenix for the update. My understanding was that at a time when you were waiting for the Navy to hand over data and there were lags, so now DOH is taking independent sampling? Is that correct? Categorizing them separately?",0,C1,01/24/2023
"We don’t do that consistently but yes, we do. We did quite a bit of that after the November release and in December and January. That also involves our field staff, observing, collecting samples, etc. Similarly, with the AFFF spill that happened recently our folks were out there watching and collecting samples as well.",0,C1,01/24/2023
Are those data back from the lab? Are they posted on the DOH website and is it in the same place? From what I remember it was sometimes hard to navigate what information was where.,0,C1,01/24/2023
We have an agreement with the Navy to produce that data so it should be posted on Friday of this week for the PFAS release and that includes data from the soil and groundwater wells.,0,C1,01/24/2023
"Aurora, there’s a recognition on my behalf, our website can be difficult or unfriendly, so we are actively working on trying to make it easier to navigate.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I think I noticed that it was more organized for public access so it’s good to know it will all be accessible through that website, thank you.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"Just one more note, the AFFF the laboratory they are using for the PFAS has been what we understood from talking with the Navy is it’s taking time for those data to come back as well. They have most of the first week’s data so the goal for Friday is to be able post all of the first two weeks of data that were collected. Those are the most significant, the ones they were trying to categorize or figure out where the edges of contamination were, etc.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I’m kind of the new kid on the block, is DOH the repository of data? Do you collect BWS data as well?",0,C1,01/24/2023
"The BWS data belongs to them. We would certainly be delighted to have it and I think there is interest on all parties to be able to share data so we can all see what’s going on. We have acted as a repository of the Navy’s data and of our data and the Navy has it online as well. They are currently expanding their safe water site that was originally for the drinking water for neighborhoods that were affected by the spill, but they now have an environmental data section online. It is in its beginning stages but that is there as well and as Kathy mentioned we’re looking to figure out how to make access to the information and the way the information is presented in a more user-friendly way, so you don’t end up having to go through lots of different documents or search through large excel files. We are still working on that, and the Navy is doing that as well.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"Essentially, you don’t have BWS data?",0,C1,01/24/2023
We do not have BWS data. We have spoken about that with them and still hope that we can get it. Every piece of data that we have about what is happening in different parts of the region especially around their wells helps model and understand what might be happening in that area and they are also similarly interested in our data.,0,C1,01/24/2023
Thank you very much.,0,C1,01/24/2023
Given this new potential AOC what does DOH feel is an optimistic timeline for defueling since you folks have been on this for a long time?,0,C1,01/24/2023
"We recognize that fuel in the tanks can lead to a catastrophe, but there is also a recognition that if we defuel too quickly without critical repairs to the pipeline, it could lead to a similar catastrophe. We are trying to balance the two. We do believe the repairs to the pipeline are critical as we defuel and we’re hoping that the repairs to the pipeline will be done sometime in early 2024 and defueling subsequently.",0,C1,01/24/2023
Completed in early 2024?,0,C1,01/24/2023
DOH and EPA are looking at any possible way that we can shorten that timeline.,0,C1,01/24/2023
"Absolutely, we don’t want another catastrophe.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani, we have the Navy’s latest defueling schedule as a link on our website so you can find that there. We also have a condensed timeline version that the department has compiled that was shared at our open house last week Thursday.",0,C1,01/24/2023
Would you mind screen sharing just for those watching and the public so they know that we should all go check out the website?,0,C1,01/24/2023
"This is our DOH website for the Red Hill Water Information (https://health.hawaii.gov/about/red-hill-water-information/) you would go to the EO and the condensed timeline would be at this location here. This is the summary of the defueling timeline where we have the Navy’s estimate of repairs to be completed by November 7, 2023, and defueling estimated to be completed by June 24, 2024.",0,C1,01/24/2023
That’s helpful thank you for giving us a brief tour of the site.,0,C1,01/24/2023
"I’m not sure if this is for Joanna or Kathy, this is forward looking as you’ve gone through the Red Hill experience you have a 900-pound gorilla sitting on top of a 1,800-pound valuable resource and from the cheap seats at 60,000 feet, it seems like the institutional knowledge of the operators of that 900-pound gorilla weren’t very good. Looking forward, can you recommend things that the Commission can look at to be more proactive rather than reactive to these situations? I recognize DOH has a certain responsibility for safe drinking water and EPA has a certain responsibility for water quality, but it seems that the Navy’s institutional knowledge and coping with the potential hazard of the fuel has been suspect in my mind where they keep turning wrong valves or getting contractors who are directed to do work.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"That’s a good question, operationally the Navy has demonstrated they were not able to operate that facility safely which led to our first Emergency Order, which is why we issued that first Emergency Order. We are committed to overseeing the defueling in addition to the repairs. There are going to be drills on the defueling itself and there is going to be monitoring both by EPA, DOH and independent contractors as they defuel. Hopefully it will go as it did with the unpacking which we went through similar drills. They didn’t release any fuel at that time, and they unpacked approximately one (1) million gallons of fuel out of those pipelines and so I think if we continue to be vigilant and make them go through the steps and monitor, hopefully we can successfully defuel these tanks.",0,C1,01/24/2023
Are you recommending organizational changes to develop institutional knowledge so they can be proactive in managing the current water systems that they have responsibility for?,0,C1,01/24/2023
That’s a separate question so you’re talking about the use of their water and managing their water system.,0,C1,01/24/2023
"With all the different hazards that they have, being in the military, that’s what you deal with.",0,C1,01/24/2023
I think that can be best answered by Dennis who is the Manager of the Safe Drinking Water Branch.,0,C1,01/24/2023
Are there any other situations like that where you have maybe a 400- pound gorilla sitting on a 400-pound water resource?,0,C1,01/24/2023
"Generally speaking, the DOH regulates the water system provider. We would regulate BWS or the Navy, it’s up to the purveyor of that water to provide safe drinking water to its customers. The other thing is, currently the Navy is not getting its water from Red Hill shaft. They’re getting it from Waiawa Shaft which is the same shaft that we are all getting our water from. First, we need to remediate the aquifer before we can come to that determination on how they are going to regulate that water to their users, if anybody…Joanna or Dennis if you want to chime in?",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I’m looking more to be in proactive mode, I don’t want to be in reactive mode.",0,C1,01/24/2023
I understand that and maybe that’s a discussion we can have as a Commission.,0,C1,01/24/2023
"I think that’s the value of what we provide as CWRM, you have your job and I understand and thank goodness for that, thanks, Kathy.",0,C1,01/24/2023
I wasn’t sure if there was a response from Dennis?,0,C1,01/24/2023
"I thought I was being asked to comment, I can still comment if Commissioner Katayama wants me to, if he can rephrase the question for me.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I just wondered from the lessons learned, as you’re going through this Red Hill situation, rather than being reactive to situations, what can we do to be more proactive in assuring ourselves whoever the purveyor is, has institutional knowledge to anticipate before a situation gets out of hand, where it endangers our water systems, what can we do?",0,C1,01/24/2023
"When we did assist the EPA with the water system portion of the AOC proposed 2023 EPA Consent Order, we worked it with them to put together a plan to increase their capability to respond to clear the drinking water system. A couple of items that we had them put in is to have a hydraulic model which the water distribution system was lacking. During the response time it prohibited flushing techniques that they couldn’t do. Other items that we wanted them to make sure that the Navy had as part of their response is a valve maintenance program. Some of the excuses the Navy had is they didn’t want to touch certain valves and hence they couldn’t do unidirectional flushing. All the excuses that came up to us, we helped the EPA put that into the plan. We couldn’t mandate it because we had to think about all the other water systems out there and not everybody has the resources to come up with a flushing plan with a hydraulic model. But the Navy is a special situation, and with the proposed 2023 EPA[]] Consent Order it allowed us that path to assist them to improve their water system. The Navy has a lot of money that was put into their maintenance program but when the money gets there it gets pushed in different directions. They have a utility, that had in our opinion, deferred maintenance over time and we want to make sure that they’re able to respond if something happens. The threat is not only Red Hill they could have a backflow issue with all the industrial processes over there and so we’re hoping that will create the model and encourage systems to learn from this and improve their systems accordingly. We’re not a permitted driven entity, we want to bring everybody into compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. We do provide funding through our low interest loans, the SRF Program to help the water systems deliver that clean water to their customers. However, the Navy as a federal entity cannot participate in our SRF Drinking Water State Revolving Fund funds but there’s a lot of funds out there for the rest of the 130+ systems around the islands. We also have principal forgiveness loans for the small systems that are disadvantaged so this is a great opportunity. I know I kind of diverted on my conversation, but I just want to promote that we do have a SRF program and we want to not only help the Navy, but we want to help all our public water systems.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"Good to know, thank you.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"My question riffs off Commissioner Katayama’s which is we didn’t have a December meeting and it would have been a good chance to think about what have we learned in the last year and what kind of institutional changes do we need to implement to function better in future potential water crises? One thing the permitted interaction group struggled with, and it seems like we’re talking more openly now, not in executive session, so that is helpful, but what is the role that the Commission plays? As you said, we need to clean up the aquifer and that has implications for how we consider our available water, if it’s contaminated, is it available at cost for cleanup? What is the role that you guys see? Couple of us know where we think the Commission should be at the table with DOH, but where does DOH see the Commission playing an important a role?",0,C1,01/24/2023
"As you know, we do have a meeting with the Navy, EPA, CWRM and USGS to talk about these things, so perhaps that could be a place where all of the trustees of the resource can determine what roles we play. I think there’s going to be a meeting of the RRAPR in February.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"First of all, I’d like to thank the DOH for the presentation today and for all that you’re doing in this regard. What’s challenging for me in these reports whether it’s the Navy or EPA or Department of Health, what does it mean for us? What is our kuleana here and how do we optimize our working relationship and collaboration with other agencies? Kathy if it exists, let me know if it can happen. I’d like your opinion on that as well as is there some kind of collaboration agreement amongst the agencies that identifies our shared goals, that talks about the duties of the parties and talks about how we are going to coordinate our action plans to optimize each other’s outcomes. Does that exist? Shouldn’t it?",0,C1,01/24/2023
I think that’s one of the goals of what we call the RRAPR (Red Hill Remediation & Restoration Action Plan Roundtable). One of the goals is to get all the trustees together and to work towards understanding with EPA and the Navy on remediation of the aquifer.,0,C1,01/24/2023
"I think that’s essential, it’s critical for us to do our job.",0,C1,01/24/2023
Kaleo has been participating in the RRAPR.,0,C1,01/24/2023
"Well it would be good to see that as we sit here and we see the actions and the duties of the parties and they coordinate a plan, then we have milestones when these reports come in we can have a discussion of what the milestone was for various agencies and their progress toward achieving that and what the variances are and then what the consequences of those variances are for our own individual efforts that are our kuleana and not yours or EPA’s or the Navy’s. So brand new year, let’s set some goals and maybe we could come up with that collaboration agreement. Second, with respect to our Commission, it seems to me and correct me if I’m not getting this and when I use the word resource, I mean freshwater resource. Our job is to protect resource quantity, to manage resource accessibility, usually that’s by giving permits to wells and so forth or in some cases taking wells offline. Third, allocate resource prudently so as this crisis unfolds it seems to me we are wanting to know are we doing all that we can and using all the tools that we have to dispatch those three key kuleana that we have. We work together with BWS and DOH - what’s the threat to this resource that we need to protect and what do we need to do? Number one, we took it offline along with the BWS so that helps to reduce the threat. With respect to resource accessibility, we’re not going to access that, we need to develop more resources, we need more well permits out there, we need to support that - what are we doing and what is the timeframe for that, what are the targets for that? Finally, as we’re allocating resources, what do we need to do to change the permits that we have outstanding? Whether it’s to the Navy or anybody else do we need to reduce people’s allocations, what do we need to do? This is not a criticism, it’s just as we look forward with excitement about how to do our jobs better in this new year. Can we get to that, where we then are having these reports and getting this information, all this detail in the context of a plan, where are targets are and where we’re on plan and where we’re ahead of plan?",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I totally agree, just in trying to keep up with DOH as our sister agency on the quality side. This past year has been really trying to figure out how to best support each other in this process. The permitted interaction group started last January and wrapped up with its report in June or July, so it took us some time to figure out where we wanted to go and what we wanted to see done. I think there’s been clear guidance at least from the Commission thus far, we need to update and refresh with this new administration of where we want to go. As Governor Green said in his State of the State Address, he and his administration are committed to taking on a more active role and coordinating at the state level. Deputy Ho will be the lead and we are all going to find ways to support her through that. Just in case you didn’t get the State of the State Address, that is what he said, Deputy Ho will be the lead. We as a member of this body, it is critical that we find ways to coordinate between DOH and the Water Commission in what we do. The RRAPR was brought up, Katie Roth, Head of our Planning Branch, it is a planning function and it’s the idea of bringing together all these various plans and commitments that have been made, related to remediation of the aquifer, but also just to short term plans of defueling into one repository of information. Commissioner Buck was also a part of that RRAPR conversation so we’ve provided critique on how we can improve that and we’re working with those parties to make it the best tool that we can all work on and use. What I do see happening is we may need to develop one specifically for the Water Commission, so we don’t get gobbled up in the larger kuleana of remediation. We have our specific goals and metrics that we want to see accomplished so that’s something I’m committed to. You will see more data and more information coming back to the Commission and my commitment is to hold space on Red Hill with this body because it is complicated, it is complex, there’s a lot of information that needs to be shared. Having something to report to you every month, I think like you mentioned, is going to be helpful to see forward progress and not a bunch of running in circles on this issue.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I certainly appreciate the Governor’s confidence in Kathy and the department and support that. We want to be a member of the team, but we have an important responsibility in and of ourselves for managing this vital resource and it seems to me it helps her do her job as well as help us do our job if we really have a clear understanding of what our needs are to make the decisions we need to make about this resource. Let’s lock that in and then you’re informed and with that you’re able to carry that to the meetings that you have with all the other agencies.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I appreciate that and if I could just chime in, I think as Kathy mentioned if this RRAPR meeting is going to occur in February, perhaps the next meeting we can have a real good hard conversation whether that is in executive session or open session. This is what I’ve been telling our DLNR divisions, our kuleana is hard enough as it is so I’m about staying in our lane, but I want to know what our lane is too. Likewise, with the Water Commission, coming back on what Commissioner Hannahs is talking about, I think we need to be very clear so that when our representative sits on that meeting, they’re advocating a clear message from where we see our kuleana to be. Kaleo will schedule that for our next meeting, and if we need a special meeting or something in preparation for that just to empower you with a clear message from the commission. Clearly, I need to get up to speed so you and I can talk story about outcomes and where we need to go forward.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I have one last portion of the website to share. This is on the Red Hill Shaft filtration and discharge into Hālawa Stream. This is the last section of the table, and it provides you with a Red Hill weekly operations report for the discharge that is going through the GAC system and into Hālawa Stream. The report of January 8-14 says that they have been averaging a discharge of 4.23 mgd per day. There have been 42 samples taken per week for influent and effluent and all the result have been non-detect. That is all I have for the report that we are giving today.",0,C1,01/24/2023
I greatly appreciate DOH’s comprehensive update to the Water Commission.,0,C1,01/24/2023
"Thank you so much for having me, my family and I were guests of the island during the contamination at Red Hill, I wanted to come today and I’ve appreciated just listening to the Commission’s role and if you’ll bear with me just ever so slightly off of the questions that Fenix already said she would offline discuss with me based on some of the data Commissioner Katayama commented about being proactive versus reactive. Our families really experienced that the down side of being reactive if you look at the future of O‘ahu’s aquifer, your public health, your environment, I think what Commissioner Katayama was saying is indeed the focus. Couple of my questions still have to do with that. One of the main ones is for the Department of Health, when did you receive groundwater sampling data for the May 2021, June 2021, July 2021 dates? I’ll leave the remainder of the question but it kind of has to do with that answer.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I did have a chance to go through your questions. The first data over that summer we did not get data from the Navy for a long time, so we didn’t get what was going on. I think our first data we received was in August 2021, so the release was made in May, it took a while to get sampling under way, etc. Then the July data we didn’t receive until the end of September and the Navy reported that the labs were backed up and it was just taking a very long time. We didn’t get those data until later and then things had already happened and eventually some effects, the ripple effect.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"Is that a common practice that the DOH struggles with, to receive data that you’re expecting to receive from the Navy? Groundwater sampling data, has that been a pattern, a history there?",0,C1,01/24/2023
"We have had some continuing issues with that, yes, partly some of it had to do with simply the volume of samples that were coming in. One of the things that is very important to us is as soon as they do get access to the data, we need to see it right away.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I guess I’ll leave it with this, to your Commission and just focusing on the future of your aquifer. Just as a resident, that to me, is a problem that we have all experienced and if somebody has the magic answer to being able to provide your Commission, families, the public, data in a timely manner, is there some force of consequence for public notice that can go out when data is delayed by default? I feel like in the future, for your aquifer and your protections if every time the Navy has something of concern, and they just decide to not give you the data, what are your recourses? Maybe getting the Governor involved to have a stronger force to come back and alert the public and the purveyor who is delinquent in getting the information. I appreciate all your work. I wish you all a wonderful and healthy future aquifer. My family and I have moved off now but we are going to continue fighting for the future for our loving friends and family on O‘ahu and for your future aquifer. I’ll take offline conversation with Fenix, I appreciate it.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"Lots of interesting conversation and lots of catching up from December. I will go through my questions. I don’t know if you saw them ahead of time. I also provided seven attachments you can look at later. I’m not going to digress from my questions. I’m going to start with environmental action levels, and I have questions, but I don’t know if they can be answered. Using a plume degradation scenario, non-degrade JP-5, action levels are currently at 266 ug/l. When posed with this question of how a sample indicating a 265 would be described as non-detect, I’m not sure why I could not get an answer yesterday. Say you’re in your house and you get your sample report back and highest action level is 266 and you get a finding of 265, would you feel comfortable having an only one-unit difference between being called it’s detected or non-detected? Mr. Brewer explained how the number is determined. Mind you at the December 15, 2022, BWS meeting, he said his spreadsheet had an error and he had to recalculate. He also explained how he is a risk assessor not a toxicologist. He says he solicits information from many sources, which is great, but in the most recent publication by the Department of Health, there are updated environmental action levels with strict calculation models for EALs. Did you use that model to develop the spreadsheet? In my questions I’m also asking for your credentials, exactly how are EAL levels decided, by whom, give us the names. Does that make you feel confident that his spreadsheet doesn’t have any more errors? Next on my agenda is sampling. During the actual sampling, Department of Health used several lower incident specific levels 300, 200 and 211. The Department of Health still hasn’t clearly explained to the public why that was, so my question is why? Upon review of the online sampling reports, it appears that any sample of TPH-g,o,d that fell below the incident specific level was determined as “non detect,” leading customers to believe their drinking water was clear of any fuel, which is not true. If a sample is collected, using the incident specific level of 200 and the sample is 199, 199 will be notated as “non detect” and not 199. Lastly, is the Department of Health and the EPA and the consent order. The thing I wanted to say and maybe a question Ms. Ho can think about, is what regulatory authority would you be giving up or the state be giving up if you partnered with the EPA on this consent order? Although I have heard you several times say that you’re going to stick with the 2015 Emergency Order, which I plan to go over tonight to compare it with the Consent Order to see what’s the big deal. What power is this that you’re trying to give up? We’re talking about the amount of water that is going from Red Hill Shaft into the Hālawa Stream. At the meeting yesterday we talked about when was the last time that fuel was detected at the Red Hill Shaft discharging millions of gallons into Hālawa Stream? There probably was a date but they have not found or determined whether all this water going into Hālawa Stream is beneficial or not but after 14 months of doing this and wasting our water, wouldn’t it be nice to know? Dennis, I appreciate your understanding of unidirectional flushing and hydraulic models and the valves. The Navy is not understanding of this and if you provide any information to them to keep them on track for the long-term monitoring project to go on, the public will send you flowers. Thank you very much.",0,C1,01/24/2023
This is public testimony. I guess it is at the option of DOH to respond but they are not required to provide a response in this forum. I just wanted to say that.,0,C1,01/24/2023
"Thank you for that, I think what we’d like to do is, there were so many questions, could we respond to her questions in writing? Is it different questions than what we received yesterday? If we put it up on our website is that the best way to respond?",0,C1,01/24/2023
"Yes, they are somewhat different.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"Ms. Picola-Davis, if you could forward those to DOH and then DOH if you could just make sure we get a copy of whatever the public response is. I would agree with Deputy Attorney General Julie China, this is public testimony but not intended to be a forum where DOH is required to answer.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I know that they are not required to answer nor was I expecting them to. I was just sharing my questions as a person of the public. I appreciate all the work that you do. These questions have been emailed to DLNR for today’s meeting and if Kathleen wants me to forward that email, I can. Kathleen you are not obliged to answer the questions, I understand that. If you choose to do that, I would appreciate it, but I know that you are a busy woman.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I really want to express appreciation for the hard work that the Commission, Commission staff, the Department of Health and their staff have been doing over the last 18 months to address this crisis. I wanted to highlight three problems. First, I appreciate that there was swift action needed to prevent the spread of AFFF concentrate after the 1,300 gallons were spilled last year. I think I have deep concerns about the capping, and it wasn’t only the capping but the backfilling over excavated areas which essentially means it is going to be very difficult to re-excavate if necessary. I’m not sure if the DOH was able to conduct an assessment, where the soil samples were taken, if they were able to take their own samples and have independent objective testing or if we are just relying on the Navy to indicate whether they were able to clean up their own mess. Also, the facility is porous right? A tremendous amount of concentrate was released in the facility, and we know that rainwater infiltrates continually. The concrete floor is also not watertight and there is also concern about what is going on in the inside - it may be difficult to assess the remediation efforts. Also looming is the fact that they are going to continue using potentially AFFF. They need some kind of fire protection capability within the facility. I think it is important that we to keep the pressure up to ensure that they don’t continue holding these forever chemicals just 100 feet above our groundwater aquifer. The chemicals are tremendously toxic parts per quadrillion - for PFOA I think that’s one drop in a thousand Olympic-sized swimming pools that could render this water unsafe under the EPA’s interim advisory guidelines. The second problem is the drinking water system that is not just the Navy but also civilian housing. I really appreciate there were multiple attempts to refine the water testing process that has been going on, but we know from the September 2022 CDC/ATSDR survey that there are almost 300 people that continue to report seeing sheens in their water as well as almost 800 people continue to have health effects. I want to urge continued thinking, regarding what might be the cause of the discrepancies. We can’t just dismiss one dataset because another dataset says the water is fine. There are folks moving into these housing units who really don’t have much informed consent to determine what their risk is should they decide to use their tap water for domestic use and consumption. We know there are many other issues with the water systems, there could be other things in there both in jet fuel which isn’t just pure TPH-d but could include antimicrobial, antifreeze chemicals as well as just issues with their water systems - as we know from the EPA’s investigation has not been operated and still isn’t being operated in compliance with safety water regulations. The third problem/issue is the need to be hypervigilant about the Navy’s water use. We just heard that they are dumping on an average 4.3 million gallons per day, multiply that by 360 days you get over 1.5 billion gallons. This Commission has been urging them for over a year now to start planning on some kind of alternative reuse of some of that water so we’re not wasting our most precious resource. There’s been discussions about evaluating the Navy’s water uses under their water use permits issued by the Commission. I do want to urge that you do take some bolder positions. I know the tendency is to be conservative about the state’s authority when it comes to the federal government, but we do have a gray area where now is the time to be assertive. If you’re going to assert an aggressive position, this is it. If it’s not now, I don’t know when that would be so to get a quick ask of you folks of the Commission members and basically everyone listening, this EPA consent decree does provide an opportunity for us to get provisions and concrete mechanisms and proactive tools that can avoid the issues with the 2015 Administrative Order and Consent which the non-enforcement have led the exacerbation of this crisis. For your Commission members in your individual capacity, your comments as trustees of our public trust, as guardians of our most precious resource will carry weight even if it is in your individual capacity. I have three basic talking points that you might want to raise or that I’d like to respectfully urge you to raise if you do choose to reach out. One is we need concrete deadlines, there’s no deadlines in the consent decree and the deadlines aren't something to be afraid of. The Navy’s pipeline repair is going to be done by November. Ask for a deadline for August, which I think is within the realm of possibility by talking to the EPA if they miss the deadline. It doesn’t mean you just let it go, you can have an order to show cause, you can have the Navy come forward and explain what kind of extenuating circumstances may have caused them to miss the deadline. It’s not like you’re going to force them to let it rip and endanger but at least you’ll have something there so the Navy knows they’ll have to identify any excuses or justifications they may have. That way we have some safeguards against some of the foot- dragging we’ve seen. Advocate for concrete deadlines where you can check on the Navy’s progress, urge the Navy not to use P5 concentrates because we don’t want another spill to push us past the point of no return and we need on-island testing. I’m happy to talk to any folks offline about these ideas and if you have any questions. Thank you for your time and attention.",0,C1,01/24/2023
"I’m from Hālawa Valley and I’ve been testifying at every board meeting since last January. I just want you to know exactly what I said last January. You are going to have meeting, after meeting, after meeting, everyone is super polite and here we go one year later. We are that much closer to another leak. My positive suggestion for Commissioner Katayama, Commissioner Hannahs, for everyone on this board, was to ask for a blow-by-blow accounting of the leaks that have happened so far. How those mistakes have been incorporated and how the defueling, blow-by-blow, minute by minute, is really going to go down from the mouths of the actual engineers. This is a major surgery from which we, the people, who will be living with the after-effects. If it is a botched surgery because we weren’t looking at the details enough, it’s going to be catastrophic. If we know anything from the past leaks, it’s not about the tanks, it really wasn’t about the pipes, it was about the humans and the system, just like Commissioner Katayama pointed out. This series of exercises of dissecting what is the plan, we need that, I would like to ask this Commission to write a letter to be in support of this with a timeline of this month. I would like independent engineers from our community other than the Navy to weigh in and talk about these details. It may take a series of at least 10 times if you ask me, but let’s just have one this month. That’s my proposal and I agree with everyone prior, and I would like to ask you two things. Can you also see yesterday’s BWS meeting? It’s going to be online you’ll see the testimonies of people there in combination with what the Department of Health and the EPA were saying. I think it’s a must see along with the movie Dark Waters, that will explain to us what we are facing with our aquifers with respect to the forever chemicals. Thank you for your time.",0,C1,01/24/2023

Briefing on Moloka‘i Water Plan Preliminary Draft by Maui Department of Water Supply,0,C2,08/15/2023
Residents of Moloka‘i’s West side for 10 years. • There are many ecological issues & the current system doesn’t provide sufficient water to address those issues. • Hoping Townscape can create a plan to bring all residents together. • Townscape has been good at listening to all the voices on the island.,0,C2,08/15/2023
"Sherri Hiraoka & Bruce Tsuchida, Townscape, Inc.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Katie Roth of the CWRM Planning Branch introduced Sherri Hiraoka and Bruce Tsuchida with Townscape, Inc. Townscape shared a preliminary water use and demand presentation for the island of Moloka‘i including water resource issues, existing water production, future water demand, and a framework for allocating water. There was much discussion over increased allotments and cheaper water delivery for the West end of Molokaʻi. After extensive community outreach, they discovered shared values among the residents and received constructive feedback on an earlier draft proposal.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Thanks. This is really helpful just to see you, Bruce and Sherri. I was wondering you know in your growth projections when there's low growth to high growth that's growth in demand? I guess I'm thinking about this as like you see growth sometimes the assumption is population but you could have the same population or declining population wanting to do ag and have increased production. So that's a little bit disentangled in the following slides but can you speak more to how you constructed that framework for growth because I think it needs to be on really unpacked.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Well, we're actually just kind of revising all of that right now. The difficulty we're having is just in the kind of information we can find. I know for like the Honolulu Watershed Management plans we really tie the water demands to a per capita number. It's been difficult to do that for Moloka‘i just because there are a number of private systems and, just being able to figure out, just tie that to specific numbers. So, I think for in our revisions we're trying to just take another look at all of that. We had done I think a more broad brush like you were suggesting where it was a growth in water demand, a 0.5 increase in water demand, but yeah we're taking another look at all of that.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"I guess...oh, sorry go ahead.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Can I comment here just briefly? Part of the problem here for the demand projections is there's a major difference in what position, politics, community focus. A major difference between many of the folks who are living on the west end of the island and other folks, central and east Moloka‘i. Many of the folks on the west end say they want and need and should have a lot more water, especially for agriculture and other folks in central and east Moloka‘i have the position that west has always been dry. It's never been good agricultural land and therefore should not be demanding water from other parts of the island to satisfy agricultural use that doesn't belong there. So those are two very different positions, obviously. And we don't have at this point in time a good answer for those differences in position relative to water and water supply.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Sure, and it's not your folks job to have to arbitrate that, I guess. But I guess what this reminds me of is last month's meeting on the East Honolulu and how we calculate, how we think about water use in general, not just here. Agricultural water use needs to be cheap to support agriculture but it's not an, you know it's not a high value. So, like if somebody in the southwest on the continent is a purveyor, they'd rather sell it to somebody who can pay a higher rate than a farmer. And given Moloka‘i's aspirations to be a certain kind of landscape, I think it'd be useful to disaggregate kind of how we think about demand and not just agricultural and domestic or municipal but also like unpacked regionally because the value and access to water is, value is high on West End, access is low. And it's plentiful. I really appreciate those pie charts because I've been around the discussions around the Kualapu‘u, but I had not seen the whole island in view. And I think regionally the value as you pointed out, the value sets but also like for the O‘ahu Water Plans, we don't really have to deal with sort of population growth and agriculture are usually in the same areas except maybe Central. So, like really thinking about how the metrics are appropriate for Moloka‘i and then different sectors might be helpful. And I'll think about how maybe if there's a way to sort of display the data or calculate things that might be more helpful for people to see or for you folks to think about. I just wanted to comment on that. You know that projections of growth, because Moloka‘i doesn't, having spent time with folks there, population growth is something they're quite afraid of. Maybe really unpacking that in terms of what growth and water needs are in the future. Am I being clear?",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Yes. Bruce, Sherri, thank you very much for your work and I know your work and I know what you put into it and so I really appreciate how challenging this is and what you're dedicating in terms of your talent and your time to produce this plan. I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that the values are shared and I'm wondering whether or not using those values as guideposts for resolving the demand battles could be an effective way to proceed in the next steps ahead because if you said they're broadly shared that means West Side folks and East Side folks all believe in those things. So, isn't it a way to test solutions or plan action items by saying, what does this do? Does this align with our values or does this meet a need that has emerged or exists over time or will emerge in the future but doesn't really align with our values? Because then you have to revisit the values in that case. So, I would just encourage, you know, if we make this a tug of war over your needs versus my needs, you know you got winners and losers. But if we elevate the discussion to values that we share then how do we all participate in and manage this resource in a way that is consistent with those values and then maybe that has to change our demand profile and so forth. But rather it be a personal battle of West Side guys won this one, Eastside guys won that one. It's about no, our values prevailed and we adjusted our behavior and our expectations because we all believe in those values. So, I'll leave that with you or do you want to comment on that? Do you think that it’s a pipe dream? Or is that a perfect world, yeah it works on paper but not in reality?",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Thank you, Neil. I would say that I think that that's what we were hoping to do with the values and we actually did dig a little bit deeper and under each of the values we do have some principles and took some goals and principles to really strive for. And our intent was to use all of that, as you were saying, to help identify water resource options and then to kind of look at those and say, okay what seems to make sense now. Not just you know yes, that can provide water for this demand, but does that align with the values and the goals and the principles. As far as whether or not that's a pipe dream, we'll see. We're gonna try. I'm sure that some of the aligning will feel very natural and will make a lot of sense and some of it might be a little bit more difficult and we'll have to do a lot more work. So, we're gonna try.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Well, I think it's the right approach and good luck with it. A couple more thoughts, Commissioner Miike. While I was pleasantly surprised by that, I was shocked not to see more discussion of watershed management and the threats to watershed represented by an ungular population that is really getting out of control. Did I miss it or are they not speaking about that?",0,C2,08/15/2023
They are speaking about that. We were just trying to figure out what to present in a short amount of time.,0,C2,08/15/2023
"Okay, okay. Sherri Hiroaka: But yes, that did come up.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Well no, I have to comment here though, Neil. I understand your question and as you know for the watershed plans we've been doing for Board of Water Supply for the various watersheds on O‘ahu, we've dug pretty deeply into watershed management issues and ideas and potential projects. However, for Moloka‘i any depth of watershed management thinking and planning is not and I have to emphasize is not part of our scope. The Water Department not to put words in their mouth, but basically said that's not their purview and that's not the kind of plan that they can or will fund for Moloka‘i Water. So, although there is some mention of those issues and principles in our preliminary draft plan, we do not have the scope or capacity to dig deeply into those issues. Very important clearly but will not be part of this plan.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"I mean there's not much to if we keep letting the source be degraded, there's going to be less and less to distribute no matter how you look at it. And when I look at those values you got plenty of places to put those points. You know there's so many of those values address the issue of, are we caring for the ‘āina at the source of where this water is? Are we encouraging the rain to fall? Are we capturing it and having it recharge and so forth. I don't know, I get maybe you're getting some pushback on that issue on creep of mission or mission creep or scope creep, but you can't talk about water without talking about source and the management of that source. The last thing is and this came up in an earlier conversation are you looking at the effect, the relationship between increased agricultural use and recharge because I saw that big spike in planned agricultural use. So, is that going to have a beneficial effect? If we make that investment to take that leap of faith then we're going to take water and I don’t know whether it's coming from another ahupua‘a or whatever and put it on the agricultural crops, is that going to yield an increase in the underlying groundwater aquifer?",0,C2,08/15/2023
"I guess I'm not sure how much you would want to see about that. I don't think that we could do any specific studies. I mean a lot of that is going to depend on the kind of agriculture, the type of irrigation practices, and whatnot. So, it's something that we can mention as a possibility, but I don't think it's something that we could quantify.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"I guess that's the point. Yes, please mention that because you do aerial spray that you know all this water, a lot of evaporation and so forth. You can put a million gallons out there and it has very little effect versus more effective best practice delivery systems that are way more efficient and have the beneficial effect on the natural systems, I think gotta be in this report somewhere.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Okay, thank you. Thank you. Larry.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"First to comment on what Neil just said. It seems to me that the more efficient you are in your irrigation practices the less water goes down to the aquifer. It'll never leak so, that's an issue. In my experience with Moloka‘i and past Water Commission hearings, when you have a public hearing you are viciously attacked, but when the meeting is over people come up and are very gracious about it. So, take it with a grain of salt what you get. You know seems like you're getting personally attacked. My main question is looking at your map about various aquifers and the amount of water being used now, it seems to be that unless you start diverting water from the streams two or three beyond Kalaupapa, you’re about maxed out on surface water usage. So, it seems inevitable that if you're going to have population growth decided by how people, where they want to live, you're going to have to move water across ahupua‘a. The only alternative is that you force people to move to ahupua‘a that have a lot of water and I don't think that's reasonable. So, I think it's inevitable that you're going to have to begin to share water across and no matter how people divide, unless they want growth that's going to happen.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Sherri and Bruce, you know sitting here at DLNR what I've come across in many communities but Moloka‘i in particular, it is just the mistrust of government. And I think it's a missed opportunity by the county to not, watershed management I mean that is critical to the people on Moloka‘i. And sometimes I think we put ourselves in these little vacuums and we say okay that’s out of our lane, you know maybe that's a DLNR, that's the county, but the people on Moloka‘i they look at it in a very holistic way and when we don't look at it through their lens I think we really miss an opportunity. Because you know people on Moloka‘i and they are the most territorial people. I mean Western people do not tell Eastend people or Central people what to do. And they’re all good with that. I mean they're very respective, but I don't know when you talk about community, I mean what kind of community engagement and participation have you been getting? You know it is a challenging community, but Bruce you are probably one of the best people in this area to do this and your opening comment was that this is the most contentious, complex. I would say from DLNR I'm really challenged with Moloka‘i, too and I realize you got to just show up and you have to be present. What are some of the challenges that you're finding because this is such an important plan for them and it's for us as well. What are you finding?",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Well, I would say that there's technical side stuff and then there's community side stuff. Technical side stuff it's just and we've experienced this with any and all of the water planning that we've done. It's just the type of information we can get if we get information from different sources that don't always match up, different types of data sets so trying to figure out okay what can we do with what we have that seems to make sense and then what assumptions do we have to make to kind of fill in the gaps. So, I would say that's part of it for Moloka‘i specifically there are a number of, there are more water systems than we've had to work with in the past so there's that public and private. And in some cases there's some interconnectedness between the systems so that makes it a little bit more interesting. I think on the technical side there's that. On the community side you know people have been really gracious. They’re very sure to let us know what they think and what they want, but they've been very gracious and we've been very appreciative about that. But water is a precious resource and the water use especially geographically is changing and things that are in the land use plan are different from what you know the land uses that have been there in the past and so that is going to have implications for the different resources. And I think that's what we're coming up against and so the community is challenging us to help them figure out how to move forward on that.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Yeah, more specifically if I may as you folks will know, one of the major problems with land use and planning and water for Moloka‘i is Moloka‘i Ranch. Their water system is from all accounts that we've heard dilapidated, deteriorated and in very bad shape. Their water rates are reportedly the highest in the United States. West End folks are saying they need a lot more water and they need water at much more reasonable rates, but they're not gonna get that anytime soon given the status quo with the ranch. The ranch has been up for sale for many years, hasn't been sold. Will it be sold? Who knows, but unless and until there can be new owners and new managers for the West End water system, I'm afraid that these problems will persist. So, no easy solution to that.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"I just want to speak up a little bit for the Moloka‘i community because you have to pay the price for some of the post-traumatic stress that's been imposed upon them and people didn't listen. People, you know, colonized, people did things that really affected them, and they weren't a part of the process. And so yeah you take some blows maybe or you get some of that blowback as soon as you walk in the door. But when you sit down, they’re at the table vigilantly. They show up, they're articulate, it's multi-generational, and when you start speaking to values, that's what I'm so hopeful about the values, they're really beautiful values and they just want to see alignment with those values. And you would keep the discussion there and then be true to that. Don't just waha, it can’t just be words it has to be action and align with that. Things fall into place a lot easier than if you just have kind of a defensive action about, oh I didn't do that or she did that or he did that or the ranch did that and so forth. They don't lead to good places, but if we can get the values we can lead to better places.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"I do have a question for Townscape. When you did these meetings were you meeting with people sort of communities separately in place? Did they have an opportunity, you hear everybody, but do they have an opportunity to hear each other directly or go to those places you see? I mean okay so that has been part of the process?",0,C2,08/15/2023
"We did both. We did individual small group. We did kind of pop-ups in different communities where we had a table set up. People could drop by; we were open for like several hours. We could talk story, that kind of thing. And then we also did have the larger community meetings with everyone.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"But do they have an opportunity to hear each other sort of outside this draft? I know they probably talk on island, but to see the implications of if West End needs more water then these guys might not, might see a decline. You know has there been the ability to have that discussion and then also in your plan are you including, I've seen this done you know like potential scenarios as straw man, straw people to shoot at. Is that incorporated into what you folks are gonna do like here's one scenario, what do you think? Here's another. Is that in there?",0,C2,08/15/2023
"That is something that we're kind of still working on because we are still revising the water demands, but that is something that’s pretty interesting. It sounds like something that could be helpful in I guess helping people to understand the perspectives of the different people and the different parts of the island and the different types of water needs. So, thank you.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Yeah, I think I saw it in written testimony people don't want to be feeling like they're pitted against each other so how can this process try to bring people together or understand where that compromise lies? You know here's one extreme situation, all the water goes to West end; okay, that's unacceptable here. Okay, keep it all on the East end; okay that's unacceptable. So, it might help people sort of get more tangible and focus on solutions, so I just want to suggest that. And I'm sure there are other good ideas that come out of community.",0,C2,08/15/2023
"Yes, my name's Norman Rizk and I came to kind of flesh out some of the things that Sherri and Bruce are talking about the West end. I'm the president of the West Moloka‘i Association. It's an organization that represents owners of 811 properties in the West end and the owners and their families are actually about 2,000 people. The whole population of Moloka‘i is 7,300 so it's not a small group and what I would hope to do is give you a brief view of the West end from the residences’ point of view, filling out some of the things that were just discussed by Sherri and Bruce. And I just want to say from the beginning that we have a lot of confidence in Sherri and Bruce trying to tie all this together and bring people together around a solution which I do believe is very possible given the amount of water on Moloka‘i. We're only using nine percent of the sustainable yield right now. The concern has been this, on the West end, has been mainly because of our numbers and being on the driest part of the island. We still only get about five percent of the water and we get our water from and our rate payers too, Moloka‘i Public Utility, which is a utility owned by an offshore company Guoco, a corporation domiciled in Hong Kong. So, it's not just the ranch, it's the owners of the ranch and historically management decisions are pretty much forcibly based on the oversea owner's financial goals, not on the needs of the people of the West end. This was most obvious in 2008 when they tried to shut down the whole water system and we were threatened with getting 50 gallons a day of water by trucking. So, this is why it's such a sensitive point. Things are better now to a certain degree, but access to affordable water is still a huge issue. Right now, we're provided with only very expensive potable water at about seven to eight dollars per thousand gallons. And because our largest lots are Papohaku Ranch Land lots are zoned agricultural, we are required to devise “farm plans” dedicating at least 51 percent of the property on the lot to general agricultural use to obtain a building permit. So, this is nearly impossible without any ag water. So that's a major problem. Now 50 years ago if you look back, the West end development plans from these offshore companies were mainly those of a high-end resort, but I would say the West end in the 25 years I've been there has morphed into a community that shares many characteristics with the rest of the island. Our HOA or Homeowner Association, in fact, just changed the CC&Rs to encourage rather than prohibit commercial agriculture. It's part of what Sherri was talking about. Essentially none of our members really want a densely populated resort with widespread commercial franchises, so I'd like to put to rest any fears in the community that granting water would mean explosive growth. Nobody in the West end wants explosive growth either and people move there for the values. So, in fact if you do a survey as we've been doing this last month of all of our owners on the larger lots, these are 50 to 20 acre lots, about a third of them right now living on about 450 acres say they want to use water right now for small-scale agriculture, reforestation, and erosion control. And the erosion control is a big deal because of the ungulates trampling the land and silting out the reefs every time it rains. (Chair Chang exits meeting briefly.) So, I think what West enders would like would be to grant an appropriate amount of ag waters for these purposes. We could work out the exact recommendations with Townscape. We'd also have to figure out the infrastructure of financing and whether there's any Federal infrastructure dollars that could help. Many people in the West end would like the County to take over the water system since we're not sure that Guoco has our best interests in mind or shares our values. If we had some ag water we could supplant the use of potable water for planting which is really inappropriate, not financially viable. And it would also settle the litigation and the increasingly divisive disputes over rights to groundwater from the Kualapu‘u Aquifer which is being potentially oversubscribed. So, these things are all possible. It’s a question of setting aside the differences and coming together to express values that I think many, many people share. And about Townscape, you know a lot of our people were really upset after the first draft, but I think Sherri and Bruce have really, really addressed that. We had like 150 letters and emails the first draft, but we have a lot of confidence in them and we very much appreciate their working, in as Bruce said, a contentious environment. And we want to collaborate with them. That's what I’d like to say about it. Mahalo for your attention and it is true that your eventual decision will help determine the fate and character of the West end of the island, but I do think it is a solvable dilemma and the resources are there. It's more a question of people coming together.",0,C2,08/15/2023

"Neal Fujii, CWRM State Drought & Water Conservation Coordinator Staff stated the summary of request to authorize the Deputy Director to enter into a MOA with the Division of State Parks to allow a deep monitor well into the Waimea Aquifer System Area within the Hāpuna Beach Recreation Area.",1,B1,12/19/2023
Do we typically enter into MOAs with ourselves because it's the State with the State. Is that a regular practice?,1,B1,12/19/2023
This is the first one I can think of but I think it was because the Hāpuna Park is also under management by the National Park Service.,1,B1,12/19/2023
"Real quick, it’s a requirement. There's, I forget the acronym, but basically there's a conservation easement over this area that National Park Service regulates and so State Parks is the implementor of that conservation easement. Any type of land uses that could impact the recreation of that area have to get approval through National Park Service and also State Parks so this was a formal agreement in consultation with National Park Service that they required in order for them to be very clear on what the extent of this project is within the context of the larger Hāpuna Recreational Area. It's specific to that land use control ultimately that requires this type of MOU and Agreement.",1,B1,12/19/2023
We normally don't do MOAs.,1,B1,12/19/2023
"Right, but was that in the report? I think it's germane to have in the record and the minutes are okay just so that we don't set a precedent in here where every time we deal with another State agency we're doing an MOA.",1,B1,12/19/2023
Thank you for that.,1,B1,12/19/2023
"Aloha mai kākou, Commissioners. Jonathan Likeke Scheuer. On this particular matter I testified at the September meeting as an individual. I am also here again as an individual. There was a meeting after the September meeting where staff reached out. We discussed some of the issues, I followed up with a long email with nine suggested things that I thought would address the concerns that I had raised. The commitment that this is not trying to discover deep confined groundwater addresses nearly all of the concerns that I have so I'm very appreciative of the changes to the submittal. To be super clear I'm not opposed in theory to trying to discover whether or not there's deep confined groundwater in different places but it should be done in a particular, methodical way as well as towards management of that resource. My largest concern slash question is in the chart that's included in the submittal. A typical deep monitor well plan it says depth shall be as directed by the engineer based on the conditions encountered in the field. I'm just wondering what kind of particular direction and restriction is being given in this authority. Related to that I'll just note that the decision made here is in some ways related to what will come up on item B4, the delegation of authority because if I read before correctly this kind of exploratory well would remain as a delegated authority to the chair, not something that would appear in front of the Commissioners. The chance for the public or practitioners or other people to comment on this in conjunction with the proposal in B4 doesn't exist. I realize this is just an MOA but the way before is written is that there's not allowing for this kind of thing to appear in front of the Commission if there are other concerns associated with the development.",1,B1,12/19/2023
And we'll get into a lot more of the B4 discussion but thank you.,1,B1,12/19/2023
Just noting that those two are related. I'm very appreciative of the staff’s work on this.,1,B1,12/19/2023
"Let's take a hard look again. In line with Commissioner Hannahs, let's make sure that the MOA reflects that NPS requirement because it does not.",1,B1,12/19/2023
"We will work with finalizing, there's a draft MOA language that we worked on already with National Park Service and State Parks but to make it very clear what that trigger is and why we're executing the MOA, we'll put that in the intent purpose of the MOA or MOU.",1,B1,12/19/2023

"The next item on the agenda is Item No. B1, it is the Navy  Navy Region and Navy Facilities Overviews/Updates of Red Hill Remediation and Closure, Redft Recovery and Monitoring, and Monitoring Well Development and Water Data. I think General Hashimoto, you are at the table. Again, thank you very much. This is the second update to the water commission. We have greatly appreciated the Navy appearance before the commission intended to provide us some good information about the current status of your  the cleanup at Red Hill. So go ahead, General Hashimoto, and if you could also introduce your staff.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Aloha, Chair Chang, Deputy Chair Manuel, Commissioners, Ladies and Gentlemen. My name is Major General Mark Hashimoto, and I represent the United States Indo-Pacific Command. And mahalo for this opportunity to provide updates on matters that are directly related to the water itself and that are also forward-looking. We are going to provide updates on Red Hill site remediation and closure, shaft recovery and monitoring, and monitoring well development, as well as water data. As Chair Chang mentioned, the last time we were here was the meeting on March 21st. During that meeting, we had a few follow-ups to  besides providing a general update periodically, and those had to do with soil vapor extraction, as well as GAC flow optimization, so those will be covered as well as a general update as part of today's brief. What I'd like to start with before we get into the specifics of the agenda item is I'd like to have the JoinTask Force-Red Hill provide an update on the defueling operations. And we'll start with Lieutenant Colonel Wingear.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Good morning. My name is Lieutenant Colonel Casey Wingear. I am the new chief of staff for the Joint Task Force-Red Hill. I replaced Colonel Kevin Williams, who briefed you last time in March. Although new to the position, I am not new to the joint task force. I joined the joint task force when it was stood up in September, and I've been serving as Admiral Wade's executive assistant and a planner on the team. Thank you for the opportunity to provide an update. It's truly an honor. As you know, the mission is for the joint task force to safely and expeditiously defuel the Red Hill facility and to rebuild the trust with the people of Hawai‘i. When we assumed this mission, Admiral Wade was committed to building a plan to iterate and increase our understanding of that plan, to learn, and in partnership with the regulators, find ways to speed up the process to start and finish defueling Red Hill. Next slide, please. As you may remember, this is our Integrated Master Schedule, and I want to draw your attention to the yellow box on the top (inaudible) when we updated you last time. The (inaudible) we are on plan to commence gravity defueling starting in August  October of 2023 with a completion date of January of 2024. This is five months earlier than briefed.- time. This process will remove 104 million gallons or approximately 99 percent of the fuel in the facility. We realize that there still remains a substantial amount of fuel, approximately 100,000 gallons when we complete this phase, and to  and we are  to be clear, we will remove every last drop of fuel from the facility. We are currently in planning to determine how best to safely and expeditiously remove that residual fuel and we will add additional supplements to complete that plan that will address all actions to remove that fuel. I want to draw your attention to the Plans line, a couple of key points along this one. First in May, Defuel Supplement 2 that was submitted by  or was released by the Department of Defense on May 16th, and that plan outlines how we are going to execute defueling operations on this accelerated timeline. Since that release, it has since been approved by the Department of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency. Moving a little bit further to the right, in July, you'll see a decision point for tankers for the October start date. We did, in fact, meet all conditions for that decision point, and Admiral Wade informed the Secretary of Defense and also the Defense Logistic Agencies to move forward with the contracting actions to have tankers online for this accelerated start date. Moving down to the Response line, down in July, you'll see a fueling spill; that was our final interagency exercise that we just completed on the 13th of this month, and we are currently training our roving security and fire watch teams to complete a culminating capstone event to move a couple diamonds to the right for the fire watch capstone event in August, to be conducted on the 16th and 17th. Moving down to the bottom on the NEPA line, since our last update, we completed the 30-day public comment period in June, and we are on track to complete the NEPA process by the end of August. Moving up one to the Ops line, we completed the dewatering process, which, as you may remember, removes water from the tanks and the pipelines to prevent corrosion and to ensure the quality of the fuel. A little bit to the right there, we did complete tank tightness testing, which ensures the integrity of the tanks. And a little bit further to the right there in July, we are currently in the process of draining the surge tanks. We should be complete sometime next week. This process will remove 480,000 gallons of fuel from the facility. Each of these evolutions are meticulously planned, trained to, rehearsed, response drills are exercised, and they are all each approved by the regulators before execution. are currently in the process of that same methodology for the next one, as you can see if you go down from the August timeframe, fuel repacking. Repacking will be conducted at the end of August, and it will be the first time that we reintroduce fuel into the pipelines starting from the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam side up to the Red Hill facility since we actually unpacked the lines, as you may remember, back in October-November of last year. And last on this slide, moving up to the Repair and Maintenance, you'll see in June, the DOD repairs need to be complete; in July, the third-party quality validation items need to be complete; and then in August, repair approval received which comes from the Department of Health. Next slide, please. This is our",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Chair Chang. Chair Chang, may I?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yes, please go ahead. Is that Neil?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Before you leave  before you leave the slide, Lieutenant Colonel Wingeart, thank you for using the dashboard and keeping the goalposts in place so we can see our progress toward the end line. I have two questions. What about that 6 percent of the fuel you can't defuel immediately makes it problematic? Why is that a problem?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"It's not necessarily a problem in terms of it just randomly leaking out; it just takes a long time to remove because it's stuck in pipelines at bends or low points, and it takes a different process than gravity to remove it.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I see. Thank you. And with your  respect to your NEPA public comment, can you give a high-level summary of what the comments of the public were and what your responses were?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"There were, I want to say, approximately 20 comments, of which, if I remember right, I think six were substantial, and that process for reviewing those comments and addressing each of those concerns is ongoing.",0,B1,07/26/2023
So what was the nature of the six that were,0,B1,07/26/2023
I'd have to come back to you with the  those specifics.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yes, I see Aurora.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah. While we're also still on this slide, what  and I don't know if this is in your purview, but what kind of monitoring and surveillance is there to, say, quite quickly identify potential spills, you know, with repacking and defueling? Is that (inaudible)",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah, I can start.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So the roving security and fire watch team that I mentioned that we're currently training, that team will be a 68-person element that will be in the facility 24/7 roaming.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So moving up and down the pipelines so that we can identify, if there is a problem, quickly, and then take action as required.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"When you refer to facility, do you mean just around the tanks, or does that facility include all of the pipelines all the way down to the piers?",0,B1,07/26/2023
It includes the pipelines.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"And if I could add, in addition to that, we are continuing with the groundwater monitoring that is occurring as well as the soil vapor monitoring that is occurring within the vicinity of the tank gallery.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah. So my understanding is that is, again, around the tanks, but there's potential for",0,B1,07/26/2023
"has expanded. The original were all within the tank gallery, but it has expanded.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"One other aspect, ma'am, if you may remember, we  we have increased our video monitoring system as well. We've supplemented what was in the facility with some new purchases so that we can monitor  supplement our roving security watch with a little bit more camera ability.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"If I can also turn to DOH, and is DOH working, and on which side?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"DOH is working along with EPA, and they are training their  they go through the same  the exercises with EPA and DOH along with the Navy (inaudible).",0,B1,07/26/2023
I have a  I have a question. You said a 68-team roving  a 68-person roving team.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Roving security and fire watch, yes, ma'am.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Is that per shift, or is that in total?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"That's in total.  ll be broken down into multiple teams. Each of them will have a lead who is a subject matter expert in that field, and then each of them are going through our training process right now.",0,B1,07/26/2023
And they're gonna be responsible for different sectors of the,0,B1,07/26/2023
"When the team is on, each person will be identified into a certain section, yes. And then, obviously, when the new team comes on, they will cover the same areas.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Thank you. I know that  while we're at it, I'm assuming that means, like, 24-hour coverage.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Any other questions from the commissioners before we move on from this slide? (No response.),0,B1,07/26/2023
"All right, thank you. Go ahead.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"This is our defueling dashboard. We update this every other week, and it's posted to our website and to our apps. I want to draw your attention to the center of the slide, where you see the four gauges. This is how you can track our progress to maintain our We are on track for the early-mid-October start date. On the far left, working left to right, you'll see that we have completed all 253 mandatory repairs as planned. We are complete with 246 through the third-party quality validation program. All 46 of those packets have been submitted to the Department of Health for their review and approval. Finally, on the far right, you'll see that the Department of Health has conditionally approved 178 of those packets we've submitted to them. We feel like we're in a good place between us and the regulators, and we are on glide path to maintain an early start date of October 2023. The last highlight on this slide is in the bottom right, where you'll see two QR codes. These are to our apps to help you download them so you can receive information and track our progress as we defuel the facility. In summary, we still have a lot of work to do, but we are on plan to start defueling early on a mid-October start date. I want to thank you for the time to provide this update, pending any questions you have. Thank you.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Does anybody have any questions? Can I just ask, actually, Kathy Ho, this is a question I have for you, what's DOH's capacity to review all of these documents and materials that are being..submitted to you for review?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"We have a small but dedicated team, and we are on track for an August dead  I think it's August 6th deadline to have reviewed and  all of the packets that have been submitted to us.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Thank you. That's (inaudible).,0,B1,07/26/2023
"To check just with regard to the NEPA comments and your response, since I don't know when you're coming before the commission again, can you get that  work with our staff to get that to them, and they can get that information to us?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Of course, we'll do so.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Any other comment, Commissioners? Questions?(No response.)",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I don't see any hands.  Okay, General Hashimoto, is there any other updates?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yes, we do. I'd like to",0,B1,07/26/2023
pass it on to Don here. He can introduce himself and talk about tank closure plan timelines and status.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for  appreciate the invite down here today. I'Donald Hampton. I work for Navy region of Hawai‘i, overseeing the tank closure plan for Navy Region of Hawai‘i. The slide you're seeing right now is a brief synopsis of all of the products we have submitted along the timeline that we have submitted them. We are making progress going forward. We're working with regulators through ongoing meetings, responding to the requests for additional information so we can provide amplifying information to make informed decisions. We're on a good glide path right now, and we are moving the tank closure plan forward. As you're aware, we're still in the planning phase of the tank closure plan, and it's scheduled to start once defueling is completed with this last spec of it.",0,B1,07/26/2023
If you can highlight Supplement 2.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"And Supplement 2 is the one released since last time this group met and that provided amplifying information on closure in place, which is a recommendation for the tanks, and envisions a structural analysis report, and we responded to EPA's RFIs on the tank closure plan. All of this information which you'll see on the next slide is in the  I'll pause here. Any questions on this",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I don't see any hands. Go ahead, Donald, the next slide.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"The next slide, please. This is just a (inaudible) on this (inaudible) changes in the graphic. The tank closure plan is broken down into four phases. Phase 1 and Phase 2 are in progress right now, which is the planning effort. Phase 3 and Phase 4 will commence once defueling is completed, and that's the physical aspect of the tank disclosure plan.   I'd also like to note right down here, on the bottom middle right there is also a QR code. All that information on the tank closure plan, also anything related to Red Hill and other websites, will be in the QR code. All this information that we're showing here today of all the plans, the supplementals, requests for information, our responses to the requests for information are all posted on the public-facing website via that QR code.",0,B1,07/26/2023

"Oh, it's on the next slide.  -",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Sorry, I think my question is addressed on the next slide, so",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Next slide, please. Okay. This is Phase 2 of the tank closure plan that may be contracted out for public outreach on beneficial nonfuel reuse. Basically, what we need to do in Phase 2 is to identify, evaluate, and discuss options with a public outreach program for the state of Hawai‘i. Nakupuna is doing this effort for us. It is broken down into three phases. Initially, there was an open survey requesting any feedback at all of any recommendations anybody might have. The second part of this was one-on-one interviews with key stakeholders across O‘ahu, which has been completed. And the third phase, which will be going out at the end of this month, is a mail survey to particular area codes  zip codes here within O‘ahu.  All of this information will be comprised into a final report; that final report will be publicly posted and released via our website. The public final report will also be briefed at the fall FTAC this year.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So how did you  oh,",0,B1,07/26/2023
"No, no, no. Go ahead, Vivian. Go ahead.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Can you describe how you identified the key stakeholders?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"The key stakeholders were brought in from all  many aspects of  a lot of them were recommendations going from people that have had a lot of involvement with Red Hill overall. Some people that have been more outspoken with Red Hill, depending on any aspect of a reason why, people have sent in RFIs to us just with generic questions that we responded to; since they were interested in Red Hill, we actually reached out to them too.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Okay. So these are organizations?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Organizations or individuals. The key stakeholders are organizations, help me's, or just private citizens.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Including groups that were highly critical of,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Sierra Club was included in that, ma'am, and also Board of Water Supply.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Any other  oh, yes, Neil. Go ahead.",0,B1,07/26/2023
What criteria have you...o be employed to make the decision as to repurposing,0,B1,07/26/2023
"So I'll expand upon this a little bit. The tasking for us in the tank closure plan was to go out and identify, evaluate, and discuss options. Okay? Taking this forward, honestly, there are three independent efforts going on in reference to beneficial reuse. There's the NDA effort looking at DOD reuse.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah, which was being led  which is independent of this one, this effort here. And also, the Office of Naval Research gave a grant to the University of Hawai‘i to look at nonfossil fuel possible reuse. All these three independent efforts are gonna be consolidated into a final report in the latter part of this year, and there will be a brief to Congress in February of 2024. Coming out of Congress, those next steps, I don't have all of those next steps at this time, but I know, finally, it will be an engagement between the Department of Defense and the State of Hawai‘i of what the options  future options could be.",0,B1,07/26/2023
But there must be some criteria for analysis,0,B1,07/26/2023
"cost, time, safety, public  so can you  can you elucidate, yes.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So when we get all the options in, I'll say there's gonna be a handful that have merit, and the ones that are decided  deemed to have merit are going to go through a feasibility analysis. Because they have merit doesn't mean they're environmentally approved or utility point of approval or structural, so we're gonna have to do a final feasibility analysis, and that feasibility analysis will narrow down the list of options that are feasible  have merit, and that are feasible to implement.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"You're giving me process, but I'm not hearing the substance of the criteria. Like such as the",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Cost, time, feasibility, and sustainability.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So what  so sustainability, what does sustainability mean?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"That it can  it's something that can be sustained politically, environmentally, financially in the long term.",0,B1,07/26/2023
And do you think that's reflective  those criteria are reflective of the concerns of the public that you're getting from Nakupuna or any otherpublic input process?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yes. A lot of the feedback we've gotten, sir, is something that would support  benefit the State of Hawai‘i that could be from a usage point of view, an economic point of view. It has to be  also, the feedback, it has to be a hundred percent environmental compliance and protect the environment. So those, I'll say, themes are coming back.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah, I think that's what we're interested in here.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I think over time, it's a really good question because what we're talking about is one of the criteria, as you bring up, and then, as with any sort of decision of this magnitude, it's the weighting of each criteria.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And so I think this  this effort to get as much input as possible would get, I think, at what you're talking about because while many of these  these are all important decision-making criteria, there are some, I think, that would be reflective of, you know, what the public would expect. And so, again, we're just in the data-collection phase, and as you know, we move into later decision-making, I think absolutely, you know, these kinds of...",0,B1,07/26/2023
"If it's, as Lieutenant Wingeart  Lieutenant Colonel Wingeart said, you want to rebuild trust, I think that there needs to be some transparency about that",0,B1,07/26/2023
"because the fear of somebody who doesn't trust assumes that maybe it's not their interest that's being  that's prioritized, it's money",0,B1,07/26/2023
"or it's something else. So if you lay those cards out on the table and we talk about the prioritization, I think it's  it's more transparent, and there will be a balance, obviously, and I think that's",0,B1,07/26/2023
I think that's (inaudible).,0,B1,07/26/2023
And it'll all be for all to see.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"It's a balance, you know. As I think we could appreciate, it's not  probably won't be formulaic, you know, if you will, but yeah. Thank you.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"General Hashimoto, can I ask you who will ultimately make the decision on the reuse?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Ma'am, this is Donald Hampton. I would say the ultimate decision will be between the Departmentof Defense engaging with the State of Hawai‘i.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Engaging with the State of Hawai‘i.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"The State of Hawai‘i. There will be some very senior meetings going back and forth of this  the ones that had merit and that are feasibly capable, and there will be some discussions between the Department of Defense and the State of Hawai‘i to pursue an ultimate solution and recommendation.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Is the State of Hawai‘i the governor? Is that  who is the State of Hawai‘i?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Under  under ordinary circumstances, when we're dealing with an underground storage tank, it would be the Department of Health. Obviously, the Department of Health would reach out to other agencies within the State of Hawai‘i and have discussions with members of the public as well.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I have two questions. Maybe for you, first, following the  and then for Mr. Hampton. So given that  would the process for public input, then, be through FTAC because DOH, you know, doesn't have, like C1, a regular open process? For helping make that kind of follow-up decision. Or is there gonna be another (inaudible)?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"It probably  you know, we 202I haven't really thought that through yet",0,B1,07/26/2023
"because we still have to see what is the outcome, but we will be seeking some public input either through FTAC or some other reaching out.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I concur with Kathy; you know, we have quarterly meetings to be transparent with the public, two a year with FTAC, two a year with the Navy working with the regulators on the public meetings, and as we progress forward, that would be a great topic.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah. In addition, the  there was a settlement, a consent order with the federal government, EPA, and the  the Navy and others, and there  on Thursday, they are going to be convening a  their first meeting of   This is a community outreach (inaudible).",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Community outreach and involvement, right. So that's also a good forum to talk about the reuse of the tanks.",0,B1,07/26/2023
I have a question for,0,B1,07/26/2023
"for the Department of Health. When you say you're gonna be the decision-maker, you really mean the governor, right? The governor or the legislature? You know, this is a political issue. I mean, I..know you're the technical agency, but when you say that, you're not the ultimate decision.",0,B1,07/26/2023
I would say we would have discussions with everyone about the,0,B1,07/26/2023
"But I  but I'm asking who makes the final decision. It's not DOH, right?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I used to be in DOH, so I",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I understand. I used to work for you when I was a DA, and you were the  you were my client when you were the director, so I understand you understand the political nature of this. So yes.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So that's why I asked the question because it's not that it's gonna be DOH dealing with the Department of Defense, which is kind of an unequal partnership, which I accept. I just wanted clarification is that I know politics will be involved, and ultimately, I think it's gonna be either the governor or  I hope the legislature doesn't get involved with this; it'll just complicate things, but it's more a comment than a question.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"But I think that's the value of transparency. If we  if the criteria are on the table and the analysis is supplied in an ethical and  and open way to each option, then everybody can see it. Somebody's gonna make that call who has the authority, but the consequences of the call will be clear, and there will be some accountability.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Well, I think both DOH and the Navy",0,B1,07/26/2023
In a perfect world.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. Will Congress have a  have a role in this, or is that gonna ultimately be DOD? Do you know, General Hashimoto?",0,B1,07/26/2023
Is Congress going to have a role?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Ma'am, I'll tell you, I'm unclear on that right now.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I think that will be one of the outcomes of the brief to Congress in February 2024, so we'll have to follow up on that at that point in time.",0,B1,07/26/2023
But this costs money that's not in a normal budget. Wouldn't that money be coming from Congress?,0,B1,07/26/2023
It all depends on if  are you Talking about what is the final solution or the recommendation for beneficial use?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Well, any solution would have to be funded.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Any solution  it may  it could be state, it could be DOD, it could be a corporation, so it would have to be funded. And so when we come down to that short list of options, that will have to be taken into consideration at that point in time. Because it might be a great option or recommendation, but if you can't get funded to  I'm making this up right now  to 2035, then maybe you might want to go with a different solution at that point in time, but that will be a future prize.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Well, I think the Navy is getting a real clear message. If you can kind of include this on your regular updates to us, you know, just the more transparency, the criteria that Neil is talking about, and process and substance. But I don't think  the intention isn't to have all of the answers today, but clearly, we are looking at sort of the bottom line, who makes the ultimate decision on this very important issue of the reuse of those facilities. Any other questions? Aurora.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah. I just have a second question for Mr. Hampton, which was if you could recap the three parallel efforts, nation",0,B1,07/26/2023
"That are happening. NDA, National Defense Authorization Act, ONR has funded UH  not (inaudible) for nonfossil fuel reuse, and then  and then this.",0,B1,07/26/2023
And then Nakupuna is the third.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Nakupuna. So given that  I guess having worked with the community, sometimes the perception can be that people's input will be considered in its full entirety, and the reality is that it will be  it would be weighted. Do  do people who are participating in these engagements understand that?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I think some more than others, ma'am.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I can say we've collected probably about a thousand just open surveys from the website. There was another about 40 interviews, and we're expecting another couple of thousand from the mail order coming in.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So you can have a wide range of recommendations there. And out of the wide range of recommendations, there  it's only going to come down to a short list of two, three, or four that ultimately get  have...  merit and are for strong consideration as the final product. So we consider everything, and this is why it was open for a wide range.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Not only did we get a lot of recommendations, but going back to criteria, saying  some people said we don't care what it is, as long as it has this criteria in there to make sure the environment is protected and the public (inaudible). So we're collecting all of this data and information; we're in the data collection phase right now, so as we synthesize all of this information and move forward, we will have better clarity on the next steps. But you're right, with all of these recommendations, it's gonna be a  99 percent of them won't  the recommendation won't be (inaudible), and it's gonna be narrowed down to a couple. And there are some, I'll say, recommendations that are consistent between multiple individuals making their submissions.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. So what is the process? We heard about the process for the selection will be based on certain criteria, but what's the process for shortlisting? Because there's a lot of stuff that can drop out, I bet.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Well, that's gonna go  all of this will be  okay. So the consolidated briefing is no",0,B1,07/26/2023
All of these three inputs are being fed back into D.C. Okay?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"D.C. will be consolidating  folks in D.C. will be consolidating this report later this year. They're working on criteria on how they're gonna approach that right now. I'm not involved in that at this point in time, but that's what they're gonna be doing to make the recommendations to the final brief to Congress in February '24.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Is there  and is the cri part of that process in D.C., or can it be? And I'm just asking because in, like, planning and participatory theory, there's rungs of engagement.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And consultation is sort of the lowest, and then, like, community decision-making is the highest, and the reality is it's gonna be somewhere in between. So is there  you know, in this  and it's really important for building trust to have more than that. So are you sort of engaging with those ideas of maybe shifting in order to build trust in the level of sort of community, say in at least that shortlisting?",0,B1,07/26/2023
So we do brief the community,0,B1,07/26/2023
in each and every open house we go to.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"As a matter of fact, we just came up with a new flier that is  I mentioned the mail survey going out at the end of this month; it's being targeted through zip codes throughout Oʻahu.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"We have a flier for that. We go to neighbor boards maybe two or three a week  two or three per week, and we're presenting this at the neighborhood boards.  And as Kathy just mentioned that we have this initiative kicking off this Thursday with the CRI, which is the community relations team, which will be a small group, okay, of people that are interested in Red Hill, which they'll be talking about the progress towards Red Hill overall being environmental tank closure plan and beneficial nonfuel reuse, and maybe be meeting twice per quarter in addition to all of the other public meetings, our public outreach. So there's a lot of opportunities we've had where we do go out and speak to the public about where we are in the process and the next steps.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Right. But still very one  one way.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"It's priority  I'll say it's priority right now, ma'am, because all of these three efforts are in the data-collection phase.",0,B1,07/26/2023
So until we get all of the data in,0,B1,07/26/2023
That will help us narrow down some of the criteria and the next steps and how to synthesize the data and represent it and present it. So it's almost like a Scattergory going on right now,0,B1,07/26/2023
"collecting all the data, and then which will inform  help formalize",0,B1,07/26/2023
how we  how it's consolidated and sorted.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah. I guess I'm thinking if  just as you move along, considering how much say  it's probably very different than how the Navy normally operates, but if the objective is to also build trust, then that feedback needs to come back. Because if you've taken a lot of people's time to get input",0,B1,07/26/2023
"and then don't take it into account, that actually puts you in a worse place afterwards because there's deeper cynicism.",0,B1,07/26/2023
So I think we'll have more clarity by the fall FTAC 2.,0,B1,07/26/2023
Which we will be presenting this final brief from Nakupuna of all of their results  and communicating some of the next steps that will follow on after that.,0,B1,07/26/2023
And so that's hopefully  that's one avenue.,0,B1,07/26/2023
But whatever we do at the FTAC,0,B1,07/26/2023
we have the same material that we use for community boards and other public meetings in addition to that.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"So people will see it in different places, yeah.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah. And all of this information I'm speaking of is currently with  in reference to Nakupuna, the survey results that we've received so far",0,B1,07/26/2023
who  the people that we interviewed one on one,0,B1,07/26/2023
"for the one on ones, that's all on the public-facing website right now through the QR code I showed you on the previous slide.",0,B1,07/26/2023
So all of this is out there available to the public today,0,B1,07/26/2023
for what's going on with this effort.,0,B1,07/26/2023
It does not elaborate on the other two efforts I told  spoke of,0,B1,07/26/2023
because those are independent until they get completed when we'll post the final information for those too.,0,B1,07/26/2023
And when the final report is publicized,0,B1,07/26/2023
"I guess after the brief to Congress, that will also be posted here too.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Okay. Thank you for explaining this. It does help.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay, thank you, ma'am.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yes, Neil, go ahead.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Well, it strikes me that this briefing of Congress is very important in terms of creating their impression of the status of the  of the issues and the background. Will you  is that an independent briefing? Is it the Navy telling its story to Congress, or will it be reflective of Department of Health and state interests?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So I'll have to get you more information on exactly who's gonna be presenting the brief itself, but it's gonna be input from those three independent efforts going on right now. So it's not gonna be the Navy's or a point of view; it's gonna be the collective point of view of all of the input we received and recommendations that we received regardless of the source of that.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So unless you're gonna have a representative team presenting to Congress, there probably should be a process to see what you're gonna say so that DOH and CWRM and other  Board of Water Supply can look at it and say, yeah, that's  you got it, that's what's going on here, so we all feel like Congress is being given an accurate viewof all the parties.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So are you  in other words  sorry, Chair Chang.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"No, go ahead, Kathy.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"In other words, are you suggesting that they  that they present us the findings prior to the reports so we would have comment on it. Is that the",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I'm not sure who will summon  how this briefing occurs, whether it  you know, anybody can jump on the agenda or  but if we're not on the agenda, if it's just the Navy, then I think some prior  before that occurs, some prior discussion with these parties, the stakeholders, would be healthy  if not required, it would at least be healthy and transparent so that we know  understand, yeah, you've got our position accurately captured.  Okay, sir. I'll write that down as an action item for myself. I don't think  I don't have an answer for that right now. I  honestly, I don't think the brief to Congress is gonna be released intact before it goes to Congress, okay, but I think discussions could probably take place prior to that.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"General Hashimoto, I think we agreed on, like, quarterly updates, so this is July, I think the next update would be very close to your  I guess it's October. October, July  yeah",0,B1,07/26/2023
"We'll come back with whatever frequency you require, Chair Chang.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay, yeah. I think we were looking at quarterly updates, so maybe the next one would be back in October, and hopefully, you'll have some greater updates. I was also hoping—you know, I think you're getting sort of an inclination from this commission about the desire to be transparent. I have greatly appreciated the updates you've provided us, sort of the candor in your process. It is so much better when you say—if you don't know, don't—you know, don't make something, but that you'll come back to us. So, again, we hope—you know, please come back to us But in the desire for transparency, I am hoping that after the report on your findings in the outreach, that report is broadly distributed to everyone who participated and more so that they have an opportunity to provide you comments on the report as well. I think, you know, in the past, we have had other very important issues where we've had minority reports that go up that the report is, you know, reflects the authors, and it may be a majority report. There may be something—there's an opportunity for someone who—a group or, you know, entities who disagree to submit at least—at least where there's additional comments or a minority report. But please think about that as a way to continue ongoing Transparency as providing us another opportunity  us being the community, another opportunity to weigh in on the report that it does reflect the community's both process and substance.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yes, ma'am. And Chair Chang, what I  what I can promise you is when Nakupuna's report is final",0,B1,07/26/2023
"we'll have a press release announcing that it's final, along with the website where it's publicly posted. Also, there will be an email address. If anybody has any request for information or would like clarity or follow up any point, I will take all those in  all those requests, and I will respond to them. And all the responses to anybody's questions, I will also post on the public website for everybody's information. So I can",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Since I'm new to this process, this kind of briefing, where else have you been giving this to? The reason I ask is that the questions from the commissioners are like  we want to be able to disseminate the information to as many people as possible, but what I want to know is, is this commission the proper one or the one...-",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I'll take that. There have been multiple venues where this team has presented information. You've already heard about the FTAC; that's pretty well-known. There's the House Special Committee on Red Hill, there's a Governor's Commission on Water, and there's also defueling  a specific defueling information-sharing forum as well as the ability to interact at any time.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. I appreciate that because my impression was the questions were being asked by the commissioners as  like you guys gotta go out there and do more. I just want to know if this is the main forum, or do you have many forums?",0,B1,07/26/2023
I would say it's one of many that is attended by many of the commissioners here that have been ongoing.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"I can respond, though. I mean, part of the feedback that we've gotten loud and clear and regularly from the public",0,B1,07/26/2023
Can you  I have a hard time understanding what you're saying.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah, yeah. I have small kids who have germs, so the feedback that we have gotten from the public from day one has been that the commission's regular open meetings have provided an important forum for exchange and questions at a time that there wasn't all of this public kind of facing organized communication. So we still get, you know, sort of that push from those who provide testimony to  to ensure that transparency happens. So it's good that it's happening through other forums now and with more regularity.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And Larry, if I can just add to Aurora's comments, there was really  I mean, I have  since I've come on board as chair tried to use both the water commission and the land board as an opportunity for a public forum because we are one of the few agencies that actually open our meetings to the public. It was designed to create a safe space for informed decision-making, permitting, you know, issues before they are controversial, including the Navy, an opportunity. And General Hashimoto has been extremely cooperative and willing to do that, so it is  and we've asked for a comprehensive update, not just on defueling, but on all of the aspects So I think the intention for CWRM was while some of these things may be out of our regulatory lane, it is nonetheless a public platform that the community can look both at our minutes, can review our transcripts, and can all participate in our process through either YouTubing or coming and providing comment. So that's kind of the  you know, the impetus of this. But I do know that the Navy has been having numerous meetings. I did  you know, I don't know how coordinated everyone is, but this has been just our platform to create another space for good information before decisions are being made.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. I'm glad about that clarification because what I'm looking at is that we are the water commission, and my focus is on water issues.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And so I don't want to get into wide-ranging things where we're  we're basically looking at stuff that we shouldn't be looking at. But as long as they want to be  are willing to provide information to us, and as long as some of the commissioners think it's important that we be the conduit for the public, I'm fine with that.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"But I want to remind everybody that we're the water commission, okay?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah. No, appreciate that reminder, Larry. I mean  and I think that the commission is clear what our role is, but I think we also  many, many members of the commission hear public comments, and General Hashimoto",0,B1,07/26/2023
"His team have been willing to utilize our meeting as an opportunity for good, accurate, current information on a regular basis. Also, I think I'd be remiss if I didn't add the open houses these organizations hold, as well as using the City and County's neighborhood board system to get the information out. And I would like to say as valuable as it has been for us to be able to push information to the public and the commission via this meeting, I can speak for everyone here today; the insights that we have gained from your comments have been invaluable. And so making sure we meet accuracy and completion standards, we wouldn't have that kind of interaction, so mahalo for your input.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay, great. Any other questions? And General Hashimoto, do you have more presentations?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Oh, absolutely, Chair. I'd like to turn it over to Ms. Sarah Moody to continue information about the remediation efforts.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Good morning. My name is Sarah Moody. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. I work for Naval Facilities Engineering Command Hawai‘i overseeing the Red Hill environmental work that we're doing in regard to... I would like to speak to you today about water quality and efforts the Navy continues to ensure our water quality for our distribution system and to protect, monitor, and make sure that we're doing everything we can to ensure we have safe drinking water. Currently, we are in Period 6 of a seven-period commitment that the Navy made in March of 2022 to collect 7800 drinking water samples from the distribution system for the purpose of identifying clean water in locations, ensuring that the recovery we had done following the water crisis in November of 2021 had sustained and that we had no ongoing issues in the water system. This effort also aims to build public confidence in the drinking water system by creating an avenue for consistently collecting data, posting it publicly, and interacting with residents in the community to demonstrate that the drinking water is safe. So far, we have collected 6300 samples of drinking water from residents and facilities throughout the distribution system. We also have several locations where we continue to collect samples on a periodic basis, such as all of our schools, child development facilities, medical facilities, and any other high-risk locations. We do this with the purpose of ensuring that we are showing that the water is safe. especially for communities with at-risk populations such as our keiki. So all of that data is posted online, and it continues to be shared. We continue to see that the water remains safe to drink. We have not had a detection of JP5, of jet fuel, since we began the long-term monitoring program, and we continue to look at those results. If we identify any concern, such as an exceedance like lead, it is immediately dealt with. The family is provided bottled water, or the school or whatever of that nature, and we do the process to remediate and close out that exceedance. In addition to long-term monitoring and the monitoring we're doing for total petroleum hydrocarbons or fuel, we have also sampled our Waiawa Shaft, our primary source, which is our sole source right now for the drinking water system, for PFAS to guarantee that we don't have PFAS in our drinking water and to guarantee that's not an area of concern for our drinking water constituents. That result was non-detect. We were able to verify that the drinking water is non-detect for PFAS. We also continue to make sure we're sharing our data in a variety of avenues. We've created a website called Safe Waters, which is a sharing website that the Navy has utilized to make available the data to all members of our community. So we are able to share the data in We have data for courts or files, so the actual laboratory reports from the files shared in the library. We have data summary reports at the end of each period to be able to attempt to better explain the data that residents in the community are looking at, help them explain what that means to them and how it's relevant. We also have an interactive map which allows residents or business owners, or community members to look up an address and be able to see the data history from that specific location. Some of the feedback we've heard specifically is to make things like school names easy to search so that a parent with a student in a school can easily look up that school name and identify what the safety of the water at their child's school is and things of that nature. In addition to these efforts, we also wanted to continue to promote public outreach and community outreach. We've been setting up booths in places like the Naval Exchange facility in the lobby area, which is open to the public for people to interact with drinking water experts, look up their results, ask questions, and find out more information about the work we're doing. We are also working with our schools, hoping this fall to set up those similar booths at maybe some back-to-school events or open houses so that parents of students can help feel confidence In the drinking water for their children  can interact and ask questions and get information about the water. So those are just some of the efforts that we're doing to continue to show the water is safe and to also basically hold to our commitment that we were going to continue to sample the water. In addition to all of the efforts we're doing here, we continue to pursue sampling at the Navy Aiea Hālawa Shaft. It is our current shaft that is offline; it's been offline since December 3rd of 2021; however, we felt it was important to build data history for that location. And so starting in September of 2022, we began doing every two to three weeks a flushing to over land for about 15 to 20 minutes for the purpose of collecting samples from that location to build data history so that we could see what the water quality is like in that location for future discussions with our regulators about reuse of that location. So that's just some of the things we're doing in regards to our drinking water, and Captain Sullivan will share more about our remediation efforts and other environmental",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And if I could also, on this same topic that we do have  as Sarah mentioned, all of the testing going on, we also have a rapid response team that is available. If any resident has a concern about their water quality, if they're seeing anything unusual, they can call.over to our Emergency Operations Center, and then we'll dispatch a team to go look at the quality as well as take samples for an initial sample, and then we'll add them to make sure their location gets included within the period within the next few days for the long-term monitoring so that we can get those results. So that remains (inaudible).",0,B1,07/26/2023
These  these are your tactics. What indicators are you using to determine whether your tactics are successful so that the public feels a sense of high confidence in drinking that water?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"So that's a  that's a challenging data point to track. Obviously, we continue to take feedback from the community. If they're drinking bottled water, if they're not using their water, is that something where we can have conversations, actually go into their home and look at the water in their home and see if there's a specific issue that can be addressed. We have seen a distinct down-shift in reports and calls of concerns and things like that over the last six months or so, and so we hope that's indicative that people are starting to have confidence in their water again. But the challenge with public trust is that's a hard thing to quantify, and so all we can continue to do is act to show, sustain that we continue to hold to our word.the best reports and the gauge I have is my interactions with the community.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And if I could add to that, at a lot of these town hall events and our booths at different locations, we will have individuals to come up very concerned, very emotional at times, and take the time to walk through. We explain the results, we answer all the questions, and most of those interactions do leave with that individual feeling like they got their questions answered and at least understanding it. You know, sometimes  sometimes we can't pull back and restore that full trust, but we at least  by the mood, by the way those interactions go, and what might start as a very tense interaction, we do our best and receive indications that when that individual finally does leave the table, the booth, or the discussion, they seem to be satisfied and understanding at least of what we're doing (inaudible).",0,B1,07/26/2023
"As imperfect as any measure might be, I think making an effort to just kind of identify some things that you're tracking and seeing the delta over time I think would be beneficial.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Yeah. So with what frequency are you  this is the questions we get. So with what frequency is the Navy testing for PFAS?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"So currently, we have tested the WaiawaShaft a single time under the UCMR5, the basically unregulated contaminates program under the EPA. And so we will collect another sample this fall, seven months after that sample, to verify that. We do not currently sample for PFAS within the distribution system just because of the sensitivity of that testing procedure and the risk of cross-contamination because PFAS is so prevalent in all sorts of things in our community, in popcorn packaging and Teflon pans and things like that. So we've prioritized those efforts on the sources; both the Navy Aiea Hālawā Shaft has been tested as well as the Waiāwa Shaft.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I have a follow-up, then. So by that token, are you using EPA  what is it? Method  what methods are being used?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Sorry. So there are two separate method groups for PFAS. We  for the Waiāwa Shaft and the Navy Aiea Hālawā Shaft, we use Method 537.1 and 533, which are the EPA drinking water methods. For other PFAS efforts that we've done in the area, such as following the AFFF release or at the Red Hill Shaft, we have used Method 1633, which is the method that's been identified for environmental sampling",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And to follow on to Kathy's question for the PFAS sampling, we do continue to monitor and sample for the groundwater monitoring wells in the vicinity of the AFFF release in November of '22. So those are collected. It was weekly for the first six months after the release, and it is now two-monthly testing of those monitor wells in that vicinity for PFAS.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Oh, sorry. I asked because we know that those methods are limited to a certain set of known and regulated  or not regulated, but, like, you know, a subset of the possible substances that can occur. And so I guess, are you considering  maybe that's a silly question, but, you know, are there other methods that are coming online that are not regulatory or not, I guess EPA approved yet, such as AOF or TOF that really look at, like, the full  you know, you might have a contaminant event, and then it breaks down into other compounds that are still potentially harmful, but  I  and I'm saying this for the public too, like that our knowledge of how to regulate and monitor PFAS is evolving, but what are you guys doing to think about how to protect public health given the potential for contamination?",0,B1,07/26/2023
Absolutely. So we continue to work with the regulators to sample whatever methods are kind ofpreferred and asked of us from the regulators. 1633 did extend to 40 different PFAS analytes.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"So it is a more extensive, comprehensive look; it has lower detection levels. 537.1 and 533 combined give us a pretty complete picture of the primary group of PFAS, so  and also to  under long-term monitoring, we're collecting for 60-plus analytes of all sorts of other constituents such as volatile organic compounds and semi-volatile organic compounds and anything related to total petroleum hydrocarbons. So we are already doing a pretty comprehensive sampling program; this is just adding those 40 PFAS constituents in addition to that sampling.",0,B1,07/26/2023
And that (inaudible) of Waiapo will be moving forward,0,B1,07/26/2023
So  so Waiapo is sampled every period. Our sources are sampled at the beginning of every period of long-term monitoring. So we do a threat  so there are seven periods in the plan.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"So we do a  kind of a baseline sample to make sure we're re-verifying that our source water is meeting safe drinking water standards, and then we move forward through that period. So we continue to sample the Waiawa Shaft, and we're committed throughout the defueling process to be mindful of public trust in the community and needed to take a sample from Waiwa Shaft to continue to verify to the public that the water remains safe to drink because that location is six miles from Red Hill.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Okay. Any other questions?  (No response.),0,B1,07/26/2023
Thank you so much.,0,B1,07/26/2023
Do you have  go ahead.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Go on to the next slide, please.  So my name is Captain James Sullivan, and I'm the commanding officer of Naval Facilities System Engineering Command Hawai‘i. I got an opportunity, I thank you for the opportunity last fall to also brief the commission, and the slide you're looking at now is actually one of the  the results of that discussion and not just with  with CWRM, but also discussions I've had with Ernie Lau and many other key stakeholders, and that is to make sure that we have a very clear and transparent plan that's laid out so that you see all the activities that we're doing. It's updated and posted on our website, and you are able to hold us accountable just as we hold ourselves accountable for all of the actions that we're proceeding. So while this focus is on the current remediation And recovery efforts that are going on, we also have  and the Navy is committed to the long-term remediation of the site. Long after defueling, long after closure, we know that we have that responsibility to remediate that site, and those steps are beginning right now with some of the site assessments that are looking at the site in its entirety and all contaminants that may exist so that we can have a plan for what our remediation efforts may be for many, many years. In everything that we do, you know, my team is working directly with the DOH, the EPA, BWS, CWRM, USGS, and UH. Since last fall, there have been a lot of additional forums. As the general mentioned, we're briefing at whether it be the Governor's Water Committee, but we've also started  there's SME roundtables that are conducted at both the senior level as well as the working level with the SMEs where we're pulling in folks from your team, folks from Board of Water Supply and USGS, University of Hawai‘i, all to sit down and talk about are our tactics working? Are there new issues arising, or do we need to change something that we're doing right now? As well as receive any feedback that they might be receiving from their constituents. We also meet with Ernie Lau on a very regular basis. I know that there are sometimes we don't see eye to eye on an issue, but we definitely talk it out and make sure we're hearing his perspective so that it could influence our  our decision and our way forward. So while I don't intend to go into great detail into everything on this slide  again, this is what is posted on our website, and this is the  really, the tool that I utilize every time I'm briefing on one of these major forums, but I did want to call out a few key efforts that I know have been part of the decisions within this committee in the past and are very important to our continued success in the remediation of Red Hill. So moving down to the first section is the Monitoring and Sampling Effort, that first blue and the bars below it. Those are all related to our continued sampling to make sure we know what's going on in the soil but also below the soil all around Red Hill. The key area there is the monitoring well expansion. We've committed to 22 additional monitoring wells this year. We're making great progress on that. We've already got ten complete; there are four in progress, still have eight remaining. We also  on that effort, there will be another discussion in October with all of those SMEs again, members from this commission, but also with DOH, EPA, and Board of Water Supply to talk about monitoring well locations that we currently are not proceeding with. Do we need to adjust where we're putting those to make sure we fully understand what the water underneath in the aquifer is doing?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Captain, excuse me. Oh, Captain, could you  sorry. What's an SME? I'm not familiar.",0,B1,07/26/2023
A subject matter expert.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay, okay. Thank you.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"No. Sorry, sorry, sorry.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So one of  while it's much lower on the slide deck here, but what are we utilizing the data that we are getting for the monitoring wells? It is to also make sure and conduct modeling. So there are two parallel modeling efforts that we're proceeding with. We have both the Navy modeling effort where we're working with one of our contractors and have been for several years, and then there is an independent University of Hawai‘i modeling effort that we are supporting, giving them  make sure they have all of our data, any access, and helping them in any way we can, but that is a parallel modeling effort the University of Hawai‘i is doing to, again, make sure we understand what's happening below the surface, where is the groundwater flowing. Another item I would like to talk about is, you know, we mentioned  I think at the last CWRM there was some discussion on what are your current actions. The soil vapor extraction is a technology that we are proceeding with right Now. So where we're getting the tunnel and the Adit close to where the November 20 release occurred and close to the Red Hill Shaft, preparing, getting the holes that we need and the equipment that we need to do the soil vapor extraction, where this is basically we're pushing air  we've identified locations from below the surface of the tunnel all the way to the top of the aquifer where we believe there may be fuel that's trapped within those layers to where we will be pushing in air and pulling back air, out air, sucking that air out to try to pull all of that fuel that might remain anywhere trapped within the soil. So that effort is currently in progress. We're getting the equipment ready; we're getting everything we need ready to proceed with that. We also have to be very careful that none of the efforts that we're doing now, we're not gonna do anything that could in any way slow down or impact the defueling operations. So it is a little bit  there are some pauses at times, and there's a lot of working with the DOH where we know a lot of people on their team that would be reviewing and are working with this, on these plans, are also the same reviewers that are working on all of the defueling. So a little bit of patience, not moving as quickly as we would like, but still an effort that we are fully pushing forward with. Yes.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Oh, okay. A quick one.u're on monitoring. So is the data from these new monitoring wells on the groundwater sampling?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And so one thing of note, just like Sarah had talked about the Safe Waters website where we have interactive maps, all of the results are posted. We have developed a parallel site which is focused  we have one on drinking water, our distribution system, and then we have developed a similar site on all of the environmental groundwater samples, any soil samples, and that’s  and that’s where this remediation table is all on the environmental app. We have an interactive map on that one as well where you can click on any monitoring well that’s in the network, and you can find out what the results were for that monitoring well, but we also have all of the full detailed lab reports and everything posted on that site as well And that was one of the things that we worked very closely with Ernie Lau and the team to make sure he had access to all of the results and everything that was required of us, and we continue to every day improve the quality of that site and the user-friendliness of it.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Captain, with regard to this Monitoring and sampling, you're continuing to run the pumps and put the water into Wahiawa Stream, and there's been public concern about the effects of that water on the surface  the surface water system itself as well as the life that's dependent upon it. Is that captured in the monitoring?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"It's in  in the monitoring, but also one of the efforts that we  that I was gonna talk about here in just a moment was halfway down the slide under the Adit 3 Remediation Efforts. The first and second bullet talk about the capture zone that we're maintaining within the Red Hill Shaft where we're pulling any contamination that might be in the aquifer towards the pumps so that we can collect them. If you go back to in the months following the release, you know, December all the way through the spring of '22, we recovered several hundred gallons of fuel off of the surface through the skimming operations and everything that was required. We've continued to maintain that capture zone, and we're to the point now where we're pulling about a teaspoon every 30 days off of the surface. So very, very little in quantity, but we are maintaining and pulling any contamination. But we did start a pilot study in working with all the subject matter experts to  we developed a pilot study to try to reduce the pumping to the least amount required to maintain that capture zone. So on the 20th of June, we..d that pilot study. We have resumed up to the pumping rate we were at before, about 4.3 million gallons a day. We're gathering all the data, putting it all together, and then we're gonna be sitting down again with that same group of subject matter experts to verify did we maintain the capture zone effectively and can we permanently reduce our pumping down to that 1.8 million gallons a day average. On a parallel effort to the reducing the capture zone  or reducing the pumpage required at the capture zone, we have been proceeding with  there's a military construction project, an effort for a water treatment facility that we will be installing at Red Hill. So that design has been proceeding, the design will be complete this fall. Obviously, there's still the Congressional approvals required to make sure that that military construction project is fully funded before it is awarded, but we are moving very quickly to make sure that we have that water treatment facility ready to go. Again, knowing that we do not want to forever",0,B1,07/26/2023
my simple mind understands this. So the Board of Water Supply cuts off their pumps so that you're the only draw in that aquifer.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"So all of this is coming toetting a teaspoon out a month. And then that draw then has to be  exit the system, so it goes into Wahiawa Stream after you've taken the teaspoonful out and you're monitoring that there's no more in there that's causing damage to the  the riparian?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So the  within the capture zone within the Red Hill Shaft, we are pulling and skimming from the surface of the water. The pump is pulling from 18 foot below the surface of the water to where we are testing the water quality there. We are running it through granular activated carbon treatment to strip out any TPH-related components that could exist, and then we are again testing the water at the effluent side of those GAC treatments before it is going into the Wahiawa Stream. So it's being tested prior to as well as at the exterior, and we are not pulling from the surface; we are pulling from 18 foot below.",0,B1,07/26/2023
And those tests are indicating no problem?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Correct. Those  yeah, there is not  there is no TPH that is being released into the environment at all.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Okay. Any other questions?  (No response.),0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah, pending any questions, I know that there's a lot of detail to give. This is why we will always keep this updated on our website, and this is the tool that we're gonna utilize any time that I'm briefing, whether  it doesn't matter what the forum is, this is  this is what we will utilize to make sure that that whole transparency is out there and we continue to move forward in it.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Excuse me, Chair. This is Wayne Katayama.",0,B1,07/26/2023
May I ask a question?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Captain Sullivan, maybe you could help me with the eight remaining monitoring wells. What is your ETA on putting those online?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Our goal for all of those eight remaining is to get them complete by the end of the calendar year, but we have run into substantial issues with some of the private landowners that are in the area that are  that are not interested in us drilling a well within their area. So we continue  again, Board of Water Supply has been very helpful in helping us to maybe encourage or to work through some of the permitting requirements. Obviously, we have to follow all of the Section 106 and following all of the rules, but that's what some of our challenges have been. So I can't say that we are  we are still tracking and pushing hard to complete all 22 by the end of the calendar year, but we have some major challenges still to get through when it comes to some of especially those  those land agreements that are required.",0,B1,07/26/2023
So the calendar year is FY '24?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"I'm sorry. What was that, sir?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Is your calendar year FY '24, or are you looking at December?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah, it would be into the beginning of fiscal year '24, end of calendar year '23. So by December of '23 is when we would like to have all 22 in place, but we are a little bit behind schedule due to those land issues right now.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Oh, thank you, Captain. And I guess this is for maybe either you or Sarah. You know, you've talked about long-term monitoring; what organization will be in place to carry out the monitoring requirements that you're presently on, or is that gonna be different?",0,B1,07/26/2023
'Cause you have quite a few resources right now,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yes, sir, so  so as the  I'm the commanding officer of NAVFAC Hawai‘i, and NAVFAC Hawai‘i will maintain the responsibility of proceeding with the long-term monitoring that exists currently as well as any additional follow-on monitoring that may be required. That would all fall within my organization, sir.",0,B1,07/26/2023
And have the resources been identified and funded?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"They have. The individuals, as well as the resources, at least for the next couple of fiscal years, are already in place or are being put in place.",0,B1,07/26/2023
So the funding right now is not a concern that I have.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Great. Thank you very much, Captain.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And Captain, this is Dawn. I just have a question about monitoring. I know that in response to Commissioner Hannahs  are you also monitoring down in any of the stream outflow by Pearl Harbor and its impacts to aquatic resources, marine resources?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yes, ma'am. So one of the  following the emergency order, there is a team from the University of Hawai‘i that does ecological monitoring down in the HālavaStream to ensure that we're not impacting any wildlife or causing any issues, and so that's been ongoing, and we haven't seen any significant issue from that water coming from the GACs. So because it is clean water, it's being tested; we haven't seen any impacts to the Hālawa Stream as it's entering Pearl Harbor.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay, thanks. That's really helpful. So at least we've got some baseline to have some ongoing monitoring to look in the future whether there's any change. Okay, thank you for confirming that. Any other questions? I note it's almost 10:30. General Hashimoto  oh, go ahead, Aurora.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Sorry, I'm keeping people from a coffee break. So I just wanted to add, I think Ayron was working with that effort as I  is that correct, Deputy Manuel, that Ayron Strauch is working with the UH team",0,B1,07/26/2023
I will defer to Dr. Strauch.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"But kind of answering that, we've set up kind of a monitoring program with the University of Hawai‘i to be the lead on biological monitoring of Hālawa Stream, and then our staff coordinates and/or, you know, talk to the University of Hawai‘i with that research that's done. And we  we had them present, I think It was maybe six months ago, on the findings or if there were any significant findings, and they didn't find any impact at this time. But we can make the request maybe at the next quarterly to maybe do an update more formally on the Hālawā Stream biological monitoring if that's possible.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So I do have a question, and this is for Captain Sullivan or Ms. Moody. We've talked a lot about monitoring but remediation at specific sites, but I think I'm curious because I think there's a way that the public understands the word ""remediation"" and the way that agencies use the term remediation. How do you define it under standard remediation? And then who is responsible not for Adit 3 or Adit 6 but aquifer cleanup if there is contamination? And maybe that's also between DOH. So I'm not sure who to direct the question to, but maybe we can start here.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So, part of our efforts is looking at Red Hill holistically, right? It is not just a situation at Adit 3 or a —",0,B1,07/26/2023
— situation at Adit 6.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"But because we are actively defueling right now, the goal right now is to pursue site assessment planning, which will be the comprehensive look at the entire The facility, all of Red Hill, will identify any historical events that may have occurred at Red Hill that we're not currently actively pursuing. We will begin the process of active remediation or exploration as needed once we don't have fuel in the hill. Right now, that risk is not really worth starting to drill and explore; the priority is defueling. As we move forward, we will look at Red Hill as a holistic site and identify what site remediation needs to occur. This is a long-term effort. The Navy is committed to the environmental restoration of Red Hill in the long term, so we anticipate a complete, comprehensive site assessment that could take several years. Remedial project management work will be occurring with project engineers who are down in the details, looking at aerial view footage of the facility as a whole, pulling up historical data from the archives, and identifying anything that could have potentially been located or a certain piece of equipment. Do we need to pull soil from this location or things of that nature? Right now, we have very active efforts at Adit 3 because of the events in 2021, and we have specific efforts at Adit 6 following the AFFF events. Right now, monitoring is the key goal through defueling to make sure nothing has changed in the landscape, and then we'll pursue the active remediation portion and site assessment.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And that would be for both land and water, right?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So there's two separate and distinct studies that are gonna be done or remediation that's gonna be done, one for land and one for the aquifer. Okay. And so how does that  that's not on this timeline, but at some point, it overlaps with the first timeline and",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Right, if  yeah, it will continue",0,B1,07/26/2023
"long, long after the bars on this timeline come and go. I mean, it will be ten-plus years of",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And it would be an effort between the regulator  the regulators, in this case, would be the Department of Health and the EPA reviewing the plans and getting input from the public on the remediation efforts.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. But as a water person, I'm wondering how does the aquifer work? Because you know, when you're cleaning up soil, it stays in place.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Not necessarily, but yeah.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Right, no, not necessarily, but, you know, it's a little bit more straightforward. You scrape up the dirty soil, you move it offsite and put it anyways. But how does aquifer remediation proceed, or are you waiting for the groundwater monitoring modeling studies? You know, like",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah, I think  I mean, I think it's a combination. We have to do the modeling to see where it's moving, but also, like Sarah had said, it really is  we really do need to, in earnest, wait until it's defueled because we want to make sure that there are studies that are being done, but if there is a drop that enters the environment in any way as a result of the defueling effort, we’re gonna have to analyze that as well.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And we're very sensitive to any penetrations, any pathways that we could create",0,B1,07/26/2023
if there were an event to sort of,0,B1,07/26/2023
"And one of our primary efforts during defueling is groundwater protection efforts, so increased monitoring of the aquifer, of the soil vapor to be able tquickly identify if anything changes. 'Cause that's the beauty of having these extended periods of data is you can see changes in the data trends and then act quickly and accordingly to make sure we're taking the most protective stance possible (inaudible).",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. I guess I just have a little bit of trouble seeing  like we had a contamination event, it moved, it appears to not be as much of a problem anymore. It would be great to see the data that showed that if you have the data and if it is visualized. I know we can dig it up and look at it under tables, but then  and there's a system in place to do a rapid response if something bad happens during defueling, but I guess, like, it's  to me, it seems more important to have like a really tight monitoring system in place because the way model building works is like you need data to  to validate your model, so you have to have your monitoring network and, like, it has to be high frequency, and then you can build the model. But the model is only gonna tell you something useful in the future if you have a release again, which we hopefully won't",0,B1,07/26/2023
if we're defueling. So I'm just trying to piece together what  the logic of all of it.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"So there  we have DOH, EPA, and the University of Hawai‘i has a team that is trying to understand the modeling efforts.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Now, currently, there are still inputs that need to be placed in to complete the model.",0,B1,07/26/2023
And you also have 37 monitoring well location inputs right now.,0,B1,07/26/2023
So we are actively monitoring those locations in addition to pursuing new locations.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"I think this is great. I think there's a lot of conversations here. Everybody's working really hard. If there is a good opportunity for that information to sort of be packaged into something digestible so that the public can understand and  I mean, I am a member of the public. I have an advanced degree, and I really struggle with it. Like if we can understand the roles that everybody's playing on this more  not looking up so much at what's happened, but how we're, you know, sort of building better responsiveness or awareness of what's in the aquifer.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And I believe one of our big One of our efforts has been to improve the environmental side of our website to make it as clear as possible. So I'm not sure how familiar you are with the interactive maps we put in place as well as e-maps. So those discussions are occurring, and we're taking the recommendations from Kathy Ho and her team as well as Ernie and trying to incorporate and do just what you said, make it very easy to understand what's going on. It is a complex issue to where it's not easy to understand.",0,B1,07/26/2023
But that's what the intent of that environmental half of the website is.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay, that's good. I mean, if I can request like maybe  if it's ready for a public-facing presentation at the next meeting, I think that would be very helpful because, yeah, like Dr. Miike said, we're focused on the water.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Ma'am, I'd also like to add just a little snippet here. I know people heard there's a lot of websites out there, and you're trying to say, okay, which website's for what.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Right? That QR code that I showed you in the tank closure graphic.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay? You go there to that main website; you scroll to the bottom, and all of these other websites you heard about are listed right there at the bottom of that main page.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Safe Waters, you go to the QR code and scroll down, all  it's one-stop shopping there.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And you can go down and go to the Safe Waters and all of these other websites you heard through those links right there, so you don't have to remember six or seven different websites.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. Any other questions or comments before - General Hashimoto, do you  do you have additional presentation, or does this close your presentation?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Chair Chang, that concludes our slides. We want to say a big mahalo to everyone, the commissioners, for the opportunity to present this information about what we have been doing, what we are doing, what we plan on doing, and some things we really have to look forward to. Again, the big one, going back to Jason's initial presentation, is the start of the gravity train in mid-October for scheduled completion in January, which for historians of this crisis know that that will represent at least a year's worth of condensing of the timeframe for the safe and expeditious defueling of Red Hill, you know, which is about  it's not about the water itself, but it's about the removal of the threat to the aquifer. So really appreciate this opportunity. We greatly look forward to our next time showing up here in front of the commission, and we've got the things that we'll bring back the next time we're able to get together.  Very good. Thank you, General Hashimoto and the team. Commissioners, do you have any final questions before I let the Navy team step down?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I will just say even your characterization in your summary, it's not just what you're doing, it's the impact and  of those actions. It's like  you can tell me what phase you're in, but I want to know what the score is.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"The true art and science of this effort, that's the big takeaway.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah, its impact, whether it's working.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. Ready? Okay. And I do, on behalf of the water commission and at least the public that participates in our process, thank you very much, General Hashimoto, to you and your team. I think we have felt  at least I have felt this increased level of confidence in this joint task force and the transparency. But, you know, every time you let your guard down, all it takes is one, so, again, mahalo to your continued commitment and your commitment to us to provide us updates. So I'm gonna  we're gonna move the Navy off, and then we're gonna open it up for public comments, but I'm gonna take a ten-minute break. We'll come back at 10:45. All right, everyone? Thank you very much.(10:33 a.m.-10:50 a.m.)",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I'm gonna call the meeting back to order. And now  thank you again to the Navy for the presentation. I'm now gonna take public comments. So we have received written testimony. Are  is there anybody in the room? I'm gonna go first there. Anybody in the room? Okay. The woman in the back, why don't you come up to the table and identify your name.",0,B1,07/26/2023
You have three minutes.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"You'll have  yep, you'll have three minutes.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And if you've submitted written testimony, know that we've reviewed your written testimony as well. Thank you.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. Thank you for allowing me to testify. I'm Susan Gorman-Chang with Shut Down Red Hill Coalition. First, I want to comment about the Navy. You know, there's an imbalance of power going on here. The Navy's presumption is they really are gonna have the final say; that's what I'm hearing. You know, when they say, We'll let you know after the briefing is written, and we'll share with you, and we'll take your comment; that is different than working alongside us, and so the  the empower  the balance in power is not right. It is our water, not the Navy's water.  Okay. So first and foremost, I wonder if you have all read this from the Department of Health, Exposure Assessment, November 2021, ""Release of Jet 5 Jet Fuel Into theJoint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam Drinking Water System"" by Dr. Roger Brewer. Has the Navy, the commission read this?",0,B1,07/26/2023
I'll admit not in its full entirety.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Oh, okay. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you so much.  And I think the report shows that jet fuel is not the only thing that should be tested. The report and presentation reveal level  the levels and seriousness of exposure that families endured regarding several chemicals in addition to JP5, and they continue to experience. To me, it is evidence of the US Navy's mishandling and lack of ability, lack of supervision of their contractors, lack of emergency preparedness to deal in any way with the November 2021 jet fuel, deicing agent, and solvents and other chemicals that were leaked into the drinking water system and ingested and inhaled by countless military and civilian households. I think the latest evidence and analysis shows without a doubt that the US Navy cannot be trusted to manage any water system without strong and continual oversight by the commissions. The most recent TFA leaks is further evidence of this mismanagement. Commissioners, this happened on your watch and continues to evolve and unfold on your watch. Commissioners, you are not the helpless orchestra that played as the Titanic sank. You have responsibility and power. You have access to our lifeboats which in this case is safeguarding our water.",0,B1,07/26/2023
I'm gonna ask you to summarize. I'm sorry. Go ahead and summarize.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay, I just have some more requests. I'd like you  we'd like you to have a meeting every month; it would be nice if the Navy were here every month and to have Red Hill an action item. Ask the Department of Health to update their environmental action levels to protect all water drinkers. Do not give the Navy any more permission for any more water. Decrease the Navy's water by 20 percent or whatever the imbalance of those shafts that they're not gonna be reopened. And consider pursuing a lawsuit jointly with Board of Water Supply against the corporations that created the forever chemicals, PFAs, so the creators of the chemicals must pay for remediation to take PFAs out of the water. This has just last month been successfully accomplished to the tune of a one billion dollars agreement by Chemours, DuPont and Corteva, who agreed to provide more than one billion dollars to municipalities and water",0,B1,07/26/2023
"I'm going to ask you to  this has been four minutes. But we've also received your written testimony, so thank you very much.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Okay. Thank you very much.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Thank you. Thank you very much  the gentleman, why don't you come on up and identify yourself, please?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Hello, I'm Matt Garrick, a member of the public living in Mānoa, and I really appreciate the commission for having these public meetings, for allowing public testimony, and for your  time and consideration of this matter in looking into it. In one part of the meeting, I  I heard a concern whether this is relevant, and we were on the slide that was talking about the repurposing of Red Hill and whether that's relevant for this commission. And I just want to ask, don't you think that given the tanks are located in or on  right above the aquifer, depending on who you ask, that any repurposing of these tanks would have a relevant impact on our water, potentially permanent impact on our water. So I hope you consider that. The other thing I noticed from the presentation was that I didn't see anything about ag land, and it's been known that these PFAS allow these chemicals that are being polluted into the water can be taken into fish, can be taken into plants, move up the food chain, entering into our bodies. I was recently  someone recently reached out to me who lives on ag land in Aiea, and they said the military came, asked to make sure that no one was drinking any of the water that's being pumped into their homes, and then left without doing. anything. And then, the landlord on that property has tested the water but won't release the results to the residents. Their young children are bathing in this water, sometimes drinking it, even though they're being told not to, but they're little kids, so they do what they like And it's just something that I think we should look at also at the ag land because that's very important. I know you're the Commission on Water Resource Management, but if not you, who? If not when  if not now, when?",0,B1,07/26/2023
I need to respond to what you're saying.,0,B1,07/26/2023
You're obviously referring to my comments when you said that I  somebody said it was irrelevant. Wrong.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"I did not say that. What I said was that we were starting to range too far away from the water issue, so don't  don't go mischaracterizing my comments, please.",0,B1,07/26/2023
Other than that  other than,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay, thank you. Could you wrap up? Could you summarize your testimony?",0,B1,07/26/2023
I'll just stop there. That's fine. Thank you very much.,0,B1,07/26/2023
All right. Thank you very much for your testimony. Is there anybody else in the room that would like to provide a public comment?  (No response.),0,B1,07/26/2023
Okay. I'm going to go on the YouTube. I have Susan. Go ahead.,0,B1,07/26/2023
Can you hear me?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. My written testimony contains a slide show for you since that's one of your favorite ways of getting information. In the slide show, I'm referring to several references when the Navy provides a supplement, the DOH and the EPA need to respond to it. So some of these slide show  the Navy's response to the DOH comments of 15 March closure plan, the Navy's response to EPA comments of 7 April, some information from the Closure Supplement 2, which they received after they already provided the comments, and then because  I transfer the FTAC, excerpts from the FTAC. I don't plan on going through all of these slides because I believe they're self-explanatory, so I provided talking points for my testimony. I would ask the chair if you can find out if the public can get a link to the QR code because I don't even know how to use a QR code, so that would be helpful for me and maybe for other people. The other statement I'd like to make is anything under 266 parts per billion will be designated as non-detect. I do not support any reuse of this facility. I know the legislature's looking  legislators are looking at some kind of revenue; they need to realize that it's gonna take for years to get these pipelines out, so we have plenty of time to start planning and talking. If there is money received, this money needs to be put in some kind of trust for the people that have drank and are seriously ill from the contamination. Thank you, Susan, for giving a brief update on Dr. Brewer's memo, and I can provide the video and my transcripts of that to the commission. One part of the Navy's response was",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Susan, Susan, can you summarize your testimony, your comments?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yes. There's two points I want to make. The Navy believes reuse is outside the UST closure requirements and are not aware of other closed USTs that have been reused for nonfuel purposes. These are taken directly from my references And the last one is during the FTAC, the DOH presented reduce, recycle, and reuse; neither the HRS 382.G nor the underground  there's nothing saying that these tanks or that place has to be reduced, recycled, and reused. I just don't want this kind of information going out unless somebody can point me to exactly a document that says USTs must be reused. Mahalo.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Thank you very much, Susan. I've got next is  is it Abbey Seitz? If you can unmute yourself? Are you here to testify on Item B1?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Chair, I think she's here for B3.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay, okay. Is there anybody else  is it Franz?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"On Item B3, Chair. Sorry, they're just",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. No, very good. Is there anybody else that I'm missing, Kathy, online?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. With that, I'm gonna close public comments. This was really just for informational; there's no action to be taken.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Chair, Chair, I have a",0,B1,07/26/2023
I have a question of Susan Gorman-Chang for Shut Down Red Hill if you could return.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"You heard the discussion of the Navy, you heard what they did report on, you heard our questions and what we sought. What did we miss? What was  what do you think are some important things that were not raised that we ought to be looking at?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Thank you. Number one  I think Susan Pcola-Davis brought this up too  when they say non-detect, they need to give us the exact parts per trillion, whatever that is, not just not detect.",0,B1,07/26/2023
So (inaudible) full characterization or whatever,0,B1,07/26/2023
you'd like more specific data.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"The second thing is I'd like to know if the Department of Health is going to revise their health advisory system based on the information in this. There's a lot more chemicals people were exposed to, and taking those all at once is different than just looking for jet fuel. The health implications are really",0,B1,07/26/2023
A larger suite of chemical analysis?,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Right. Based on this Department of Health reports, are you going to revise your medical advisory that said do not just test for jet fuel in people's blood?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"You know, I  we will look at that, but I  I have to talk to our toxicologists. So we'll look at that.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. (Inaudible), yeah.  Okay, let me see. Yeah. Another thing, so we're all talking about reusing Red Hill, and we're all staring at this, you know, chart that says 54 percent of the people don't want it repurposed, and yet there's this assumption that we will repurpose it, and this discussion keeps going on almost deaf to the fact that most people don't want it repurposed. Why are we proceeding with trying to repurpose it? Again,like Susan said, revise, repurpose, recycle, whatever; I don't think that's a valid reason.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Can I respond? So it is a  in all things, and in a lot of things when we're dealing with solid waste, those are the three Rs, reduce, reuse, and recycle, and so we  it's not a requirement, it  in this context.",0,B1,07/26/2023
So you're choosing to do it.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"In this context, it's not a requirement. It is would you please look at this and determine whether, one, you can reuse it? For example, some people have said, Why don't we get the University of Hawai‘i to do a research center there, or why don't you make it into a museum? Those are reuses of that facility. It is  it may not be, but that's what people are  some people are saying. So it's not that we're gonna  that it's gonna happen, it's just will you take a look at these three criteria and see if you could reuse it and recycle it? Meaning could be taking out the pipelines and using the pipes or the electrical system and reuse it in some other way. It's just these are three  three words that we want that  we want the Navy and the public to think about. Is there a way that you can reuse or reduce or recycle this facility to make it a better facility or to make it into something different? It's not a requirement; it is a goal of ours",0,B1,07/26/2023
Okay. So there's still the option of just closing it and not repurposing it?,0,B1,07/26/2023
I feel like we're throwing good money after bad.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"I thought we  we covered that. I  my question was, what did we miss? We had  we had a good discussion   (Multiple speakers.)",0,B1,07/26/2023
of that because we said we want some criteria.,0,B1,07/26/2023
We want to see what the  the options are. We want a thorough analysis of each option.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"But again, as long as the (inaudible)",0,B1,07/26/2023
And we see what the public thinks.,0,B1,07/26/2023
That data is clear.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah. I'd like to bring us back to the agenda. I mean, Neil, is that what you wanted? Is that what you asked?",0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay, all right. So hearing no other public testimony, no other  any other questions from the commission?(No response.)",0,B1,07/26/2023
I am going to close,0,B1,07/26/2023
"I do have one. So this is addressing Susan again because of the first item you brought up  and maybe Commissioner Ho. My understanding is that Dr. Brewer's findings, once released, sort of sit in the lap of what DOH takes care of. What role or what important insight do we as commissioners make when we're often tasked with water quantity issues? You know, how do we  how do we use this information to guide our efforts? Is it relevant? You know, how do  because it seems like important information. I was reading it last night.",0,B1,07/26/2023
So this assessment was really done to help CDC in its efforts.,0,B1,07/26/2023
So that was the sole purpose for the drafting of this document. CDC will take this document.and do what it needs to do to analyze and come up with its own findings.,0,B1,07/26/2023
Okay. This  okay. And then there's  there's this public understanding  and I'm just trying to understand,0,B1,07/26/2023
where some of the tension or frustration may lie and,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Yeah. I feel like as Department of Health, you're supposed to be looking out for our health, and so to say that you're just gonna give it to the CDC and not, like, revise your medical advisory",0,B1,07/26/2023
"So we are  we're constantly looking  and as you know if you know Roger Brewer, we're constantly looking and revising our EALs and all kinds of things. So it is  it is something that we are constantly looking at. I can't commit to you today that we are going to change our advisory because that's not  I'm not the SME, but I can say that we will  I will bring it back to my team to look at and make a determination.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And I think it would be a disservice if you didn't, in my opinion, revise that medical advisory based on the information now that you have that it's not just jet fuel, it's the solvents, it's the deicers, it's all of those things in there. And the impact it has on people.when they're  when they're exposed to it all together.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"If I may, can I intervene?",0,B1,07/26/2023
Switching to my UH hat.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"I think reviewing it, the complexity of the biology of this situation requires a different, you know, expertise. And I do think that is CDC, but I think there's a need for, like, you know, specialists and experts that may not be employed by DOH. So I think it's a really important landmark to convene more conversations around and what, you know, about how to  how to look for the effect of, you know, the deicers, for instance",0,B1,07/26/2023
"that do have neurological impacts, but are, you know, showing up in people and increasing, for instance. So I know this from my UH side. So making sense of all these different lines of evidence is really hard to do in a regulatory space. You know, a lot of us may not be specific specialists. So I think there's important conversations that need to be had and, you know, you're bringing it up here, but maybe they do need to be organized and worked out",0,B1,07/26/2023
"And I  it's been a while since I reviewed  since I've read the medical advisory, but I do believe that the medical advisory didn't prohibit anybody, anyone from seeking medical attention, and it didn't prohibit any of the doctors from doing the appropriate things that they thought were necessary.",0,B1,07/26/2023
"(Inaudible), but that's a conversation for another time. And I guess",0,B1,07/26/2023
our other frustration is you're silent,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Excuse me. Can I  can I just call order to this? I want to stay in our lane. I mean, I think these are great conversations. DOH has its own platform. I would like to bring us back. I mean, we're still on the first agenda item, and there are several other presentations. So, you know, I understand the frustration, the tension. I think the intention of these public platforms was to create  provide a space for the Navy to provide us good information. Clearly, there are other platforms available for specific subject matters. And this one, Kathy, is probably more in your wheelhouse when you have other public meetings regarding DOH. So can I bring us back to the water commission? Okay? Okay. So I think that was the last testimony on the Navy's Item B -",0,B1,07/26/2023
Can I add something?,0,B1,07/26/2023
Can Kathy Ho please let the public know when their next public forum will be? Because Susan and I would love to join you. Thank you.,0,B1,07/26/2023
"Okay. Thank you very much. I'm sure Kathy  check her website, she'll  she can make that available, but yes.",0,B1,07/26/2023

"Dean Uyeno with the Commission Stream Protection and Management Branch here to present on submittal item C-2. Approval of stream channel alteration permit application scat 5955.3 by the state of Hawaii Department of Transportation. The project is proposing to widen the Kalihi stream bridge on the ocean side of the H1 Highway and affect approximately 14 linear feet of the East and West Bank wall to accommodate the extended bridge abutments and foundations. The details are in the submittal and just want to note that we did not receive a comment letter from the State Historic Preservation division. We did however receive comments from the division of aquatic resources and the division of forestry and wildlife and so their comments are reflected in the recommendation. If I may, I would jump straight to the recommendation, but the commission approved stream channel alteration permit SCAP 5955.3 application subject to the standard conditions in exhibit four and the special conditions outlined below. a) approval is subject to SHPD concurrence to SHPD requires conditions authorities shall be delegated to the Deputy director to attach those as a condition of the stream channel alteration permit in confirmation with conformance with the Hawaii division of aquatic resources recommendations. The permittee shall ensure stream flow connectivity around the project site at all times with no more than 50 percent of the stream channel being diverted around the project area to enable ‘o‘opu and opae passage incorporated by reference to exhibit two. The applicant shall contact the division of aquatic resources should unforeseen events pose a potential threat to the aquatic environment in conformance with the Hawai‘i division portion of wildlife recommendations. The permittee shall seek to minimize impacts in a species, utilizes native plant species for landscaping and prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species and the letter from the division of forestry and Wildlife is attached to exhibit three.

PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Deputy Dean Uyeno,0,C2,06/18/2024
Staff shared progress on the Waimea Watershed Agreement between the relevant parties.,0,C2,06/18/2024
"The first step in that, I think we identified three steps to this that number one, let's agree on the scope. Before we go out in cost, it seemed like there were a little different ideas on what the scope of the project would be. Have we got that nailed down?",0,C2,06/18/2024
"No, not at this point. I think part of it was getting the cost and figure out...",0,C2,06/18/2024
Don't you want to do the scope before the cost?,0,C2,06/18/2024
"I think to be able to pick and choose, I can’t recall the discussion that we had but in order to...",0,C2,06/18/2024
"The scope of what's required to fulfill the obligations of the mediation agreement, then secondly the cost of that, then third since we were considering an in lieu payment by KIUC, then a determination of how you best use the monies that you have from KIUC and any other sources. I thought the first thing was the scope of work required to fulfill the terms of the agreement that they all have together.",0,C2,06/18/2024
"Sorry, I can't recall that discussion. Maybe if any of the parties want to jump in.",0,C2,06/18/2024
"My understanding was, you're right, it was identifying the scope, but it sounded almost like KIUC might have been willing to do more or I think they wanted to see the Cadillac version versus the minimum. Maybe if the Cadillac version was something that they could afford then they wanted to know the cost of that to determine what would be the section. I may be wrong.",0,C2,06/18/2024
"Originally, there was contemplation on a phase one and a phase two and the phase one was really done in anticipation that there would be a phase two. But now there's not going to be a phase two so we said okay, we got to go back and figure out what is essential. What was planned here that was agreed upon because that then can be costed so that you can develop a dollar number that then KIUC is considering to contribute to then a whole new capital improvement plan because we've agreed that just doing a phase one as originally contemplated, it may not be optimal. The phase one made sense in the context of being a follow on phase two, but if you're not going to have a phase two, then you might use the money differently, but you got to figure out how much money and the money goes back to the agreement which was the phase one. You got to get that before you can get the money, then you can redesign with that money the best system for now.",0,C2,06/18/2024
"Aloha Chair, thank you. I just wanted to clarify we understood the three steps as you described them with the scope being the first step. From our perspective, the scope is the 2018 plan that everyone reviewed and approved, that is the scope for KIUC's commitment here, from our perspective. I won't speak for anybody else, any of the other parties on that, but that is what we are working on getting a cost estimate for, a current cost estimate for. Once we have that, then we can follow up with the other working parties and the Commission, but I do also want to clarify for the record we are not open to expanding our scope beyond what was reviewed and approved. That is the limit of what we are willing to do, that was our commitment.",0,C2,06/18/2024
"That's clear, that's helpful, Dawn. So, we're looking now at the July meeting.",0,C2,06/18/2024
"Make it happen, in spite of all the vacations.",0,C2,06/18/2024
"And Dawn, there's a commitment by KIUC to complete the scope and the cost estimate, Dawn?",0,C2,06/18/2024
"We are working on it, we do have conflicts with the currently scheduled working group meeting in July, as well as the Commission meeting in July. I will have to work with Dean on some dates on when we can get back to you. Once we have the cost estimates, then we can follow up on the timing piece, but in the interim I will check with Dean on some other options for dates to meet with the working group parties at least.",0,C2,06/18/2024

thank you for that clarification. Correct.,1,B2,04/18/2023

"our recommendation and priority is the diversion within the stream channel, that's where we focus on. Based on testimony and the conversation, you folks want to recommend that could be taken off site then that's fine, but that's not within what we're recommending.

She is a born and raised resident of Kawela and a member of Molokai No Ka Heke. She expresses her support for the action to rectify the mess caused by old pipes and diversion materials in the area.

"An attorney from Earth Justice representing an organization that filed a petition in 2019 to amend flow standards for the central Moloka‘i streams. He asks that the ranch be compelled to go through the formal abandonment processes for the specific purpose of cleaning up many of the derelict pipes that are left unused. He expresses concern about the permit’s unclear language regarding on-site storage for disposal and the need to clarify whether any of the pipes could potentially be reused and stockpiled for future use. The Kawela watershed, where the pipes currently sit, is not the same watershed as the intakes that are being considered for potential future reactivation. He suggests that MPL has a facility a little bit further down the road where the various intake pipes converge into a warehouse and could be a logical place to store unused pipes. He also mentions that the East Kawela dam around to the East Kawela tributary intake, and the vast bulk of that pipe is not within the stream bed but instead just laying along the access trail. Finally, he expresses concerns about leaving the pipes on-site and suggests that the pipes should be taken somewhere they can sit with MPL’s other stuff if they are going to be reused. He also submitted written testimony including pictures.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"He would like to ask the commission to urge MPL to remove their rubbish from our streams and our riverbeds up on our mountaintops. He feels really sad to see things up there that don't belong. Growing up his mother was a lei crafter so they would go to the mountains to go pick different flowers and ferns to make leis for graduation and special occassions. His mom had no daughters to pass this tradition onto so, he took it upon himself to carry on the tradition and pass it on to his kids.",1,B2,04/18/2023
He just asked that MPL takes out their rubbish from our mountains.,1,B2,04/18/2023
"As a community member, asked that the MPL dispose of their rubbish out of East and West tributary. Also think it's dangerous to have old metal and pipes on public access trails.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"Testifies on behalf of the community of Molokai and expresses her disappointment with MPL’s management of the land. She states that it has been a year since they agreed to clean up and restore the land, but nothing has been done. She emphasizes the importance of responsibility for landowners to take care of their land for the future of Molokai.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"The State Ala Hele trail system runs through the mountains where the pipes and derelict materials are located, and the Molokai community often accesses these areas through that trail. The last picture shared yesterday showed Kahekili and Kamaki walking next to a pile of rubbish on the trail.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"She expresses concern about the derelict pipes that have been sitting in the area for a long time and have no use. She doesn’t understand why they’re still there to begin with and suggests that MPL team up with the community to dispose of the rubbish properly. She has passed by their disposal site on numerous occasions and describes it as a messy and lazy way to dispose of the rubbish. She believes that hauling the pipes out of the area is common sense and that MPL should be able to bring them right back down. She concluded by stating that it’s unfortunate that the Water Commission has to order MPL to pick up their own rubbish, as it goes against what we are taught from a young age about picking up after ourselves.",1,B2,04/18/2023
thank the community and the applicant for testifying and taking action to close the diversions down. Removing pala and returning the property in the condition it was received or better is standard practice. I propose inserting a recommendation to remove the pipes and concrete in accordance with a plan approved by commission staff and to ensure that any proposal to reuse the materials is credible and stored appropriately. I trust staff to evaluate the proposal and ensure proper storage.,1,B2,04/18/2023
"I guess I would take that one step further. I don't know if we even need a plan. My fear is liability, it's in the Ala Hele trail that's adjacent to that. I would believe that MPL, Cal, and your team see that this is appropriate to remove property from the state lands. All the abandoned infrastructure that was part of that stream diversion.",1,B2,04/18/2023
He appreciates the suggestion but doesn’t believe it's within the commission’s jurisdiction to order removal of the materials beyond the stream area. He invites Harold to explain why the materials may be appropriate for reuse and why stacking them away from the stream but on MPL-owned property is appropriate instead of moving them down. He also emphasizes the importance of staying within legal jurisdiction.,1,B2,04/18/2023
"Molokai Ranch is the sole owner of the land in the forestry area, and not state land. It is difficult to access the area and there is a high cost of using a helicopter. The Ranch hopes to comply with the Water Commission’s intent without incurring excessive financial costs. Removing all surplus pipes is time and resource constrained and materials that cannot be reused could be removed gradually over time. There will be significant effort required to access and remove materials from the project site.",1,B2,04/18/2023
Harold can you further comment on the potential to reuse if Kamoku was reactivated.,1,B2,04/18/2023
"the black pipe that was referred to earlier is HDPE pipe and it could be cut into smaller links to be handled and then refused and used quite happily one ridge over, rather than taking it all the way out and having to pack it all the way back in. When the time came to hopefully reactivate the Kamoku intake.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"I suggest an amendment that if the pipes are planned to be reused, they should be stored in a manner that does not affect safety along the trails or any of the trails used for these traditional and customary practices. The concern is about the impact of storing pipes and equipment on the access for gathering and the need to access these resources.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"for MPL, we'd be fine with that recommendation. And frankly fine with Commissioner Hannah's recommendation that we submit a plan to staff that incorporates the science those kinds of guarantees.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"thank you chair, that was sort of my question for Kaleo. Is that in the staff submission the landowner is listed as MPL so, I think that was clear. My other question is what is the range of public access to this area? Is it limited to the trail? Is it a sort of free-ranging access? If you could clarify that and then my last question is how far beyond the stream does the commission have the right of governance?",1,B2,04/18/2023
"I understand the legal questions surrounding access to private land and our job is to ensure that if anyone is gathering lei material in the forest, we support and ensure it happens within their jurisdiction. We can make feasible recommendations to protect the public trust, but within the context of the Water Commission’s authority; the diversion works permit and the actual materials used are usually within their authority. The potential amendment to store the pipes in a way that doesn’t affect health and safety along the trails is in alignment with their public trust duties.",1,B2,04/18/2023
but the suggestion that we have the ability to govern the precise placement and use of these materials once removed. Is that covered within our authority?,1,B2,04/18/2023
"I'm not governing that at all. My proposed recommendation is to ensure that materials are not stored in a way that blocks trails or impacts health and safety when access is needed. The proposed recommendation is in line with the commission’s obligation under the code and the Constitution to remove diversions, but in a mindful way. I’m open to the AG’s providing further guidance on the matter.",1,B2,04/18/2023
Does a landowner have any right to acquire enjoyment of his property?,1,B2,04/18/2023
"The land in question is private property, and the testimony received is related to access. Under Article 12 Section 7, access to undeveloped lands is protected for Native Hawaiians. The proposed language is not meant to impose specific requirements on the landowners, but rather to protect their right to access. The amendment is to ensure that materials are stored in a way that does not impact health and safety on the trail. The focus is on managing the practice while protecting the right to access.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"Okay good Kaleo, thank you very much. That’s helpful.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"I am guilty of holding onto items that I think I will reuse someday, just like the pipes. If there is a permit or a plan to reuse the pipes, it makes sense to move them to the site efficiently. However, without a plan, they could sit there for a long time.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"The decision to reactivate Kamoku hasn’t been made yet, and the request of the Water Commission to remove all pipes out of the stream could create a financial burden on the ranch. I suggest allowing the ranch to take care of the pipes and only revisit the issue if there are concerns about how they are stored. He does not want to create more burden on the ranch than necessary.",1,B2,04/18/2023
It’s currently our authority to permit these structures and in permitting them I think we can condition what happens when they are removed when they are no longer allowed.,1,B2,04/18/2023
I’m going to defer to legal counsel on that one.,1,B2,04/18/2023
we are discussing the potential reactivation of Kamoku and the request from the Water Commission to remove the pipes from the stream. I suggest that the request could be met with several mandates of effort rather than creating a financial burden on the ranch. The lifetime of the improvement and the use of the material should be considered. The need to condition the removal of structures when they are no longer allowed and the potential to reuse the pipe at Kamoku for the reactivation of the diversion. I agree with the suggestion to require a plan that staff approves and commit to not stacking the pipe in a way that impacts health.,1,B2,04/18/2023
"no, maybe you make a recommendation. I think we've learned the hard way with all due respect. It's really hard to micromanage things on site. I support Commissioner Hannah's recommendation with a plan approved by the staff. The minutes are very clear. I have total trust in the Molokai community that if they're not happy with what they see they will come back to us. And I truly believe maybe this is a dream Molokai Ranch is trying to improve their relations with the local community they're going to do the right thing. So, I would move to approve item B2 with the amendment that a Commissioner Hannah’s recommended.",1,B2,04/18/2023
I don't think we're ready for our motion just yet.,1,B2,04/18/2023
"if the area under consideration is in a conservation district and confirms that it is based on the submittal. My personal experience as a master’s researcher working on Kamehameha lands, where they had to adhere to certain rules when pouring concrete. With the decommissioning of telescopes on Mauna Kea it is possible to organize Heli-ops to transport materials, and I know from my own experience coordinating with a watershed partnership. The materials may be grandfathered in, but I encourage the Commission to consider ways to leave the place better in the spirit of stewardship. I appreciate the steps already taken in that spirit, particularly regarding the water and lands of Moloka‘i.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"I believe that the Water Commission needs to balance the interests under Ka Pa‘akai and have heard from the community about traditional customary practices being exercised in the area and people with lineal connections to the place. I believe that appropriate mitigation measures should  be adopted, such as the removal of the pipes, and suggests that the Moloka‘i Properties prepare a plan approved by the staff but would like to see a deadline to ensure timely removal. Harold and Cal, when do you think you could remove the pipes?",1,B2,04/18/2023
obviously the good weather days. I would think the time limit of like six months or less would be reasonable.,1,B2,04/18/2023
that makes sense and I suspect that many of the people that testified today might even be willing to help.,1,B2,04/18/2023
"that’s a good chance, I would say.",1,B2,04/18/2023
"this is the beginning of a cooperative relationship. I have a hunch they would probably expedite this even quicker than six months, but I think six months seems to be reasonable. This may be an opportunity to create a bridge with these community members to work hand-in-hand with Molokai Properties to make them whole and bring this place back.",1,B2,04/18/2023
I'm prepared to make the motion that we adopt the recommendation of staff with the amendment that the removal of pipes and concrete be in accordance with a plan submitted by MPL and approved by commission staff within six months.,1,B2,04/18/2023

Okay and the objection is?,0,C6,11/21/2023
"The objection is right now it is not clear whether the Attorney General represents the Commission. I know she represents you. Second of all, since we have taken opposing positions on the lawsuit she cannot represent both sides and so Attorney General has taken a public position which really is in compartment with yours and the Commission is in opposition. She cannot, according to the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court, represent us, the Commission.",0,C6,11/21/2023
Would you like to go into executive session with the attorney general to discuss that matter?,0,C6,11/21/2023

Briefing on the Commission’s Approach to Addressing Water for Temporary Housing Needs for Areas of Maui Affected by Wildfires,0,B2,02/20/2024
Staff provided an update on CWRM’s water permitting process for temporary housing projects serviced by Maui DWS and private purveyors.,0,B2,02/20/2024
"This is really a desire of transparency so that the Commission was well aware. Things are moving very fast on the Maui temp housing and FEMA is primarily taking the lead here. The state is deferring to the county and their priorities, but both CWRM, State Historic Preservation Division, our Engineering Division, our Land Division, all of our different divisions are playing a role in assisting on the Maui temp housing. But water is really critical so we felt comfortable in reviewing both the Code that if the county is a provider, then that would be considered an existing use versus if we had a private purveyor, that would require a new permit. We just wanted to update you on that.",0,B2,02/20/2024
What proportion will there be between the Department of Water Supply and private?,0,B2,02/20/2024
With the existing use permits that were filed?,0,B2,02/20/2024
"No, when the temporary housings are being put up, any idea about which ones are going to be covered by private purveyors?",0,B2,02/20/2024
"No, not at this point. Things have been changing almost weekly so I could tell you one thing today and it might be different tomorrow, honestly.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Larry, we are encouraging them like with State Historic Preservation Division to facilitate this process because we’re not trying to cut any, to stay with county purveyors.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"If these are temporary housing, then they’re going to be built much faster than regular housing. As far as the timing permits, do we have a process that we can speed it up or?",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Unfortunately, they’re following under our existing process set forth in the code so that’s why we’re encouraging them to try to utilize county water supply to facilitate the process because otherwise we would have to go through all the 140 permits before we issue out a new permit.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"That’s right, I forgot about that.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Which is quite significant, yes.",0,B2,02/20/2024
Most of that what I presume would be for household use and would therefore require treatment most likely by either a private or public utility?,0,B2,02/20/2024
"I was digging a little and I understand there are three candidate sites, two of them being in sort of West Maui Lahaina aquifer sector. The one that FEMA put forth as having a final EA and finding a no significant impact is the Kāʻanapali temporary housing and then my understanding is that another potential one is Leialiʻi. Kāʻanapali is currently serviced by Hawaiʻi Water Service and Leialiʻi/DHHL is serviced by MDWS, is that correct?",0,B2,02/20/2024
"The DHHL, I’m not sure.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"This is why we’re looking at private or MDWS as having implications for the Commission. Then yesterday in the news there was a groundbreaking for a Kāʻanapali employee, sorry Kapalua. Sorry, obviously I don’t know West Maui geography very well, but that would be under an existing use, right? Because they already...",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Could be, we haven’t gotten the full details on that.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Ok, so there’s different arrays of temporary housing, too, like private, federally funded and I am not a housing person.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"It is a moving target, so I think the State is trying to utilize the FEMA funds as the priority. We are trying to direct them to areas that we think both from a Historic Preservation Division standpoint less cultural resources, minimal impacts, already existing archaeological inventory survey will facilitate the process because they also have to comply with Section 106, likewise with CWRM. Ultimately the decision will be made by FEMA and the county and the state, but we’re trying to direct them to, if you’re looking for facilitated process, giving them some guidance like utilize the county. We’ve been in discussion with the county as well.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Pertaining to water, specifically the Kāʻanapali group housing since it’s served by wells in Honokōwai that have historically had some chloride issues and writing off of B1 ask, is Hawaiʻi Water Service working on a water shortage plan? Because it’s maybe not a problem now, but as housing infrastructure is built and temporary housing becomes something else, we’re going to be putting strain on Honokōwai, which is already strained and that’s our responsibility. I know things are moving fast there, but how are Commission staff thinking about how we take a regional approach?",0,B2,02/20/2024
That’s certainly something we’re going to have to look at in the bigger picture as we go through the water use permit applications. My understanding is Hawaiʻi Water Service has been doing it now is that they’ve been rotating the pumpages on their batteries of wells to avoid the chloride issues. If they see an uptick then they’ll shift their pump to other sources within their system.,0,B2,02/20/2024
"So, it’s just within. On item B1, Eva mentioned working on interconnections so my understanding from reviewing the Maui Water Use and Development Plan, Lahaina sector is that there are no service interconnections in between different purveyors in the system. Is that true?",0,B2,02/20/2024
"There’s no backup redundancy. That’s something maybe not necessarily for us but could be an issue in the future. My question to Dean is how are we as a Commission thinking about our due diligence to ensure protection of public trust in this area where we’ve already had some challenges like Commissioner Miike mentioned? We’ve tended to just award permits, but how are we putting some bounds on that? Have we given thought to that?",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Honestly, I haven’t given too much thought to it yet. I haven’t had a chance to really review all the water use permit applications that have come in. Certainly, our staff, Alexa, and Ayron in particular, are well versed in the area. I think it’s really going to come down to a balancing of priority uses and the public trust. There’s going to have to be cutbacks for certain uses that aren’t public trust uses and certainly we’re going to have to look more critically at water shortage plans in this area and how we apply those plans in water shortage situations. In the next agenda item, we’re going to bring up some bills and we left out the ones that are basically dead, that have been deferred or didn’t get a hearing. As was mentioned in the prior submittal item, there was a bill for emergency water shortage situations and emergency declarations. Right now, there’s only one bill that remains and that would have been a great tool that in this situation where you have water purveyors, you have both private and County and in those water shortage situations, I think was mentioned prior, there’s very few if any controls over the private purveyors and how that water is used. I think that bill that was introduced would have given us a little more power in those situations or our ability in those situations to spread out the use so that it’s ensuring that it is for public trust uses in water shortage situations.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Ayron mentioned some innovative suggestions way back in September/October about R1. Has there been any progress on that? I know FEMA money expires and you need to move fast but that could alleviate. My understanding is the Lahaina wastewater treatment plant does produce R1, well some portion of it is treated to R1 and some portion of that R1 is used but there’s a lot that isn’t.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Ayron may be able to speak to that better. The county is certainly working towards expanding their use of R1. There is currently a bill that is seeking to provide tax incentives for the purchase of reservoirs and such to expand the R1. It kind of just took a broad brush that we can go over, but I think we’re certainly promoting to the County that they expand their R1 use in the region.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"If I can just add on to this. The Lahaina fire has definitely required all of us to really pivot. Right when CWRM was beginning to start focusing on the Water Management Area designation and looking at the water use permits, it might have almost been that same day the applications were due is when the fire hit. Now, moving into the recovery stage, Maui temp housing has really become a critical focus of CWRM and how do we help facilitate. I think that the approach that CWRM has taken on saying what’s an existing water use that doesn’t require a water use permit, one really trying to support the County here, the county DWS in all of their efforts. If it has a county connection then it should help facilitate that process. Because the Maui refocus has required us to be more reactionary than proactive, the way that we’re approaching it is still trying to be one, supportive of the County, recognizing that private purveyors, we don’t have as much control over that. I’m trying to support the Maui County including both in legislation on how to provide them more resources to emphasize alternative reuse or recycled but also giving them the tools to also potentially acquire some of these private systems to supplement what they have. This has really required CWRM to dedicate a tremendous amount of resources to assisting on the Maui temp housing. Again, this is just temp housing. This effort is not intended to look at permanent affordable housing, this is just Maui temp housing for the Maui residents who have been displaced by the Maui wildfires.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Just again, background. You have 140 permits currently, more to be added. I guess two questions. One is what kind of resources are you going to avail yourself for these permit reviews to do it in a timely manner? I sense that timing is important. Secondly, because this is for temporary use, is there a sunset on these permits?",0,B2,02/20/2024
"For the first question, our staff is reviewing them now. They’re focused on working their way from Honokohau – south. They’re meeting weekly and we’re meeting weekly as a staff. They’re meeting individually to review permits, draft letters that need to go out if information is missing. How fast that goes, I think last year we gave a general idea of mid 2024 that we could start to address them. I think we’re at a phase where it’s at least that long if not maybe a little longer.",0,B2,02/20/2024
How does that comport with the sense of establishing these housing units?,0,B2,02/20/2024
"We are advocating that Maui DWS serve the projects. If it is private, that’s a discussion we’re going to have to have as far as temporary housing goes. They are temporary, there is a requirement that they need to be, I don’t know if the term is removed or taken down or what have you, but there is a sunset date. My understanding is that FEMA requires the housing cannot be left there in perpetuity. How that plays out we still have to have those discussions.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"That to me maybe helps in terms of taking rather than a real comprehensive holistic view, it’s just establishing residency with the understanding of a sunset, that you can reexamine the process again. I think if your timetable for actually granting permits is within the view of whoever the purveyor is or whoever the residents establishing that, I think that’s what you need to drive towards. Thanks Dean, I know it’s a challenge.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"To say the least, but they’ve been doing remarkable in really trying to facilitate. I think the temp housing, they’re looking at two to three years. Most of these housing, they’re modular so they’re all being shipped in. A lot of them are coming in on barges as we speak and trying to have spaces available to put them. Again, these are intended only for temporary but we’ll see what happens at the end.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"So, there is a sunset on these?",0,B2,02/20/2024
"I think it is two to three years, the term of the emergency proclamation and FEMA’s commitment.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Aloha Chair Chang and Commissioners. My name is Elena Bryant testifying on behalf of Earthjustice and I’d like to make six brief comments on agenda item B2. First, we want to thank Commission staff for briefing this issue in a public meeting because it encourages transparency and given the significant community interest in this issue, we appreciate that the Commission is updating the community in this way. That said, without specifics including sites it’s not as helpful as it could be so to be useful the info briefings really need to include specific sites. Second, we support temporary emergency housing for Lahaina residents and we agree that it makes sense in this situation that water for the temporary housing would be covered under Maui DWS’ existing use because it’s only shifting end uses from Lahaina to the new temporary housing site. We also agree that any new purveyor would be required to apply for a new water use permit. Our interest here is making sure we aren’t heading into another plantation disaster capitalism situation and we’re here to help you makaʻala and ensure everything is pono given that you are truly our kahuwai pono. Third, we are concerned about the possible use of an emergency proclamation in this matter. While you folks haven’t directly addressed that, it’s the clear implication given what the Governor has shared of potential sites via the news. This is a significant concern given that the Governor has not been pono with his use of emergency proclamations in the past so we’re closely monitoring this to ensure that any EP would honor the public trust and ensure that emergency powers are not abused as they have been in the water context in Maui Komohana in the wake of the fires. Fourth, we are wondering which sites are being considered. There’s been talk in the news by the Governor for example about Leialiʻi and other talk about Kapalua and Kāʻanapali as mentioned by Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani and without more information on sites, the briefing is less helpful. The community needs to know what’s on the table. Fifth, based on Eva’s presentation on B1 where the highest use for Maui county is 291 or so gallons per day, we expect that the requested allocation for temporary homes presumably without irrigated outside areas via any County system should be in alignment with the County’s actual numbers like 300. Even that’s generous. Based on Eva’s presentation, it seems like it’s more around 200 in most areas and 300 in areas with larger lots which isn’t what you’d get with temporary emergency housing. Regardless, there doesn’t seem to be a need for 600 GPD of allocation in the state water system standards if the County’s actual numbers are closer to 200 or 300. Finally, we believe it is critical for the community to continue to be updated as the temporary housing projects proceed and so we respectfully request that the Commission continue to hold these types of informational briefings but with information on specific sites and if it doesn’t plan to do so, we would respectfully request that Earthjustice continue to be updated on this issue moving forward. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"My only comment is that I know, Chair, you said that the housing issues are likely temporary at this moment, however I’ll just urge the Commission to consider thinking of this holistically and understanding that infrastructure will be put in place with these temporary housings. I guess my suggestion to the Commission is to look at it as if there is a potential for these housing projects to become permanent. Just keeping that in mind because of the amount of investment and infrastructure that will be put in place so please consider that as you go through the permitting process and consider the water distribution. Mahalo.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Wayne Tanaka from Sierra Club of Hawaiʻi. First, I really appreciate the opportunity to get some insight into what’s going on with the temporary housing project. I also really appreciate the Chair’s comment about the importance of community involvement and engagement in the last agenda item and I think that’s particularly heightened for disaster recovery with so much at stake and with some of I guess the missteps we’ve seen in Maui Komohana and then some other uses of the executive emergency authorities. We want to state our support for the Maui Komohana community and their involvement in their recovery efforts. I support the Commission’s effort to keep the public informed and to express our caution against using emergency authorities to unnecessarily evade community engagement and consultation, particularly when the community are the folks that are most familiar with their ʻāina and most invested in their long-term well-being and can help identify some unintended impacts and also can actually support some of the priorities that the Commission has mentioned including R-1 reuse. I do want to encourage the Commission to continue keeping the public informed including with some of the specifics that may make these kinds of meetings, these briefings more meaningful and accessible. I would respectfully suggest maybe having a meeting in Maui Komohana for the next briefing or presentation on these matters, particularly when you have more specific information for them to consider. With that, thank you so much and looking forward to hearing more.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"Given the testifier’s sort of press for community involvement in a process that is essentially kind of bureaucratic and needing to be fast-tracked, we got a couple suggestions, but are there other ways in which we can help support transparency given the contention of water issues and the interactions with housing and the distrust that needs to be reestablished.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"I’ll take that one on and then Dean you can add to that. Our intent with this agenda item was really to provide the Water Commissioners an update on the approach that CWRM was taking on the temp Maui housing. Given that it’s a Water Management Designation area and how are we addressing this and so it wasn’t really intended or designed to be on specific Maui temp housing projects. I think the County may be having some forums on discussing Maui temp housing and in our view that would be more appropriate there. Here at CWRM I have been trying through our Water Commission meetings to provide a public platform to inform the community but in this particular instance it was really to update the Commissioners on how we were approaching the permitting process given the Water Management Designation, but not specifically intending to talk about Maui temp housing. Just a clarification. I appreciate the fact that there’s been many comments about that, the lack of transparency. I am all about process but I’m also wanting to be very cognizant that to a large extent these projects are in flux. We are but one component of the regulatory review process and the State is really trying to support the County of Maui in their determination of priority areas, locations. We provide guidance to facilitate the process, find a location that you’ve got water rather than trying to be reactionary, trying to assist them. Where do we have existing water resources in particular I think as a matter of policy for me, too. I’m really looking at how do we support the Maui County, Maui water department because it is consistent with our water code as an existing use permit. But determination of housing areas, we’re leaving that up to the County and FEMA and who’s really identifying those. If there is a suggestion that we have this on our regular agenda, that was probably not our intention, that we weren’t going to be providing updates to the Water Commission on specific Maui temp housing projects if that’s what people were looking for. Were you interested in that, Aurora?",0,B2,02/20/2024
"No but reviewing the final EA and the one or two sentences on water resources and knowing that there was a 9-day comment period, I wasn’t aware of this until Civil Beat posted the link. Anyways, I guess it didn’t sound like they had talked to anyone and especially because Honokowai was the one section that has problems. If I went back to the Lahaina designation and DOH (Department of Health) has a lengthy description of how chlorides regularly exceed thresholds, six out of nine wells. I just want to make sure that we are not creating potential problems we’re going to have a harder time dealing with down the road and that we also are makaʻala to that issue. Hawaiʻi Water System has a certain number of wells, I mean where’s that water going to come from? So, we’re not reacting as much and I know we’re all in reaction mode but how can we be more proactive and maybe we have to give a little more attention and background to the decision makers who are making these really quick decisions and consolidate information for them just so we don’t have more problems down the road and that was the whole point with designation.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"I will assure you, CWRM staff that participate in these discussions, they are conveying those sensitivities. I think they have a good appreciation for the concerns that have been raised and they make those very clear in some of those internal discussions.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"And then let us as Commissioners know how we can back up and allow you to do that work, too. Again, I say nobody can fire me from my volunteer position.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"This was really a courtesy to the Commission and to members of the public to give you an idea of how CWRM is making determinations as they provide input into the ultimate decisions about these different projects. With that determination comes a lot of sensitivities and that’s why the determination to support DWS if the County is providing that it’s an existing use. Private purveyor, that’s a new use that requires a new permit that will go through all that engenders so much more of the regulatory review processes and participation. We’re trying to be very helpful to Maui temp housing. We have residents that need more stable housing, I take not permanent, but they need stability so we are all trying to be part of a solution but yet at the same time not compromise the positions that the Commission has taken in the past regarding many of these sensitive and critical issues. I’m trying to walk this very fine line.",0,B2,02/20/2024
"I just had an additional comment. You had mentioned that it’s the County and FEMA who are going to take the leads in choosing the location which we completely understand and agree, but I just wanted to note in order to make the determination about whether a use is reasonable beneficial, the Commission does need site specific information. I think this is important especially if the Commission isn’t going to be issuing a water use permit which is the is the case with the County and so I just wanted to add that.",0,B2,02/20/2024
Appreciate that comment. What I can share is I think our CWRM staff include that balance as part of the contributions that they make to these discussions. Thank you very much.,0,B2,02/20/2024

"PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Ryan Imata, Ground Water Regulation Branch Chief Staff stated the summary of request in that the Commission approve the modifications and reduce allocation.",1,B1,03/19/2024
Is it typical to bundle multiple wells under a single permit? What are the criteria?,1,B1,03/19/2024
"That’s a great question. A lot of times what happens is if wells are close together, we consider them to be batteries, but in the case of the Board of Water Supply, they might have a Wahiawa 1 one station and a Wahiawa 2 station that have their own independent allocations. I think in this case when they’re all tying into one end use and the end use is going to be reflective of that 0.351 total, they can pump from each well as they would need to. Another example would be the Navy system where they have Red Hill shaft, Waiawa shaft, and Halawa shaft. Each of those have their own allocation. In this case though because the end use is consistent and the wells are relatively close to each other, I think it’s more appropriate to give them one water use permit than giving them one for Mokuleʻia 1 and then one for Mokuleʻia 2.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"Are there implications for, just looking at the map, there are a number of wells in the area. Can you talk us through - do you see any problems as pumping is shifted across those that we should be thinking about, or given the hydrogeology, is that not a concern?",1,B1,03/19/2024
"I have to check, they will need to get pump installation permits and those will require pump tests.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"From the submittal and the attachments and doing a little bit of my own background, it seems North Shore Water Company draws from other wells and those aren’t being discussed today. Maybe it’s outdated, a draft EA (Environmental Assessment), there was discussion of a few future potable wells to support that system. Is that factored in?",1,B1,03/19/2024
"Not yet, they haven’t applied for them and I believe that 3310-001 and - 002 will meet the existing demands but the applicant is here to expand on that.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"Exhibit 1, of the well locations, all of those are active wells?",1,B1,03/19/2024
"Probably not. Whether they’re pumping or not, I’m not sure.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"I guess my ultimate question is, in your analysis of the monthly pump usage for the two pumps, what is a sustainable yield from this aquifer relative...I know this is a small amount withdrawal, but just to put everything in perspective, how much headroom do we have in this aquifer?",1,B1,03/19/2024
"That’s a good question, that’s why I like working from my computer. I can do this and blow up the map and see what the sustainable yield is. Mokuleʻia, Queenie, what’s the sustainable yield? I can pull it up on the website. Mokuleʻia has headroom, I’ll just say that. It does have headroom.",1,B1,03/19/2024
What I do remember is allocations that we issue are under sustainable yield and the total usage is...,1,B1,03/19/2024
I see the total usage is way under.,1,B1,03/19/2024
"That’s just for the two wells, but if we’re talking about the entire aquifer...",1,B1,03/19/2024
"Well, we want to put it in perspective from where we sit. I think the individual approval of this permit in context is okay, but again helping us put everything in context by aquifer is very helpful. We have all of these well permits, whether they’re active or not, but they all have allocations allowed to them.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"I’ll apologize for that, I should have been clearer in that presentation. Typically, in a management area if I’m asking the Commission to approve an allocation, all 17 MGD, thanks Queenie, if I’m requesting the Commission approve an allocation, criteria number one is that there’s available resource. What I’ll do is I’ll inventory all of the existing allocations, I’ll inventory all of the DHHL (Department of Hawaiian Home Lands) if there is a DHHL reservation and other existing applications, just from an allocation standpoint what’s available. Then, we also provide a table showing the 12- month moving average of all of the wells in the area. Again, I apologize for not supplying that information here, but I thought that because it’s being reduced from 0.500 to 0.351 that that information wasn’t super pertinent. I will put it in next time.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"Again, put everything in perspective relative to...from my point of view, this well change in pumpage should be ministerial, really. That’s okay.",1,B1,03/19/2024
That’s true and part of the reason why we presented this to you today was because it was the subject of a contested case hearing. I just wanted to make sure that the well was...,1,B1,03/19/2024
That has been extinguished because of the 72 parcel.,1,B1,03/19/2024
It was stayed. I think due process would allow the objector to still file for a contested case hearing based on the information that we provided today which...,1,B1,03/19/2024
"Doesn’t appear so. I can’t say, but I don’t think so.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"When Commissioner Meyer asked about, oh what are all the different wells, are they required to report to you to provide CWRM regularly?",1,B1,03/19/2024
"All well users are required to report their monthly pumpage, chlorides, and generally non-pumping water levels, although we don’t get a lot of those.",1,B1,03/19/2024
Do you get regular reports from all of the wells?,1,B1,03/19/2024
"I can’t remember what the percentage is in Mokuleʻia, but we have pretty good reporting percentages. In an effort to increase our reporting compliance, we had a project maybe four or five years ago. It was an outreach project. We hired a consultant to go out to all of the wells in management areas at first and teach them how to read their meters. We’ve increased the compliance for reporting quite significantly through that outreach program. We’re not 100% perfect but we also have an online system that people now log online to report their pumpage and their chlorides. It’s a pretty easy system and we’re constantly refining it and just trying to get perfect data.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"What I realize is without good data, we have a difficult time making informed decisions. I’m also wondering, for those who aren’t complying, do we send them notices that they’re not in compliance and give them an opportunity to cure their non-compliance? Because I’m assuming that is part of their permit conditions.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"If they don’t have a water use permit, they still have to report. The thing that we’ve been struggling with over the last couple years is compliance and an avenue to find people in violation. One thing that we’ve looked at is the CRV process through Bin to maybe take these very routine non-reporting things and just hand them off to that program to implement. The other thing is I’m kind of excited about reorganizing our branch to actually built in a compliance section because I know there’s been a lot of discussion from Commission and from the Leg for us to look at things like four-year non- use. I want to expand it beyond just reporting components and make sure that people are pumping in their allocations. We issue allocations, what good is it unless we enforce it. We’re not perfect, again we’re implementing projects to try to get those things done.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"How do you cover those administrative costs for monitoring, requiring them to provide reports, monitoring updates and then inputting. Do you get that through general funds, do you have a source of funds? Because what I’m trying to get to is and maybe this is a rule amendment that we are charging an annual fee for all well permits.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"We’ve talked about annual registration fees, too.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"Annual registration fee so that we have a source of funds to help with that administrative cost of monitoring. I’m not in any way suggesting we’re going to do that here but I really do want us to look at that. Again, if we’re looking for good data we need to make sure you have the capacity to do that. The only way, we have to have a source of funds to do that. I would like us to look at whether that’s a rule amendment, whether we put that in because there’s a new water well permit that’s coming. I’d like us to look at that being a standard condition that we require not only a one-time fee for a new well but an annual registration fee. Whatever we call it, but some kind of an annual because I do think we need to share those costs. The fact that you come in late and we charge you a fee, everybody else who’s got a permit they should also share in those costs for us to get good information. A little diversion but I think administratively I’d like us to move in that direction. We’ve taken this particular agenda item as a good launching point for a lot of other issues, but I’ll bring it back to this particular agenda item.",1,B1,03/19/2024
I have one more question on that. I had trouble reading the end use of parcels because I couldn’t rotate this. I don’t have authority to rotate the screen and plus it’s blurry. Is that what’s there now? It looks like a perfect match of the quantity of the allocation that they seek to all of the uses that are there. And those are current uses?,1,B1,03/19/2024
Bob Strand represents them and can answer those questions.,1,B1,03/19/2024
"So, they have adequate water for all the uses that are in place?",1,B1,03/19/2024
"All of the existing uses, yes. This table in and of itself doesn’t show the exact calculation. They show the units and I guess that’s how it calculates out. For example, I’ll just use the first one. Single family duplex customer meters I think is 54. If you multiply that 54 by...exhibit 2.",1,B1,03/19/2024
It’s super blurry. It’s unreadable.,1,B1,03/19/2024
"I’ll just describe what it says. Basically, the table on the right-hand side, the box table, that’s the Department of Water Supply water system standards has an average daily demand for different types usage. They’ll identify on Oʻahu, it’s about 500 gallons per unit for a single-family residence. They have 54 customer meters and they multiplied that by 500 gallons per unit and came out with 27,000 gallons per day. Totaling all of those existing uses based on the duties that are described in the Department of Water Supply table, they came up with basically 0.351 MGD. I substantiated that with the graph that I showed on page 3 showing that they’re actually pumping 0.2.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"According to the North Shore Water Use and Development Plan, it’s actually 8 MGD for sustainable yield for Mokuleʻia. I’m seeing different numbers. Since that question came up. But it’s under used, so it’s overallocated in terms of permits but the actual use is much lower than sustainable yield. We’ve got some things to think about. This is from Mokuleʻia Water Use and Development.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"So, you’re seeing the total uses on Mokuleʻia Water Use and Development?",1,B1,03/19/2024
She’s saying the allocation is over.,1,B1,03/19/2024
"The allocation is oversubscribed and it says on page 1-26 of Northshore Water Management Plan final, it says 8 MGD sustainable yield, water use permits issued 2010 is 8.025 but the water use in 2010, and that’s what’s been reported, is 0.175. Either we don’t have recording or we don’t have usage.",1,B1,03/19/2024
This is the Board of Water Supply plan.,1,B1,03/19/2024
"This is on our website, WDPOA 2016 NS pdf on the planning branch’s website. Maybe for that broader context of Mokuleʻia, we have some things to think about but for this particular permit...",1,B1,03/19/2024
I believe based on our report from our database 17 MGD is the sustainable yield and allocation is 7.817.8 and 17 are very different. Is this an outdated document?,1,B1,03/19/2024
"I don’t think Mokuleʻia has ever been 8. It’s always been around 17. This is from our website, it shows 17.",1,B1,03/19/2024
This is the County water use and development plan for the North Shore.,1,B1,03/19/2024
If that identifies the sustainable yield as 8 then that’s wrong.,1,B1,03/19/2024
I’m looking at the numbers now.,1,B1,03/19/2024
This is a 2008 map. That’s a big difference!,1,B1,03/19/2024
"We’ll have to look at that a little bit deeper, but yeah just based on my knowledge of the situation I knew that we weren’t over allocating water, plus they’re requesting a reduction.",1,B1,03/19/2024
It doesn’t have bearing but I personally have some homework to do to understand this aquifer sector area.,1,B1,03/19/2024
"Bob Strand, I represent Dillingham Ranch and the North Shore Water Company. I don’t have much to add to Mr. Imata’s presentation, but I’m happy to answer any questions.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"To that point that was just being made regarding the sustainable yield changing, I could just touch on that. It’s maybe not great for my arguments but just in the spirit of transparency. The sustainable yield was changed from the long-standing sustainable yield of 8 million gallons per day by the 2019 Water Resource Protection Plan. You can find more details about the issues regarding that in Protect Mokuleʻia Hui’s objections that were filed on May 25th of 2020 which kind of initiated this whole proceeding. The Water Resource Protection Plan changed assumptions. You have to read into multiple footnotes in the resource protection plan and then go to a different document that’s referred to in it to get to the fact that they changed the assumptions about how water was coming down gradient from the Wahiawa aquifers and going into the Mokuleʻia aquifers. Before they were doing it by linear distance of adjacent aquifer. The Mokuleʻia aquifer doesn’t have that much adjacent area to the Wahiawa aquifer whereas Waialua aquifer does. Then they now changed it to make it equal between the three aquifers under some new assumption which was not really well explained. At any rate the water resource protection plan of 2019 increased sustainable yield in Mokuleʻia from 8 to I believe 16 or 17 million gallons a day. My name is Mike Biechler. My house straddles the line of the Waialua and Mokuleʻia aquifers. I also have a small orchard, one acre farm in the Mokuleʻia aquifer and someday I anticipate that I may be sitting in front of you or going through this application process for a well on my farm, as well. We’ll see how that goes, but I’m also a staunch environmentalist and fiercely protective of the environment around the area where I live: the ocean, the water resources where I live, especially the nearshore ocean resources. That’s thoroughly detailed in our contested case and if it gets back to that point, we can address those issues more. That’s kind of how I come to sit before you today and I’m a representative not just of myself but I’m also the representative of the organization, an unaffiliated group named Protect Mokuleʻia Hui comprised of a number of people but six named representatives including myself that filed and were granted a contested case and are going through that process. Right before the hearing was about to happen, this amendment came through, this letter requesting to amend. I’ll start off by just explaining what my end request is and then maybe give you my reasons afterwards. My request is that the Commission defer action on this application to address the issues and gather more information. It seems like some of you have hit on some issues that maybe need some additional information and clarification before action can be taken. I do understand some of your inclinations that maybe this should be administrative because they’re actually requesting less water or something of that nature, but what they’re asking for does have serious effects on the aquifer and my position and Protect Mokuleʻia Hui’s position is that the contested case hearing is stayed, not extinguished. We’re not required to refile an application for a contested case hearing since this is an amendment to a stayed application subject to a contested case hearing. I think procedurally because of the way this came to be, we would not have to file an application for a new contested case hearing to continue disputing any issues that have arisen in this. As it may, if the board sees it otherwise I may just for good sakes demand a contested case hearing if that becomes necessary. I’ll reserve the right to that if that comes up. Getting to the merits of what’s actually presented here, I think one thing that needs to happen or needs to be clear if this is going to be approved is, what’s happening with these other permits? There’s a number of wells on the property, some of them have been capped and closed but some of them are open and have very large allocations. The Shop well for example, well number 3410-03, has an allocation of 1.5 million gallons per day and their own record in their EIS (Environmental Impact Statement) which is the most recent pumping data I’ve seen for it when they were going forward with this project, their EIS shows that they use 53,000 gallons a day but they have 1.5 million allocated. There is this four-year non-use provision and I for the life of me can’t figure out why this hasn’t been revoked. I do believe there’s a communication from the Commission to the Dillingham Ranch, Aina LLC the prior land owner, saying use it or lose it and I think they kind of got held up when they finally submitted this water use application. If this is getting resolved, I think the issue of these revocations or these other permits and allocations does need to be addressed as well because they have a 1.5 million allocation and they’re using 53,000. There’s clearly some stuff going on here. Maybe it would be better to part and parcel it all together especially since they’re asking for the Crowbar Ranch well to be put together with the upper-level wells 1 and 2. To the issue of where the water is going, I think there needs to be more specificity regarding the TMKs. The two documents I have, one is a chart or graph that was attached to their letter asking for a stay, the other is this thing that was attached as exhibit 4 to the staff submittal. Going to the exhibit four attached to the staff submittal, there’s one lot that’s curiously on there two different times, tax map parcel ending in -37. It’s account number 1 and 1a, that’s Mike Daily. I believe that is the lot immediately next to the polo fields and then at the end of the third page there’s also a lot named KN1 Kaena North LLC which I could not find that entity. Regardless the TMK is the same so it’s not clear what’s going on with that if that’s referring to the same two meters, if they’re double counting that customer because it appears that TMK already has two meters but it’s listed again there. My main concern with this list of TMKs that will be served with this is that it contains every single parcel in the Dillingham Ranch with like 2,600 acres or whatever. That it contains every single parcel when you see these DRA1 and DRA2. If you go to the chart that was attached with their original letter I believe it’s now exhibit two here, this has a little blue line at the top of it and the only water reference at all on this as going to something that could conceivably be on those parcels is equestrian. It says equestrian, 150 horses, 75 gallons per horse, that would be 11,250 gallons per day. All the other things, I guess there is a ranch office...I will try to summarize. I have a pending contested case, so I have what appears possibly as much knowledge as anyone on the topic here, but I appreciate your desire for brevity. There’s a lot of discrepancy between what’s listed on this letter that was attached to their request for a stay and the TMKs that they’ve presented. Basically, they haven’t done any effort to meet their burden to demonstrate that it’s reasonably beneficial or that they’re using it in the amount that’s needed. The records show they need it in 200,000 gallons per day, they’re asking for 350,000 gallons per day based on some spurious calculations. They are entitled to what’s reasonably beneficial and what’s necessary, not just whatever they want. I think they need to put that information, any information to meet their criteria in the application. The only place they provided any information that could conceivably meet their burden regarding the effects on existing uses, existing uses being nearshore water resources and Native Hawaiian cultural practices, which three of our Protect Mokuleʻia Hui members are claiming damage to their Native Hawaiian cultural practices. That needs to be described somewhere, that needs to be in the application. You need to be able to look at this information as the board deciding this thing and find out what are the likely effects of this on the nearshore water resources. They’ve only referred everyone to an EIS. It’s obsolete because it’s for a product that’s not happening, it’s 900 pages long with thousands of pages of appendixes and not even the most diligent person at the Water Commission has read that, I’m certain of it. It is a massive document and the references are scattered throughout and I don’t know how you could possibly think that you have the information regarding the effects of this on the nearshore surrounding uses. My last point I will make is regarding the bundling of these two wells. They’re not drawing water from the same place. The Crowbar Ranch is in the caprock, it’s down low. If you took everything that the applicant has said in their contested case hearing and all their filings together, they adamantly believe that that caprock where the Crowbar well is, is not connected to the aquifer where wells 1 and 2 are. Wells 1 and 2 are high level above 200 feet elevation, Crowbar Ranch is at 30 feet elevation or 25 feet elevation. They’ve maintained that the Wells 1 and 2 are an artisan aquifer that’s not connected in any way, against all logic and knowledge of how water works, not connected in any way to the other aquifer and it makes no discharges to the nearshore marine area. I adamantly disagree with that but that’s been the position they’ve espoused this whole time and so connecting them on one water use permit when they’re drawing from ostensibly separate aquifers and at much different manners and everything is a little bit nonsensical. I wouldn’t have any complaint or concern about considering Wells 1 and 2 a battery, they’re right next to each other, they’re at similar elevations, that makes sense. I think that is common I don’t think it makes sense to put Crowbar together with Wells 1 and 2. They’re extremely different and I do truly believe and we have documents that can show it, we’ve had Charlie Ice, I mean lots of people have said this over many years that there is subwater discharges into the nearshore marine area and the effects of that need to be considered. That’s the basis for our contested case hearing and is an issue that remains even if this is granted today. Again, my request is that you defer action on this amended application today to obtain more information, to get more clarity on the effects on the nearshore marine area, issues regarding the water usage and things of that nature that I’ve laid out. If in fact you don’t take that recommendation and you do decide to approve this, I truly believe that you need to make the revocation of other non-uses but existing allocations allocated to the applicant or on the property. Those need to be resolved here, they need to be subject to the revocation or modification of those permits. That’s actually what they said they would do in their EIS. They said that they would revoke all the other ones, give up all their other allocations if they got what they wanted and so hold them to that, please.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"I think Mr. Biechler raises some interesting points and there’s a lot of discrepancy in the data, information we have, but sometimes a 100-mile journey begins with the first steps. I think having a return of some of the resource to clarify what’s going on with these wells and true them up, if you will, is a step in the right direction. It doesn’t solve all the problems and I think we need to get to those, but I can’t see where in terms of Ka Paʻakai or any other analysis that the reduction of, and we’re not even changing how much is being pumped. What’s being pumped is being pumped and that’s under the new amount let alone the former amount of the allocation. I don’t see the harm in taking that step and using that as the impetus for taking more steps to find out who’s doing what out there and to really true up the amount allocated to the uses that are permitted so we have a better understanding of what’s the gap between that and sustainable yield.",1,B1,03/19/2024
I’d like the record to reflect that we have Commissioner Larry Miike who has just joined us on Zoom.,1,B1,03/19/2024
"I have a follow up comment and a request for staff, specifically Ryan. Maybe sometime in the next couple cycles, update us on those discrepancies on Mokuleʻia. I came in after those changes so the documents that are even on the Commission website, including that Board of Water Supply report don’t reflect the current status and we need to be able to articulate that we are making good decisions for the aquifer and show that we are doing our due diligence to consider public trust in these. I think we have homework, I don’t know if it’s an update on the aquifer, maybe in an informational briefing down the road I think could be helpful just so that we’re all on the same page.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"I did find Mr. Biechler’s comment about the Crowbar Ranch well, it does seem to be a substantial distance. I can see Mokuleʻia 1 and 2 and given the fact that there’s a reduction I’m more comfortable, but is there a reason why that’s also being included? I know your comment was because it’s all being used for the same allocation. It is a substantial difference so if we’re looking at close location, a reason why Crowbar Ranch?",1,B1,03/19/2024
"Normally when we issue an allocation, we’ll render the previous allocation superseded, one permit will supersede the other permit. In this case because the Mokuleʻia 1 and 2 Wells can’t be brought online tomorrow or even next week, they require PUC approval. From an inventory standpoint, I don’t want to have one allocation for Crowbar Ranch and then one allocation for Mokuleʻia 1 and 2 but it’s a chicken and egg thing because I think they have to go to PUC with the approval of the water use permit prior to getting approval from PUC.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"That’s correct. Right now, the only well that’s operative is Crowbar Ranch well and it’s got issues and it doesn’t have enough water pressure for fire flow protection purposes. The long-term plan at the ranch was to drill the mauka wells which were drilled, cased, and capped and eventually when they are activated, which requires pumping and we have to get PUC approval for the expenditures and everything, the Crowbar Ranch well will no longer be used. Those two mauka wells, together with the reservoir that would be placed up there, would be the main source of water with one well being pumped at a time, the other one being a backup. They’d be operated in tandem or battery as Mr. Imata said and Crowbar Ranch well would still be there. I suppose if both wells went down we might use it but that would be a last resort because right now it’s doesn’t have water pressure sufficient for fire flow protection. The long-term plan is to put the two mauka wells online but as Mr. Imata said, it starts here. This is the first step, getting the water permit from the Commission then we have to go to the Public Utilities Commission, we have permits from the city and county, we have an easement from BLNR, so there’s a whole plan going forward. This is the first step to get approval, for these three wells eventually to be permitted, but with the mauka two wells replacing the Crowbar Ranch well [inaudible].",1,B1,03/19/2024
"Assuming you get PUC approval for Mauka wells 1 and 2, will you resubmit your application to DPP for the 72 residents?",1,B1,03/19/2024
"First of all, Dillingham Ranch ‘Aina sold the property. We have no plans to resubmit it. My understanding is the new owner doesn’t have any plans to resubmit it. They have I think seven large lots that they plan to do some housing, they could do maybe a couple of houses in each lot. Mostly it’s going to be maintained in agriculture there now at the 72-lot subdivision. The approval is all expired so nobody has any plans to re[inaudible].",1,B1,03/19/2024
MOTION: (HANNAHS / KATAYAMA) To move forward with further work that would clarify amount of water that is being utilized under permits that exist to reconcile the record.,1,B1,03/19/2024
"I also heard the comments about effects on nearshore and in that clarification can you address what the Commission is doing to evaluate the potential effects on the nearshore? That might be a technical question. I don’t know what we’re already doing or if that’s going to be a new development, but at least come before us and help us understand how we evaluate potential nearshore impacts.",1,B1,03/19/2024
I would hope that that would have been discussed at the initial permit.,1,B1,03/19/2024
I would like a clarification. The amendments to me are independent of the permit application. Can we de-link them somehow and treat recommendations 1 and 2 as part of the permit and these other requests for staff as independent and not subject to getting the permits approved to move forward?,1,B1,03/19/2024
"So, it’s now part of the record of the minutes.",1,B1,03/19/2024
"I think rather than being amendments to the permit application, it should be a recommendation to staff that in future analysis and presentations that they comprehend this.",1,B1,03/19/2024
Thank you for the clarification.,1,B1,03/19/2024
We’re going to decouple the...,1,B1,03/19/2024
"Yes, the change in the allocation to the applicant is not conditioned upon anything [inaudible], it’s what’s set forth in the submittal, but as part of the record, in adopting this motion, we’d like staff to have...in future cases a better record upon which to make our decisions.",1,B1,03/19/2024
Can we withdraw that first motion and just restate it so that it’s absolutely clear?,1,B1,03/19/2024

"Item B-2, and Item B-2 is approval of Stream Channel Alteration Permit Application, SCAP.5954  dash  well, 6, and special conditions.",1,B2,06/20/2023
Do we have a staff presentation?,1,B2,06/20/2023
"Okay. Oh, Dean. Go ahead, Dean.",1,B2,06/20/2023
"Good morning, Commissioners. Dean Uyeno with the commission's Stream Protection and Management Branch, presenting on Item B-2. This is, as Chair mentioned, approval for  requesting approval of a Stream Channel Alteration Permit SCAP.5954.6 by the County of Maui Department of Public Works. The project proposes to restore a section of an embankment covering an area of approximately 5,000 square feet along the Wailuku River for flood protection purposes in the Millyard Light Industrial Subdivision at Wili Pa Loop, Wailuku, Maui. Commission staff stands by the submittal, and if I may, I'm just gonna read through the recommendations.   So Recommendation 1 is that the commission approve the Stream Channel Alteration Permit subject to the standard conditions in Exhibit 4 and the special conditions below. Condition 1A. In conformance with the County of Maui Planning Department's recommendations incorporated by reference in Exhibit 1, the permittee shall certify to the Maui Planning Department that no increase in base flood water surface  water  excuse me, base flood water surface elevation will occur. Item 1A. In conformance with the Division of Forestry and Wildlife recommendations incorporated by reference in Exhibit 2, the permittee shall avoid construction and operational impacts of state-listed species, minimize the movement of plant or soil material between work sites as they may contam  contain detrimental fungal pathogens such as rapid ohia death, vertebrate and invertebrate pests such as coqui frogs and little fire ants, or invasive plant parts such as miconia moling which could harm our native species and ecosystems. And consult  and lastly, consult with the Native  excuse me, Maui invasive species community to help plan, design, and construct the project, learn of any high-risk invasive species in the area and ways to mitigate their spread. Item 1C. In accordance with the proposal by the Maui Department of Public Works acknowledging the sensitivity of the project location, the permittee shall implement the following best management practices:- Limiting repair activities to one-half of the stream cross-section at a time.- Limiting construction work to what can be installed and stabilized by the end of the working day for areas within the ordinary high water mark.- Use of a plastic-lined sandbag coffer dam around the stream work area.- Use of silt fence above the ordinary high water mark around the construction access operating area and staging in stockpile areas.- Use of dust fences around the staging and stockpile area.- And lastly, sediment filtering & treatment for dewatering discharge. Item 1D. Issuance of the permit is subject to SHPD concurrence. If SHPD requires conditions, we'd delegate to the deputy director to attach those as conditions. Item 1E. The permittee shall ensure streamflow connectivity around the project site at all times, with no more than 50 percent of the stream channel width being diverted around the project area to enable fish passage. And lastly, Item 1F. To ensure coordination through the project, the permittee shall notify the Commission on Water Resource Management staff and representatives of Hui oNā Wai ʻEhā within one week of when the project is scheduled to start, any issues that may arise during the project work, and when the project is scheduled to be completed. And that concludes staff's presentation.",1,B2,06/20/2023
I believe  I believe we do have consult  the consultants for the project on the call.,1,B2,06/20/2023
"Hi, good morning. Thank you, Dean. Thank you, Commissioners and Chair. My name is Gwendolyn Rivera. I'm with Munekiyo Hiraga. We're the consultants for the County of Maui on this project. Also on the call, we have Kristi Ono from the County of Maui Department of Public Works. We also have Mark Roy from Munekiyo. And from Austin Tsutsumi & Associates, the engineers, we have Adrienne Wong and Rick Evans to address any questions you may have.",1,B2,06/20/2023
"All right, thank you. Commissioners, do you have any questions either for staff or for the consultant?",1,B2,06/20/2023
"So maybe this is for the engineers. I was just  in reviewing the Fish and Wildlife comments about kind of the  the hardening of the stream bank, I just was wondering if you could explain or recap your response on how this wouldn't. I was particularlyconcerned about the potential for downstream scour right below and is that an issue and why it's not, and how  how the design of the structures addresses that. So I'm not sure who the best person to  to respond would be. Maybe PE.",1,B2,06/20/2023
"Yeah, I guess I can take that. I'm with Austin Tsutsumi, the civil engineer on this project. We  you know, it's not gonna speed up the flow beyond this  this bank. It's going to  just in the area where  where it interacts with the hardening, it'll  it'll accelerate in that area, but then we used a roughened grouted riprap edge so that it mitigates the velocity increase there, and we don't expect any increase in velocity downstream. And we did a hydraulic analysis throughout the area from upstream of the project through to downstream to verify those hydraulic conditions.",1,B2,06/20/2023
"I think just  yeah, it just helps to know  how you guys have thought about it and considered, so thank you.",1,B2,06/20/2023
"Any other questions or comments? Yes, Wayne.",1,B2,06/20/2023
"Just a quick question. The 600 cubic yards that will be excavated, to meet the Forestry requests of minimizing the movement of soil, how would that be reused or recycled? Would it be on-site?",1,B2,06/20/2023
cubic yards of excavation that's listed.,1,B2,06/20/2023
"Yeah, so what  what's happened with the stream bank is it's eroded into a near  you know, it used to be at a  at a sloping embankment, and now it's eroded to a near vertical condition. And replacement without doing a vertical wall, which we wanted to avoid doing a wall, is  we sloped it at the maximum possible gradient that we could, and that is what's required in  bringing in a fill to sort of replace what  what has been lost from past erosion. Does that answer your question?",1,B2,06/20/2023
"So, no. Well, the material that's being excavated, Forestry is concerned about vectoring pathogens, so would that material be reused in sort of reconstruction of the embankment, or are you gonna store it on site, or what's the  how are you going to handle that?",1,B2,06/20/2023
"That is a  I would expect that the material wouldn't be removed from the site, that it would be  whatever is excavated would be reused on-site, so I don't  I'm not sure what the  how to better answer that.",1,B2,06/20/2023
"Gwen, would you have anything to add on that one? It's more of a biological kind of question.",1,B2,06/20/2023
In terms of the  the placement of the excavated material?,1,B2,06/20/2023
"I guess, is it leaving the site?",1,B2,06/20/2023
"Excavating. This is Kristi Ono with the County of Maui Department of Public Works. Given the concern, I'm sure within the area, we could find a use for that material, and it does not need to leave the site.",1,B2,06/20/2023
"Yeah, it's not a lot. It's only 600 yards. So the plan is that you will reuse it somewhere backfilling in that area to address Forestry's concern?",1,B2,06/20/2023
"Yes. If it's not appropriate material to reuse specifically for this project, I'm sure within the area of the Wailuku River, we can find a use for it as there are, you know, maintenance practices done nearby that could likely use material.",1,B2,06/20/2023
"Okay, good. Thank you.",1,B2,06/20/2023
Any other questions or comments?(No response.),1,B2,06/20/2023
"Do I have any  those are the only people on the list. Do I have any other  Kathy, anybody else on the Zoom that is here to provide comments on Item B-2?",1,B2,06/20/2023
"Okay. Hearing no other comments, do I have a motion on this matter",1,B2,06/20/2023
So moved to approve.,1,B2,06/20/2023
The motion has been moved,1,B2,06/20/2023
"and seconded. A motion has been moved and seconded to approve Item B-2, the approval of the Stream Channel Alteration Permit. All in favor, please say aye.(Response.)",1,B2,06/20/2023

Update on Water Resources in the Lahaina Aquifer Sector Area a. Wells in the Fire-Impacted Area b. Interim Instream Flow Standards c. Water Management Area and Water Use Permit Applications d. WaterResourceAlternatives,0,C1,09/19/2023
"PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Ryan Imata, Dean Uyeno, Dr. Ayron Strauch",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Good morning Chair, good morning Commissioners. Dean Uyeno, Stream Protection and Management Branch and currently Acting Deputy Director. We’re providing updates to you folks on the water resources in Lahaina Aquifer Sector Area. We’ve divided it up into four sections. First is wells in the fire-impacted area, Interim Instream Flow Standards (IIFS) & Water Management Area, and Water Use Permit Applications, and lastly water resource alternatives. Ryan Imata will be available on Zoom, so he’ll be presenting the first section regarding wells in the fire-impacted area.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Good morning, Chair, Commissioners, members of the public. For the record, Ryan Imata, Hydrologic Program Manager for the Ground Water Regulation Branch. I’m going to be presenting you an update on the wells in the fire-impacted area. So, a couple of days after the wildfires devasted Lahaina, one of our concerns was wellheads in the fire-impacted area. We put a map together as soon as we could find out the extent of the damage and we superimposed both the fire-impacted area and the wells that were in the area and subsequently requested our Conservation and Resource Enforcement (DOCARE) officers to go and do some reconnaissance and to see what the status of all of the wells are. So that’s the map that we based our initial reconnaissance on. You’ll see the orange is the fire perimeter and the green are the wells in the impacted area. So, I’m going to go over what our officers found for each of the wells in the area.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Here's a summary of all of the wells. There were twelve wells in the impacted area. The cliff notes is that two wells appear to sustain some damage. The initial reconnaissance said that one of the wells, I think one was Lahaina Shaft, I’m not sure if it was Pump A or Pump B, appear not to be impacted, but there were some impacts above ground of pump equipment. I’ll go through each one of these in the subsequent slides. The first well can see is 5240-001, that’s Mill Shaft Pump C. That’s an abandoned well, appears not to have been impacted. Photo #3 is 5240-002 which is Lahaina Shaft Pump B appears to not have been impacted. That’s a below ground vault, so I think that was kind of protected from the impacts of the fire. Photo #9 is 5240-003, that’s Lahaina Shaft Pump A. Again, that’s similarly below grade vault, so the impacts were not as significant. Photo #11 is 5240-005, the Methodist Church well. That one, the pump house appeared to be burned down and there were remnants of the pump house surrounding the well, but it’s kind of unclear regarding the wellhead itself. We have to follow up and have our Conservation Resource officers go out and check out that wellhead. The numbers are out of order, but 5240-002...we went over these already. I think that’s a duplicate slide. They do show additional pictures of the vaulted area. 5240-007 is Lahaina Recreation Center. That’s another irrigation well that appears not to have been impacted because it is in the below, like a vault below ground. The next well, the pump house appears to be intact, 5240-008. That’s the second Lahaina Recreation Area irrigation well. Appeared not to have been impacted. 5240-009 Kahoma Irrigation Well, that’s a condo irrigation well that appears not to have been impacted. 5241-001, the Lahaina Surf building pump house. 5241-001, that’s an irrigation well, appears to have sustained some damage, but again the wellhead, it’s kind of unclear as far as the integrity of the wellheads. So, that requires some further investigation. That’s the second of the two impacted wells. These again, that 5341-001, that’s the Wahikuli Pump L appears to be below ground and not impacted by the fires. 5341-002 is the Front Street House well, that’s an unused well. Clearly appears not to have been impacted. This last one is 5440-001 Oil Road. That’s the Wahikuli Irrigation well. That appears not to have been impacted by the fires.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Summary, none of the Maui Department of Water Supply’s municipal water system well sources have been impacted. LIC (Launiupoko Irrigation Company) did inform the Commission that one of the pump controllers of one of the two pumps in Lahaina Shaft A was damaged and is not operational. LIC is using their remaining pump in Lahaina Shaft A at about 1,000 gpm and reduced down to 700 gpm at night to deliver water to the lower Makila Reservoir. And then reiterating that our officers’ inspection on September 3rd and 4th appear to show that only two of the wells in the fire-impact area have sustained fire damage but do require some follow up to determine the extent of the damage of the wellhead...I think we’re entertaining questions after the entire presentation, but I’m happy to take any questions now if you have any.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"If I can just add...one of our concerns regarding some of the vault wells, as we see here, Pump B, is some of the runoff or when there are high rainfall events, runoff, overland flow, getting into these vault wells. We are working with the well owners to shore up or help protect, add some level of protection to these well sources. In the meantime, we have worked with FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) and they are in touch with EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) to provide some BMPs (Best Management Practices, put some BMPs in place in the interim. We do also have concerns and so we contacted, Joanna Seto of the Department of Health regarding water quality concerns in the fire-impacted area. We did also make FEMA aware of some of the wellheads just in the process of cleanup efforts to help ensure that none of these wellheads are damaged in the process and if they’re going to go in with heavy machinery. We have provided them these reports and our preliminary information that we sent to our DOCARE officers to assist in, help them identify these locations in the aftermath of this event.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Thanks Dean and Ryan. So, this is like the status of the infrastructure, but what do we know about heads and chlorides current status and pumping rates as they’ve changed pre, post-fire?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I don’t have any updates right now on head levels or salinity levels. I believe that Department of Health and EPA is taking a look more at water quality issues, but I don’t have any updates for you right now.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"This presentation, Dean, is on our website too, right?",0,C1,09/19/2023
We will post it after this.,0,C1,09/19/2023
"Ok, you will post it. Alright.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Question. So, do we have an idea of when we’re going to get that information? Pumpage and water quality.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"At this point we haven’t reached out to the well owners. I think it’s certainly something that we can do. We’ve just been kind of sensitive to the situation out there. We’re not sure if we’re able to even contact some of the well owners at this time, but that’s certainly something we can work on.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"As we think about rebuilding infrastructure, how are you going to prioritize that?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"As far as the wells go? It will be up to the individual well owners, I believe, in what their future plans are in rebuilding and how they intend to use the wells.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"So, those permits were allocated based on what we knew about sustainable yield and water quality then. So, isn’t it pretty urgent to get the information about what the water quality is now and how that affects sustainable yield so that we can know whether our permits can be retained at their current levels? Or do we have to make adjustments?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"We should be clear that there are existing water use permits that were applied for, but as you’ll see as we go further into the presentation, that we do need to act on the water use permits. In terms of prioritization, we will present it to the Commission and the Commission will make the decision on how to proceed with each of the allocated amounts. In essence, there are no allocated amounts, but I do hear what you’re saying, Commissioner, that I think that we do need to assess first of all the availability of water. Quantity-wise, I don’t think that’s really going to be...sustainable yield is not so much impacted by the fire damage, but certainly water quality may impact the availability of water. We’re going to have to make that assessment prior to bringing existing and new water use permits before you in the near future.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I understand that some of these were not working pumps, but are they all out of commission right now?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I think Lahaina shaft A is online. But as far as the rest of them, they may be operational, but as you saw with the devastation, for example if the...and I’m sorry I don’t know the extent of the end-use areas, I don’t think we were able to superimpose that. But for example, the Lahaina Recreation Center. My assumption is that the recreation center and all of the irrigation that is required had been impacted by the fires. The wells could be operational, but whether they need that water right now, that I don’t know.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"The wells that are in the affected area, they were used to supply water to the burned-out area?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Yeah, so what I’m saying is that we haven’t superimposed the end-use areas of those particular wells. I think our primary concern right now was to look at the wellheads because if the wellheads were compromised, say one wellhead was burnt and was exposing groundwater to surface runoff and contamination. That was our immediate concern and so that’s what we looked at initially. But yeah, we can certainly look into the end-uses and see if those were in the affected areas to see if the wells, if they’re currently online and if they need to be brought online in the near future.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"That was the reason I asked the question was that, if they’re not functioning then what would the users be using in place? And your answer seemed to be that they don’t need it because they can’t use it.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Yeah, like I said, we hadn’t superimposed the end-use areas onto the map, so you’re right. If the areas were impacted, they can’t use it, then they’re not going to be using it.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Ryan. I guess from a 30,000-foot perspective, can you put in perspective for us as Commissioners, how are you balancing the priority with well restoration, with community use. We have a lot of wells that are, right now, inactive, but somebody is working on a priority of restoration. I guess if you’re serving domestic water use versus irrigation, hopefully domestic water use gets a higher priority. I think in restoring use, you have kind of several issues that you need to work on. One is stability of the wellhead. I assume most of these wells are electric powered, so you got to restore electrical service to that and then distribution service to get to the affected communities. Who is working on that balance and prioritization? And are you able to help guide us through this process as we look at how to allocate the water or if the water usage is well within our maintaining the aquifers?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Thanks for that question, that’s a good question. One thing that I will note is that as we summarize these 12 wells, we found that they were all for landscape irrigation or park irrigation. And I don’t think there is a prioritization in the sense of having municipal sources. As we proceed with the designation, that’s part of how we look at designation and prioritization, is really to present to the Commission the bigger picture of all of the applications for all of the wells in the area, so that the Commission can issue allocations based on that prioritization. Of course, we’ll make recommendations to the Commission. Ultimately, the Commission decides on how to allocate for existing uses and also new uses because we got some new use applications for some of the wells. Again, the focus of this portion of the presentation is primarily on the status of the wellheads, so issues pertaining to allocations and how we make recommendations are going to appear later in this presentation. I’m not trying to not answer the question, but I think that those kinds of prioritizations can be addressed in the subsequent portion of this presentation that will then also address a lot of other issues, you know regarding surface water and infrastructure upgrade. Because that’s where I think where there are going to be bigger concerns about being able to provide domestic water and prioritization. It’s coming further in the presentation.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Ryan, if I might. The purpose of this was really to provide you with updated facts. CWRM (Commission on Water Resource Management) is working with DWS (Department of Water Supply). I do want to make very clear, the Water Management Area, the West Maui Designation, that is still in effect. So, there is going to be a presentation on what staff is doing on that. But this was really just to provide you information and the community on the wells and then walk you through all of the different phases that we’re going through. I think as Ryan said, a lot of the questions that are coming up may be answered as we go through and talk about the West Maui Designation process, where we are in the permits and then what will be coming forward to the Commission. We also are trying to be really sensitive. Maui Board of Water Supply, they are just, they’re triaging. And so we are, likewise, trying to be a support system to them, but I think for purposes of this presentation it was to provide you a status update on the status of all of the wells that we are aware of.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Chair, if I might though. Triage with respect to meeting people’s needs is one thing, but I heard you say something that if the destruction of infrastructure might have created certain risks to the resource, contamination of the resource, that needs to be priority. We can’t let that happen, whether that old well is privately owned or not. It’s the public trust that gets damaged if repairs are not made to protect the resource. Are we fully empowered to do that?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Yes, that’s why we’ve been meeting with EPA or FEMA, EPA through FEMA. They are the leads on the clean-up efforts. That’s why we’ve notified them to prioritize getting, especially these vault wells that you see on the top there. To get some BMPs (best management practice) in place to prevent runoff from going directly into these wells. The good thing about some of these wells, Pump A, Pump B, is that they’re mauka of the burn area, fire-impacted area. Some of the other agencies are, USGS in particular, they’re doing some sort of sediment sampling from runoff, and so they are looking for heavy metals, VOCs. Fortunately, these vault-type wells are mauka of Lahaina town, so we don’t anticipate the same contamination that we may see in Lahaina town area, potentially running off into these wells because they are mauka. However, we are still concerned with the runoff.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"For purposes of priority, we’re working along with unified command and priority first is recovery and debris removal. With the debris removal is ensuring that the existing infrastructure is safe from further contamination, whether that’s our wells or whether that’s near-shore waters. We’ve also been tasked with providing potential infrastructure requests for funding, so trying to make that part of the FEMA ask. We have been working with DWS as well as with our own team to provide both FEMA as well as the State; the Legislature has been asking us as well. We are trying to respond appropriately and accordingly...we recognize everybody’s trying to do the best they can. We’re working with initially just the debris cleanup, making sure there’s no further damage, but also including, making sure we have monitoring measures in place. And then on top of that, what’s the kind of funding that we need to request, either to improve, upgrade, or replace these facilities. This is sort of an assessment of where we are at this point and time. But that was the intent of at least this section of the presentation, was to provide you with that information.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Our preliminary assessment with DOCARE was just to get a visual inspection of the wells, a visual assessment. Based on that, one of the things we’re afraid of, again as Ryan mentioned, a direct conduit for contamination right to the aquifer. It appears at this point that the wellheads are still in place, even though some of them have sustained some fire damage. The next step will be to go in and inspect those two wells that were damaged to make sure that there’s no potential for contamination.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Thanks Dean and this question is for Ryan or you. You know, that’s great. I’m not really an infrastructure person, I’m mostly interested in the aquifer. What is our monitoring capacity for this area of West Maui? What is it now? And what could it be as we try to understand the status of the aquifer in terms of quantity and quality. Because they could provide access points for sampling if people are concerned. And not just source drinking water because these are the lower regions right? But people are concerned about coastal water quality and the groundwater discharge. So, if you could expound on that and explain? Because maybe we have an opportunity to also put in more monitoring capacity.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"One of the things we’ve been working on with the Department of Water Supply on Maui and actually we’ve had, I think, two meetings in the past couple of weeks on jointly funding a deep monitor well in the area. So, we’re exploring different places that we can put a deep monitor well and putting a priority on that so we can understand the profile of the aquifer in the area because there are so much competing uses and that will definitely help us to understand the coastal discharge and to help us to understand just the thickness of the aquifer and the transition zone. We definitely are working on trying to establish a deep monitor well. Also getting input from the US Geological Survey on where they think an appropriate deep monitor well is. That addresses the issue of the aquifer thickness. Now on water quality issues, I think that’s a separate issue that we need to address. Water quality is something that we can work with Department of Health on. Department of Health is definitely the experts on understanding water quality and the impacts to the environment based on that.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"If I can just add, too. Thank you, Aurora for that because we have been concerned about near-shore waters, as well. In coordination with DOH and EPA, they are installing, you might have seen several monitor gages inside the near-shore waters to monitor that. We realize informed decision making, so we need good data. We are trying to get USGS and the EPA to support the placement of more water quality monitors.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"So, that’s in the near-shore areas?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Yeah, and then trying to do some in the streams as well.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"But, for this area if the streams aren’t flowing, a lot of it is coming through groundwater, so if there is a good spatial...if one deep monitoring well is very expensive and it only gets you one point. If there’s an opportunity to, I don’t know. I don’t know the infrastructure in this area, but if there are these abandoned wells, could they also be repurposed into shallow monitoring facilities? Just windows into what’s happing to the aquifer because I think there’s concern and the way to battle concern is with information. I just want to put the bug out there.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"That’s a good point. I will tell you what, we’ve got a lot more to the presentation. Ryan, take those notes.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"It might be helpful to reach out to the four or five public utility, water utilities on the West Side, starting up with Kapalua Water and then working down through all of the utility companies, including Department of Water Supply, of course and asking them how their production wells are doing right now, the status. And secondly, whether they have any quality results, any hits, any contaminants. And they ought to be able to get those reports almost overnight to you because they do have to stay on top of those things on a day-to-day basis. It might be useful information on a preliminary basis at this point and I think part of the issues that we’d like to be enlightened about relate to that potable water supply and the public sourcing, if we could. It’d be getting the information quickly.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"We did reach out to LIC regarding the pumpage from Lahaina Shaft A, so we’re in discussion with them now. I don’t mean to put you on the spot, Commission Ho, but I know that the Department of Health and your Safe Drinking Water Branch has been in discussions with Department of Water Supply and the other purveyors regarding water quality. Don’t quote me on this, but I don’t think any water supply wells were super significant hits in water contamination. We will reach out and we’ll work on Department of Health on water quality issues for sure.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"With that, I’ll call up Dr. Ayron Strauch of our Stream Protection Management Branch about instream flow standards.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Good morning, Commissioners. Ayron Strauch, hydrologist in the Stream Protection Management Branch. I’m going to first talk to you about natural flow conditions in West Maui. We have a number of natural flow gaging stations that you have funded over the years through USGS and through in-house staff efforts. These are the natural flow condition stations, one on Ukumehame, one on Kauaʻula, and one on Honokōhau that we fund through the US Geological Survey. And one on Honolua and one on Olowalu that CWRM maintains. We also have a number of regulated flow or instream flow standard monitoring stations throughout West Maui. One on Honokōhau at MacDonald’s Dam, one on Honokōwai below the irrigation system, one on Kauaʻula that USGS maintains, one in Kahoma Stream down in Lahaina town, one on Olowalu and one on Ukumehame that are below the irrigation systems. I’ll take you through the data that we have so far. As you might be aware, West Maui has been in a pretty bad drought for the last few years. I’m going to present all of the data somewhat similarly in style, where we have a continuous record gaging station presented and then flow duration statistics which we can get into the details, or I can give you the summary. The flow duration statistics for the previous three years are compared to the 30-year window which we made instream flow standards on. I’ll start with Ukumehame. The medium flow estimated for Ukumehame is about 5.0 cubic feet per second or 3.23 million gallons per day. In the last three years, our monitoring has shown a 22% decline or 22% less at median flow than what would be predicted. This is natural flow conditions and under low-flow conditions, 8-10%. On Olowalu, we only have about one years-worth of data, so I’m not going to present a set difference, but compared to USGS estimates, we are just about there. Keep in mind that USGS estimated flow at the Upper Olowalu intake and this location’s at just above the Lower Olowalu intake, so there is a little bit of uncertainty with regards to natural seepage loss that we’ve been trying to address with seepage runs funded through the US Geological Survey. On Kauaʻula Stream, we’ve seen about 40% reduction in stream flow across flow duration statistics compared to what would be estimated naturally in the stream. Median flow is about 3.3 mgd, low flow is under 2 mgd in the last three years. And then in Honokōhau, this is the gaging station above the Honokōhau Ditch Intake above all the groundwater gains. The 30-year estimated median flow was about 13.6 mgd and the last three years we’ve only been at only 10.7 mgd. Lower flow conditions are in the 5-10% less than predicted range. Why might that be? Well you’ve probably seen this slide from me before. We’ve had less rainfall. There have been continued declines in rainfall, especially in the mauka portions of these watersheds for a number of years. This is data from long-term trends from 1920- 2012, from 1983-2012. Here is a different data set from 1990-2009 broken down by watershed, percent decline in rainfall. As you can see, it ranges from 7%-12 or 14% decline by watershed. More recently, this is monthly data from the Puʻu Kukui rainfall station that Maui County funds through the US Geological Survey. The top graph, the black line is the average monthly value for that location from 1978-2007 and the bars represent each month’s cumulative total per year over the last 3-4 years. As you can see, we’ve been below average consistently for the last 3-4 years. Another way of looking at the data is the cumulative rainfall deficit. Looking at the cumulative amount of rainfall that we are not receiving at this location over time. As you can see from the graphs, the black line is the average and the gray line is where we’re at as of July 2023. We are just not making up the reduced rainfall in the dry season. Essentially, we’re in a new climate pattern. With that in mind, I’ll talk to you about instream flow standards. In March of 2018, you approved instream flow standards for four hydrologic units in West Maui: Ukumehame, Olowalu, Launiupoko, Kauaʻula. We have a monitoring station below the Ukumehame Ditch. The instream flow standard is established at 2.9 mgd which is represented as what we knew as the Q60 flow or the magnitude of flow that occurs 60% of the time, which means naturally 40% of the time there isn’t enough water in the stream to meet the instream flow standard. This is the monitoring that we have the last three years. This is not a real-time station. We actually visit the station quarterly, depending on our budget. We were last there at the end of June and as you can see, during the wet periods there is obviously more water and during the dry periods less water. That would be expected based on natural flow conditions and the current instream flow standard is established at Q60 flow. These are two pictures depicting Ukumehame Stream. One in lower Ukumehame, just above the highway and one in upper Ukumehame, above the USGS gaging station. As you can see, there were taken on the same day. The Ukumehame like most West Maui streams is a losing stream meaning water naturally recharges the aquifer as it flows downstream. Ukumehame also supports one of the most diverse assemblages of native and amphidromous species in West Maui. There are three of our amphidromous ʻoʻopu and then hīhīwai. Olowalu, last year we did an extensive update on Olowalu and potential violation following that recommended mediated settlement. Olowalu Water Company has modified the diversion to fix the leaks. They have provided for the necessary flow through the diversion or over the diversion through these low flow channels to ensure that they are meeting instream flow standards and they’ve modified the existing accordingly. We also have a newly established instream flow standard monitoring station immediately below the intake and we only have a few months of data, so it’s too early to make any conclusions. We did conduct biota surveys on Olowalu in July and as you can see, similarly to Ukumehame, Olowalu is a losing stream. Both locations are above the lower Olowalu Ditch intake. This is the Lower Olowalu Stream at about 200 feet at Upper Olowalu Stream, about 400 feet. Also a losing stream. In Kauaʻula, I believe in April of 2022, Commission voted to suspend the current instream flow standard in order to provide for the traditional customary practices and domestic needs of kuleana families in the valley. Based on new gaging data provided by US Geologic Survey that the Commission has funded, we now know that there is insufficient water to meet the IIFS at the upper diversion. The tradition and customary needs of the Kapu ‘ohana in the valley, the kuleana domestic needs, the traditional and customary practices below the siphon, and the agricultural needs of Kamehameha Schools. For example, in July while we were there conducting biological surveys, 4.2 cfs or 2.7 mgd was flowing over the damn at the upper intake; however, no flow was observed at the siphon. The only water that was available downstream of the siphon is what was being released at the Kauaʻula siphon, that’s on the right. That means that if the operator were to meet the IIFS at the upper diversion, there would be no water available for the Kapu ‘ohana, which gets their water via the irrigation system. We also want to make sure that we’re protecting instream values below the site, including water available for traditional and customary practices and for native amphidromous biota. There is also domestic need for water via the system. These are the sand filters that provide water for the kuleana families.  I just also want to point out that Kauaʻula Stream has substantial seepage loss as described. It starts even above the stream diversion. The stream diversion identified in that little brow rectangle. The USGS gaging station is just above it. Based on seepage runs conducted by US Geological Survey, the seepage loss in higher up in elevation and continues all the way down to the mouth. We do know that when we restore sufficient flow below the siphon, we get recruitment of amphidromous species. We’ve seen biota in Kauaʻula Stream below the siphon in previous years. Our current status is that on the left-hand side we have two instream flow standards. The goal was to provide mauka to makai flow as well as water for traditional and customary practices, other instream values, domestic needs, and meet some of the agricultural needs of the region. However, we are currently getting a substantially dry stretch of stream and there is not sufficient water to meet all of these needs. There might not even be sufficient water in the stream naturally to run mauka to makai based on estimates of flow that USGS is providing. I’m suggesting that in order to meet traditional and customary practices, to meet domestic needs, and to protect the stream better, we eliminate the instream flow standard at the upper elevation and we modify it at the siphon so that we protect all of those instream bodies that occur below the siphon. So, we want to make sure we’re protecting traditional and customary practices, domestic needs, and Kamehameha Schools tenant needs. In Kahoma, we have instream flow standards for Kahoma Stream and Kanahā Stream. Kanahā Stream provides for domestic water needs, county. We don’t currently have monitoring there, but USGS is planning on installing a station that Maui County funded. In Kahoma, we’ve been monitoring down in Lahaina town. This is the Kahoma intake at about 1,800 feet in elevation. Also, monitoring in the stream in Kahoma Valley. Here’s the data from the USGS station from Lahaina town. We estimated based on USGS data for 2014 that there should be about 2.65 mgd in the stream at about this elevation. Now this doesn’t account for the unregistered stream diversions that have been found following substantial restoration of stream flow. So, this is regulated flow. We have seen consistently 40% less water and this kind of trends with previous estimates across West Maui that there’s just not the rainfall at the higher elevations to sustain stream flow. We have at least three, if not four unregistered stream diversions in Kahoma Valley that meet domestic needs and irrigation, small agricultural plots. Finally, in May of 2021, instream flow standards were established by the Commission in Honolua and Honokōhau Valleys. In Honolua, the Tropical Storm Lane and Olivia destroyed the intake, so that intake was no longer operational by Maui Land and Pine. On the lefthand side is actually Honokōhau Ditch that runs underneath the stream. That’s the concrete structure. Honolua flows naturally over it as you can see. Upstream and downstream of this intake, approximately the same, the stream is also losing reach, so it doesn’t flow at the mouth. We’ve been documenting that the percent of time it does not flow at the mouth for the last three or five years. It’s been about 70-80% of the time it does not flow at the mouth under natural flow conditions. Now those same Tropical Storms Lane and Olivia cut a new channel around Diversion 770 Aotaki Weir which is the primary intake for Honokōhau Ditch. That channel is circled in red on the lefthand side. That provides for a continuous flooded path downstream. We also have instream flow standard monitoring at MacDonald’s Dam in the valley below the return of water at another added adit called Taro Gate. We have estimates of groundwater gains in the stream below the USGS gaging station. We are also making measurements in the ditch and continuously monitoring instream flow standard down in the valley. This is our monitoring station under low flow conditions in Honokōhau. This is the continuous record gaging stations for USGS data, in black, and our continuous record in blue. The bottom screen is the last six months or seven months or so. Essentially under low flow conditions, we are cutting millions of gallons into decimal points to maintain the instream flow standard. I would say the operators, despite the remote location are doing a pretty good job being responsive to returning flow when needed to the stream. Just overall, we don’t have as much water available for things like the County, who gets their water out of this system as well.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Do you have a feel for what the springs around McDonalds, above McDonalds have done over the last say year and a half, two years.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Not in terms if there’s been a trend in spring flow. We’ve only made a few point measurements. They’re really difficult to get to and we just don’t have the time or budget to make continuous monitoring of those sources. We have maybe three different measurements. As USGS estimated, the springs and development tunnel discharges vary overtime with recharge, so as it rains more, there were more groundwater gains to the streams. We are also monitoring Honokōhau Ditch at Māhinahina Weir. This is just after the County gets their water. It’s primarily installed as a way to monitor potential system waste. Water was being diverted out of Honokōhau that wasn’t being utilized by the county, so just want to make that note.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"it’s pretty clear that rainfall’s declining and streamflow is declining. Input into our aquifer bank account is declining. Two questions, what is surface water usage versus groundwater usage withdrawals like in the area? Just to orient myself, is it mostly surface water withdrawals or is it 50/50? Do you know?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"in the County systems, for example, that reply on both surface and ground water, I would say it’s probably about 60-70% surface water. But, Commissioner Meyer might have a better idea off the top of his head.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"The other question is, the USGS did a seepage run, that’s a snapshot in time. Does the gaining, losing locations, can that change with the aquifer status? Say, the aquifer is filling up because there’s a rainier year. Does that length of gainings change continue downward?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"There are specific points that are known springs that discharge directly into the stream. And then there are more diffuse locations that might provide for more groundwater flows into the stream. In Honokōhau, there are at least four known locations where spring water flows into the stream. That’s what contributes to those gains. You can see water pouring out. Two of them are tunnels, two of them are just points. The other locations that are known as gaining streams, they are primarily in the region of high elevation dike water. They’re very well defined and as soon as the stream leaves that high elevation water region, they start losing streamflow. That boundary doesn’t vary over space.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"The third question I have is, we have these records of stream flow, so say they may be above the diversion, but they’re declining and you might attribute it to changes in rainfall, but if they’re responsive to basal and it’s all dike...",0,C1,09/19/2023
"These are at 1500, 1800 feet in elevation far above the basal aquifer.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"So, they’re really telling you the mauka signal, they’re not telling you as much about.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Most of Maui, the basal aquifer does not interact with the stream at all.",0,C1,09/19/2023
This is just to help me understand some of the numbers and the picture you are laying out.,0,C1,09/19/2023
We’re getting less rain. Are we managing lands up in the upper areas to optimize the capture of that rain. Are you in communication with West Maui watershed partnership? Are they fully funded? Are the things that they’ve identified need to be done to better capture the rain that we do get.,0,C1,09/19/2023
"We work hand in hand with DOFAW, as our missions align. I’ll just make a generic statement that they’re not fully funded just as we are not fully funded they could use obviously use more resources to protect the forest, to revegetate. We’ve had a lot of mauka regions that have either been invaded by non-native species, have burned, have been impacted by invasive ungulates. Now we have axis deer problems that we didn’t have before. Everybody is scrambling to make the best use of their resources and obviously we could do a better job of protecting our mauka lands.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Are there ways by policy or by rule we can condition investment in the optimization of capture with permits to withdraw the resource we get down the stream? You want to withdraw it, take care of the mauka and make sure things are happening there so we have it there for your use and for other people’s use. Is there a way to condition that?",0,C1,09/19/2023
I’ll just state that you are the policy makers.,0,C1,09/19/2023
Can we see opportunities before us to where we consider that.,0,C1,09/19/2023
"Yes. East Maui Irrigation, we are developing watershed management plans and having cost-shares. So, yes. We are trying to find vehicles to either incentivize or motivate others to share in the cost. As Ayron said, DLNR, we get underfunded, undoubtedly. I think people are beginning to appreciate what it means by having good watershed protection about how to manage invasive species, including guinea grass. Unfortunately, this heightened awareness may make funds available, but our team is working the best they can with what they’ve got. But we’ve also got great partners that we’re working with. The watershed management partners have been excellent. We are seeking greater investments as well as cost-share with those users. I am trying to make sure that we are creating that condition, that they are sharing in those costs.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"In Maui Komohana, it seems like there is an opportunity with all the gush of resources coming in from all kinds of sources that maybe some of the resources, in addition to rebuilding can be put into the resource itself. Not just to our kanaka needs, but the needs of the ʻāina, to supplement what we have. Second question, there was such a media coverage about that somehow having instream flow standards prevented us from fighting the fires, the wildfires. When I look at your pictures and see the minimal flow that’s in the stream, in your view did the existence of those instream flow standards have any relationship in our ability to fight those fires?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"He said, no. It had nothing to do.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Good morning, Commissioners. Continuing on the agenda Item C-1, Update on the Water Resources in the Lahaina Aquifer Sector Area. We’re going to talk about Water Management Area and Water Use Permit Applications. As you may recall, last year in June, the Commission adopted, then Chair Suzanne Case’s recommendation to designate the entire Lahaina Aquifer Sector Area as both a ground and surface water management area. The map that you see here shows the six groundwater hydrologic units, as well as the surface water hydrologic units. For groundwater, will go from the south, Ukumehame, Olowalu, Launiupoko, Honokōwai, Honolua, and Honokōhau. As far as surface water management areas from the south are Ukumehame, Olowalu, Launiupoko, Kauaʻula, Kahoma, Wahikuli, Honokōwai, Kahana, Honokahua, Honolua, and Honokōhau. In the second bullet there, what you see in bold are the reasons for designation which included harm to groundwater quantity and quality by saltwater intrusion, serious historic and ongoing disputes, climate uncertainty with drought and declines in rainfall and recharge. And then because there is an interaction and connection of both surface and groundwater, we believe that they should be managed in an integrated matter, hence a designation for both as water management areas. The next slide describes the findings and justification with regards to the Commission’s constitutional duties under the Public Trust Doctrine. Even though the Commission established instream flow standards for all the perennial streams in West Maui, except for Honokōwai, public trust uses remain threatened or unfulfilled. We had violations, just as an example, in October of last year we brought an action item before the Commission for a potential violation of interim instream flow standards in Olowalu. In November, as Ayron alluded to, there was a mediated settlement on that matter. Other public trust purposes that are threatened by the lack of stream water include cultivation of lo’i kalo and other traditional and customary Native Hawaiian practices which rely heavily on water in its natural state, of course mauka to makai flow and healthy native stream fauna. Another concern was the 2 mgd of stream water for DHHL or Department of Hawaiian Home Land that may be impacted by other off-stream non-potable uses in Kapalua and Kāʻanapali. Lastly, overall designation expands the Commission’s toolbox to protect water resources and regulate reasonable and beneficial uses of water, including public trust purposes. During the Water Use Application Process, the Commission can make a determination if a use is reasonable and beneficial and if any other public trust purposes are impacted. This slide gives a short summary of the Water Code’s criteria to designate an area as a surface and groundwater management area. As you can see on the upper portion under the surface water criteria, two of the three surface water criteria were met, including diminishing surface water supply and serious disputes. In the lower section you see the groundwater criteria that was met for six of the eight criteria, including increases in water use or authorized plan use, reaching 90% of sustainable yield, water quality degradation, diminishing groundwater supply, chloride content of existing wells are increasing, serious disputes, and then number eight, water development projects that have received any federal, state, or county approval may result, in the opinion of the Commission. As Ayron presented earlier, there is significant reduction in rainfall and recharge of the aquifer. Throughout the whole area, there have been historic and ongoing disputes. We did also want to highlight that DOH had submitted a finding to the Commission that the water quality in Honokōwai aquifer is being threatened. Additionally, there is case law that supports the Commission’s regulation of ditch systems, systems that cross multiple hydrologic units. Some of the maps in the following slides will show, for example Honokōhau which crosses multiple hydrologic units. There is also a cross-over and interconnection of the hydrologic units in Launiupoko. This is just an example of the Honokōhau Ditch system, how it crosses across hydrologic boundaries and so on. This table that you see above is from the June staff submittal of last year on designation. It relates back to the groundwater designation criteria that when increase in water use or authorized plan use may reach 90% of the sustainable yield, that the Commission must designate. At Honokōwai we’re already above 90% of the sustainable yield when you combine current use and authorized plan use. We also want to highlight here that DHHL’s reservation of 770.000 gpd of groundwater is included in the authorized plan use figure. Also, Launiupoko aquifer, we were approaching 90% of sustainable yield. The table on the bottom left shows the updated twelve-month moving average for the month of August from 2022-2023. Groundwater use in Olowalu, Launiupoko, and Honokōwai increased. This is due to the fact that Launiupoko Irrigation Company and Olowalu Water Company have both installed pumps in their skimming wells to offset stream water use. So, LIC’s skimming wells is one of the ones discussed earlier that was in the fire- impacted area and the reported water use in July from that well was 1.243 mgd. This shows the pending well applications that were included in the table on the previous slide when we calculated that 90% of the sustainable yield was being reached. Just want to highlight here that the pending well applications on the bottom for Pulelehua 1, 2, and 3. These wells are intended to serve the affordable housing project of Pulelehua. The six drinking water purveyors in West Maui, there’s a total of six private water companies that provide potable and non-potable water. We just want to highlight that Maui DWS accounts for only about 23% of the total water use of West Maui. The resorts in Kapalua and Kāʻanapali are served by Hawaiʻi Water Service Company, see in the center there. One of the reasons for designation was that there are users on the Honokōhau Ditch that take prior to the Maui DWS water treatment facility in Māhinahina. With water use permit allocations, the Commission can ensure that Maui DWS will receive its water that needs to serve its end uses. This slide is also from last year’s June submittal. It shows the water system sources and uses in the area. All systems, Maui Dept. of Water Supply and the private water systems rely both on ground and surface water. We just want to highlight the blue sections here. These values have to be updated as Launiupoko Irrigation Company and Olowalu Water Company have both installed pumps into their two skimming wells and now have two well sources each. The sections in yellow are end uses of the Honokōhau Ditch which show available flow under Q50 or median and Q90, low flow conditions. This is just a map to show the complexity and the interconnection of ground and surface water between the hydrologic units from Honokōwai to Honokōhau via the Honokōhau Ditch. Now, we’ll talk about water use permits. Again, the effective date of designation for the Lahaina Aquifer Sector Area was August 6, 2022, which means that existing users had one year to apply from this date to file a water use permit application with the Commission. Water use permit applications were due on August 7th, but because the 6th fell on a Saturday, users were allowed to submit their applications on the following Monday, August 7th. The Commission sent out two notices, one via registered mail to all existing users who declared their uses, had registered stream diversions or well, and people who had obtained stream diversion works permits or well construction pump installation permits with the Commission. To give you a brief rundown of the timeline of the Water Code suspension by the Governor’s Emergency Proclamation on August 9th, Lt. Governor Luke suspended the State Water Code in response to the fires and this was part of the 3rd Proclamation. On September 9th, Governor Josh Green reinstated the Water Code in the 7th Proclamation for the wildfires. We want to highlight that the designation of the Lahaina Aquifer Sector Area remains in full effect at this time. The Commission staff at this time has begun inputting the Surface and Ground Water Use Permit applications for existing and new uses into our system, but we’re proceeding cautiously and proceeding slowly out of respect to the Maui residents that were affected by the Lahaina fires. At this time, we’re holding off processing. As I said, we are moving slowly in this matter because we’re not certain who exactly has been impacted by the fires. As we’re reviewing the applications at this point, we’re slowly starting to reach out to the applicants. This next table summarizes all of the permits that we’ve received as of last Friday, September 15th. The top row is the total number of applications we’ve received. Of course, G is for ground water use permit applications, S is for surface water use permit applications, E is for existing use, N is for new uses. Just another look at the next system, Ukumehame in the south. Just shows the water use permit applications that we’ve received for the integrated surface and groundwater units. This map shows the well and stream diversions in Ukumehame. Followed by a summary of all the applications that we’ve received. The blue are for existing, the green tables are the new uses. Next for Olowalu, again you can see the ground and surface water sources in the hydrologic unit. This is a summary of the applications we’ve received. This is for Launiupoko, Kauaʻula, and Kahoma hydrologic units. This is one of the more complicated regions that we’ll be looking at. Here are the groundwater use permit applications for existing use. Here are the groundwater applications for new use and the surface water use permits for existing use. As well as a handful of new uses. Lastly, moving into the Honokōwai, Honolua, and Honokōhau aquifer and surface water hydrologic units. These are the groundwater applications for existing use. Just a note here, TY Management Corporation did submit information, but I believe it was in support of Hawaiʻi Water Service’s application. A handful more of existing groundwater permit applications, one new use application, followed by the existing Surface Water Use Permit applications. Again, these are surface water use permits for existing uses in Honokōhau. Continuing Honokōhau and one new use application received. With that, we’ll move into water resource alternatives. Any questions?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I’m sure a lot of people here are waiting to hear about what happened with the Emergency Proclamation and the suspension of the IIFS. From my viewpoint, whatever happened, it went around the wrong way. If you’re going to be using off the streams, first you have to look at the fact that interim instream flow standards were set, which said how much water you can take off the stream. Rather than suspending the IIFS, what should have been seen as a competing use and if any water was going to be used for emergency fire or for in the future, putting water in the reservoir for fire. If it's going to come out of anything, it should have come out of the other users because these are competing users and the Commission has set up priority designations. So, all I’m saying is in the future, if the County is serious about setting something up like that, the County should apply for a permit and we should deal with it in the usual way as we do for permit applications. If there’s not enough water for all the people applying, which seems to me that’s what’s happening already, then we deal with that and that process. Not just saying, “Oh, we suspend the water and the stream flows and take it out of the streams.” That’s the wrong was to do it.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Going back to last November, because of the potential fines to Olowalu Water Company, we instructed them, and Kaleo Manuel was critical in negotiating a settlement where the moneys would not just come to State coffers but go into the improvement of the system for the benefit of the public trust as well as the benefit of Olowalu’s own customers. Was that done?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Ayron, what was the status?",0,C1,09/19/2023
Wasn’t the reservoir for capture and storage?,0,C1,09/19/2023
That one they had to do in three years. They had to get back with us with their plans to complete the work within three years.,0,C1,09/19/2023
They repaired the dam.,0,C1,09/19/2023
And they did restitution for the cultural area?,0,C1,09/19/2023
"They have been providing in-kind services, including the use of industrial woodchipper for the cultural lands to utilize. They have also been providing the staff to operate it. They first started work on the dam itself, fix the leakage, repair the dam to provide for fish passage, and meet the instream flow standard. That’s what they’ve done up to this point. Their second or third phase will be to, assuming, drain the reservoir, dredge it, and repair it.",0,C1,09/19/2023
They’re acting on that?,0,C1,09/19/2023
"Your view, are they acting with the same urgency they’ve asked us to abandon policy? Are they acting equally urgent with their own investment opportunities?",0,C1,09/19/2023
I can’t say one way or the other. We don’t have the ability to keep tabs on them more than every so many months.,0,C1,09/19/2023
"When you look at this list of applications, there’s a lot of business and land-owner interests here. And yet when I see the testifiers for this hearing, all we see is the community. So, if this is of such concern to them, if they have such interests in the outcome, where are they?",0,C1,09/19/2023
I can’t speak for them.,0,C1,09/19/2023
"Maybe that’s not a question for you to answer, but I mean are you in discussion with them outside of the hearing structure to really get them...these were people who opposed designation in the first place. Now they say the urgency of the wildfire risk means we should get rid of designation, we should eliminate instream flow standards. Where is the testimony to explain to us why they feel that’s necessary?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I will state that we were in communication with regards to Olowalu and we’ve received an update via letter, written form, on the status of all their projects two weeks ago. As it applies to Kauaʻula, we had a stakeholder meeting with affected parties in Kauaʻula in July. We’ve been working towards a resolution that protects public trust uses.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"When I think about why we should designation an area, you’re just supporting designation in those comments because when a community can’t come together in and of itself, it needs somebody to help them. I want to commend our staff and the team with Kaleo’s leadership, as well as your own work to help do this, to bring the parties together, to really put a list together that doesn’t favor one party. It lists them all and allows us the opportunity to balance. The message needs to get out to the community that somehow doesn’t want to be here that they need to show up to if we’re to balance their interests. What’s your timeframe for bringing your applications forward?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"We anticipate it’ll be a while. There’s over a hundred applications, we have to review it, recognizing we do have some staffing limitations, so we do have to prioritize. Also, we do need to take them to public hearing. If we go to public hearing and there are any objections then we may be in a contested case hearing format at that time, which means we’ll have to reassess whether we combine them all or not or take them individually. At this point, we’re just starting to review the applications, starting to process them, and it’s hard for me to give you a definitive timeline at this point.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"If I can just add, I’ve met with CWRM. The fires have really sort of refocused our attention to rededicate to prioritizing. I want to reassure everybody that the water management area designation is effective. We are in no way going to withdraw that. It is here, we’re moving forward with that process. We want to be mindful, CWRM may end up doing more outreach to the community to try to, as you say, see if there’s...I think Kaleo was really good at that, was really good at doing those conversations to bring competing interests before they come to the Commission. So that makes Commissions’ lives a little easier. We want to emulate a lot of that process that he’s been doing and make sure that we honor that process because I think that really does help. Again, we are trying our best with the capacity that we have, but also the priorities that we have given the fire. We are trying very hard to work with DWS and that’s going to be the next presentation. What are some of the other options we’re looking at. One, we are challenging both CWRM and DWS, how do we create this infrastructure so that we’re focusing and utilizing public lands and not having to look at private lands so we have more control of the distribution and the allocation. We recognize that this is not an easy issue. We recognize that we need to be more mindful and thoughtful to this community. Everybody on Maui is sort of in a state of limbo so we don’t want to push anything, but rather work with the community when they’re ready. Our staff is just in the process of gathering all the permit applications, reviewing them. We would like to keep the Commission updated. This was intended to be an informational meeting, informational briefing only, no action. But really give you an update, as well as give the community an update. I say the same thing you do, Neil. Show up. If you really have concern, you got to show up and if you don’t, I mean there’s different reasons, but show up and participate. I would urge everybody, again it’s not only participate before us, but when we’re looking for funding at the Legislature. Mahalo to Senator Fevella for being here and Senator Keohokālole for being here earlier. We really need to work with our elected officials. I appreciate everybody who’s here today, but staff is working diligently as they can to try to keep this process moving forward. I just want to reassure everybody here that the staff continues to work to proceed with the designation process. Nobody has told us not to do it, so we are continuing to work full speed forward.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Dean or Chair, I just want to make a request that there’s been discussion or requests to have the next meeting on Maui. Just as we had requested the Navy’s presence quarterly to give us updates, I think it would be highly appropriate to request that over-represented private interests in ground water, which we know feeds the streams, to be present. I say this because the reason why designation happened was because IIFSs weren’t working because the violators, including many of the applicants for...I guess my understanding of West Maui Land Company is it has many subsidiaries including Olowalu, including Mr. Tremble whose name I remember from that violation, were part of the group that were sort of spurning the Commission’s orders. They were not, at least in earlier points in time, making good faith efforts to cooperate. I think carrot or stick, I think that designation sort of brought out the amount of resistance to cooperating. The narratives, last night I was going through my notes from June and back then there was the pleading to slow down, to slow down on designation. It was moving too fast. Climate change wasn’t an issue. Oh, there’s plenty of water. There’s no disputes. We can handle it on island. And yet the evidence sort of pointed elsewhere and that’s why we listened to evidence and took that step. It’s hugely disturbing and made me physically sick to see those letters from Mr. Tremble. Interestingly cc’ing an affordable housing official on a firefighting issue requesting a policy roll out. And, I just want to say I think we as a Commission have extra work to prove that we are upholding State Code and it’s obviously shaken people. I miss Deputy Manuel because he did do a lot of lifting and it means more work for us and we’re just going to have to saddle up and do it, but I would request that we not be afraid to ask people to do their part. If we are to kahuwai pono as a Commissioner, it’s not Deputy Manuel and he would say this. It’s not seven of us, everybody. And especially it’s not the people who have to take off work to come fly over, but the people who have been the beneficiaries. I don’t want to demonize anybody, but we want to give people the encouragement to do the right thing. Maybe it takes more nudging. I have a toddler, I have to push him to do unpleasant things like brush his teeth. Obviously I’m speaking out of frustration. I think we can be a little more creative, assertive, and clearly with 277 pages of testimony, there is a pleading from the people we serve. I know we can’t meet outside, we have to hold things in Sunshine. Let’s think specifically about ways we can restore the public’s trust in our ability to mediate this really complicated issue. I’ve talked to my students in class, Lahaina is our Colorado River. We’re going to have to think real hard, use all the tools we can, technically, diplomatically, and whatnot to make it work. Thanks for letting me soapbox for a minute. I do think having the applicants or at least inviting them directly to be present at our next meeting would be helpful. We also need to hold a space where it’s not going to become a yelling match. That’s on us as the Commission. Let me know how I can help with it.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I appreciate that, Aurora. I do want to just address two points that you made. One, with respect to Mr. Tremble, CWRM, I have sent a letter out to him that the IIFS...he needs to comply with that. That the initial letter that I sent him, now that the Proclamation has been changed to unsuspend 174, they need to comply. Two, with respect to why isn’t this meeting on Maui, I will share with you that was our initial thought. But we did receive a letter from, in my mind very credible cultural practitioners who are from Maui who asked that we not hold the meeting in Maui for September, but we consider holding it in October. I honored and respected that request. We will try to be in October, come to Maui and hold the meeting there. Hopefully it’ll be advertised and all those who may be impacted by this designation will show up and will share what they have to share. We want to be very sensitive to this community. I appreciate all of who you have shown up. Those of you who have to pay on your own money, your own time, taking off work. You’re dealing with your own loss to come here because this issue is so important. Clearly the CWRM staff and the Commission, we greatly appreciate that you’ve taken the time to do...it’s obviously a really important issue to you and I think that helps the Commission put in perspective. If it’s important, you show up. So again, I appreciate that.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"You cited the letter, correspondence between you and Mr. Tremble and there are two other things I observed about that. Number one, you came to our Deputy’s aid and honor and defended his performance and so did Mr. Tremble, he said he was a man of integrity. When I consider that and the testimony we’re receiving, that number one we’re understaffed and number two that he was very competent in his work, that’s what leaves the public so perplexed as to why is he not there. You’ve declared it to be a personnel matter which we respect, but we’d urge you to consider that in your personnel review that he was considered effective by both sides of at least this issue. I think we could look to other parts of the State and say the same thing. Number two, we need the help. We need bodies on board who can hit the ground running. Our hope is that this is an expeditious review and that someday soon we will have a confident player back on the field.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I’m so old with this Commission that I was on the original Waiāhole case and many of you know how long that dragged out. Given the complexity of the Lahaina designation and the number of permit applications, I expect something like that to happen. Sorry, but I don’t think we can make final decisions on the permit applications because somebody will object and ask for a contested case and when that happens, everybody who is asking for permits cannot afford to not participate. It’s just a practical warning that this is going to drag out a long time. I think the sooner that we can process those applications, the sooner we can see the pathway to finishing.",0,C1,09/19/2023

"Is it the chat? I will ask all of you on Zoom to not chat because it is a Sunshine violation. I apologize to you, I know you want to ask questions. We are going to take questions very soon or comments, but I would ask you that you not chat on the Zoom. I greatly appreciate that if you can honor that. I don't want this meeting to be where we have to stop it.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"With that being said, we’re going to move to the last section of this presentation which is a presentation on water resource alternatives.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Thank you, Chair. Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Branch. At some point in a few days post disaster, we were tasked with exploring how best to support the infrastructure needs of Lahaina with regards to water and whether that was related to developing a plan that identifies important surface water sources like reservoirs that could be utilized for firefighting capabilities or what other infrastructure needs the community might have to expand water use. This is a little bit out of what I would consider our wheelhouse and that we are generally regulators and protectors of resources and not developers. But understanding that we have the best on- the-ground knowledge of how these resources are integrated and the infrastructure that exists and the knowledge out there, we came up with a few alternatives with which the state might be willing to invest in to expand the availability of both potable and non- potable water, knowing that both are going to be critical moving forward to meet domestic water needs to meet the water needs of potential housing projects as well as the irrigation needs of the region. Whether that's for agriculture whether that's for a green belt whether that's for redevelopment of wetlands, you name it. I'm going to go over two alternatives that we have summarized here. The first option is the expansion of R1 use. We've talked about this for a number of years that this is going to be a critical component of all water resource strategies in Lahaina. The expansion of recycled water use distribution and reservoir improvements are going to be articulated and then option two, repurposing existing sources or particularly Honokōwai Development Tunnel sources. As you know the Lahaina Recycled Water Reclamation Facility exists in Honokōwai. This option one, I've identified a number of benefits including increased, storage of recycled water for distribution, reduced reliance on surface water for non-potable needs, reduced groundwater injection of recycled water, and increased storage of non-potable water for agriculture and firefighting capabilities. The existing Water Reclamation Facility gathers water from Lahaina all the way up to Nāpili. This is the County's infrastructure map right here with the Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation facility in the middle of that map. Then the existing distribution system or at least what was existing two years ago. This is the existing distribution system map. Most of the use is in Kāʻanapali with the golf course and some landscaping irrigation demands being met. There is a pipeline that uh transmits water to a reservoir within the golf course on the right. I wish I had my pointer. Then recently the County has purchased the Honokōwai reservoir at the 300-foot elevation which is on the left, right there. They've tested out the pumping facilities and they can get water to that elevation and they are working on expanding the distribution from that reservoir towards new users in that region. Historically there was a pipeline from that reservoir up to what's called the Field 140 Reservoir at the 700-foot elevation with which Maui Land and Pine blended that water for agriculture irrigation. That pipeline is no longer usable but replacing that would be a tremendous benefit and replacing the pumping infrastructure to get water to that elevation would allow for the distribution of recycled water throughout Maui Komohana. This is a bird's eye view of the region. Lahaina Wastewater Reclamation Facility is down in the bottom middle area. The Honokōwai Reservoir at the 300-foot elevation is identified right there, thank you Dean. Then the field 140 Reservoir is at about the 700- foot elevation along the Honokōhau Ditch right there. The County's Māhinahina Water Treatment Facility is located just to the left of that location. Then there’s also, the state owns Lower Field 14 Reservoir which is just above Field 140 Reservoir. The Field 140 Reservoir is currently owned by Maui Land and Pine but is another opportunity that the State or County can invest in to store recycled water. The Honokōhau Ditch ran all the way to Kahoma Gulch, essentially and Wahikuli Reservoir via crossing Wahikuli Gulch and Hāhākea Gulch. Wahikuli Reservoir was decommissioned by the state a number of years ago, but it still exists. It's just not connected to anything. It could be repurposed to store recycled water. It could be downsized to reduce seepage. It could be lined. There are a number of opportunities that might exist to improve storage of non-potable water in that area. I drew a line on the ditch just to show where it exists there are a number of siphons across Honokōwai Gulch that could be slip lined with a R1 pipeline. I believe Department of Health guidelines require a closed system for recycled water utilization, so we'd have to run a pipeline from the reservoir through or alongside the ditch to other end users. This is just a repeat of the existing pipeline that occurs up to the 300-foot elevation and then we need a new pipeline up to field 140 Reservoir. This is an overlay of the region with land ownership. Kāʻanapali Land in purple, the State of Hawaiʻi in blue, and Maui Land and Pine in that dark brown, and Kahoma Ranch in the light brown. As you can see, one of the complexities of this issue is that the ditch itself crosses multiple landowners, so rights of entry or easements would have to be obtained, but that there are potentially a large number of non-potable uses within this area. Here's the Field 140 Reservoir when it was full about maybe five or six years ago. This is the inflow from Honokōhau Ditch. This is the other view looking mauka of the reservoir. This is Honokōhau Ditch along the side. Then as the ditch drops underground and then pops out at the siphon. This is where infrastructure would need to be improved to get non-potable water that's temporarily stored in Field 140 Reservoir southward. Here's a look at the Honokōwai Gulch at the siphon and this is where historically water would cross Honokōwai Gulch or when there was no need for it, might be discharged into Honokōwai Gulch which that does not occur anymore. Here's the historic picture of the flows from the ditch into the siphon. On the south side of Honokōwai Gulch, this is what the ditch looks like. It's primarily lined in certain areas, at least as it runs through Kāʻanapali Land Management. The pipeline for recycled water would probably have to be separate from this flow of water which originates in the Honokōwai mauka area. Then as the ditch passes into State lands there was less investment in it and the ditch is not lined so again a pipeline would be preferable. Similarly, as the ditch crosses State lands. Two of the biggest issues are the crossing of the gulches. Wahikuli Gulch is relatively shallow so flume was utilized. That flume would have to be repurposed for recycled water distribution. Then Hāhākea has a siphon, but that siphon leaks and so it would have to be slip lined. There's leakage on the left-hand side. If you look closely that's when there was excess water. In Kahoma, we have Wahikuli Reservoir which is owned by the State which could be repurposed to store recycled water for the region and then a new pipeline that crosses Kahoma Gulch and Kanahā Gulch which follows the existing Lahaina Pump 2 Ditch. Could be utilized. That ditch still exists through Lahainaluna High School and then runs along into a property owned by Kamehameha Schools.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Here's land ownership of that region. Kamehameha Schools is in the pinkish color and the State of Hawaiʻi is in the bluish color and then West Maui Land or Makila Land is in the purple color. Again, the Lahaina Pump 2 Ditch crosses multiple landowners, so Rights of Entry would be necessary, but the ditch itself exists um and a pipeline could be easily placed within it in this region. It at least could terminate at Makila Reservoir in which it could be utilized throughout the Launiupoko region to offset surface water resources. Here's a picture looking mauka and Kauaʻula, the ditch is running left to right. That's that line of boulders. The ditch is about six feet deep in this area. It's dry. It's been dry for some time. This option there are a number of pros and cons I've identified: old pipeline stitches and reservoirs are already in place which is Pro. You don't have to build something from scratch, it could be a gravity fed distribution system once water is pumped up to the Field 140 Reservoir. We get increased storage of R1. It's at an ideal location or elevation to support firefighting and agricultural needs in the region. We don't have to deal with instream flow standards. The County can if they were to be the manager of such a facility, could charge for non-potable use and that money could help support the maintenance of the system. It could repurpose the decommissioned Wahikuli Reservoir. Again, ideally located for firefighting and agricultural needs. Cons are that you need to purchase Field 140 Reservoir, the Honokōhau Ditch crosses multiple privately owned parcels, and multiple gulches to cross adds cost to engineering, although at this elevation is relatively accessible. That's option one that we came up with. Option two is repurposing existing groundwater sources. Up in Honokōwai at a pretty high elevation there are multiple development tunnels that discharge directly into the stream and the benefits identified by these groundwater sources that, direct availability of potable water for the region. We know potable water is in high demand. We have housing projects that need to come along and we need to offset the availability of water that might not be there from surface water resources. It is also at a high elevation such that water could be gravity fed into any system across the region. Where is this located? In Kāʻanapali Land Management's region above Kāʻanapali development is our two reservoirs, Horner Reservoir and Hanakaʻōʻō Reservoir which are fed by the Honokōwai Ditch. The Honokōwai Ditch originates at way up in the gulch. It was captured surface water from Kapalua and Amalu historically as well as development tunnel water. There are two development tunnels, Development Tunnel 20A which is on Kāʻanapali Land Management land, discharges approximately 2 MGD, but again it varies over time. USGS and CWRM have made the following measurements and ranges from 1.8 to 2.5 approximately MGD. A pretty substantial flow of water discharges from this tunnel and this discharges directly into the stream and is captured by Honokōwai Ditch. This is the interior of the tunnel if you've never been there or have any desire to look into a tunnel. 20B on the other hand is on State land. This also feeds the stream and is captured by Honokōwai Ditch, but this is owned by the State. The tunnel discharges directly into the stream. This is what it looks like in the interior. We've made fewer measurements, but the following measurements somewhere around 0.5 to 0.8 mgd or so of flow. Again, that could be utilized for potable needs if needed. This is standing on Honokōwai Ditch intake or the dam in the gulch. The Honokōwai Tunnel 20B is immediately across the stream channel in the middle of that dark section, if you can circle it...right there, that's the tunnel. It's really close to the start of the ditch which means that there's very little infrastructure that needs to be placed within the Gulch itself. The ditch starts at this location and immediately goes through tunnel all the way and pops out above those previously identified resource. Here, this is the start of the ditch again just within 50 feet or 80 feet of the development tunnel which could be relatively easily repurposed for drinking water and you could run a pipe through the ditch so that we can separate the potable from the non-potable water. So here's the map of the ditch itself and as it crosses State and Kāʻanapali-owned land, any potential potable water system would then at some point after the portal of the tunnel, could be connected to the County's drinking water supply, for example. The pros and cons of this option, groundwater source is already developed. It's already dug, no need for a permit to drill a well, for example and it's reliable, anywhere from 0.5 to 0.8 mgd or so. Water could flow by gravity to the County system so you don't have to pump it from this elevation. It reduces cost to operate the tunnel. 20B is on State land so permitting might be a little bit easier or whatever. Instream flow standard does not have to be modified and we can meet potable needs for DHHL or other new developments in the area. The cons are the pipeline would have to cross some privately owned land and access is a little bit challenging to run a pipeline through the tunnel, but it's doable.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I mean when Ayron says he was tasked right after the fire, I pulled all of CWRM together and said, let's be part of the solution not the problem. I would tell you within a couple of days they came back and impressive so we've shared this. They've had discussions with DWS, they're exploring this. I mean when we look at is something that can be optimistic. I mean this is two, this is a potential source and we tried to focus on where can we provide DWS water more efficiently rather than having to go through private purveyors. We do have land issues, but for the most part this is an available source. I applaud CWRM. They took this seriously. We're also looking at, can we get monies for infrastructure to accomplish what they... Again, working with DWS to explore this as a viable option to provide a solution that can supplement some of the realities that we're facing. I'm very impressed with CWRM staff that quickly took on this challenge and are continuing to explore this with the right people.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Chair, I join you in commending staff. Ayron, you called them options not alternatives, so you could actually do multiple, you can do them both. Is there a case for using the power of eminent domain where if a landowner resists allowing an easement for this critically important infrastructure that's needed for the public interest, is it possible to use eminent domain to acquire that easement?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"You know I’m the stream guy. I would say it's up to the County because it would ultimately have to be County infrastructure. They would have to be the manager, owner of whatever was constructed. I'm assuming it would be part of DWS’s system so they would have to address that.",0,C1,09/19/2023

"When you look at the resources of insurance and FEMA and philanthropy and so forth that's coming into the scene right now. If they could see the impact of investment being really a long-term improved use of water and mitigation of the risks for wildfire because you have less land in fallow, weed production, and more land in active productive use, that might be a compelling impact for both the insurers and the federal government and FEMA and philanthropy. We might consider making, I don't know who makes that case, but we might put that together so we could actually have both.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"We came up with the idea, but we're looking to the County to implement because we really want them to be the end users and distribute. It's consistent with their legal mandate that they have under the court order with respect to R1. We recognize that the county was challenged with their immediacy, but we knew that...I tell you we've got the best staff, so tasking them with providing the County some options. But you're right I think we could do both, we could do both.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I guess my comments are one where each of the alternatives, I think you need to identify Champions because I think that's critical in how we put it together. For option one, what would really help me put things in perspective is not only land ownership but land use overlay. That would address the benefits of how much R1 water would be used both short term as well as in future development and putting in place things like greening off places to mitigating again, fire control. In option two, the development wells, is that the horizontal well? Okay. We've been through that ad nauseum and got it and you're right, should be portable water use long-term, in fact, near term. Is there a third option in how you capture high flow uses? You demonstrated Q50 flows and you have these spikes. Is that a low hanging fruit that we can address?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"Definitely, I think it was an option we explored especially when it came to...the County has very little storage of non-potable water that then could be treated for potable water. They have two potable water treatment facilities, one in Lahaina, one at Māhinahina and those rely on non-potable water to be converted into potable water, but there's very little storage of that. In discussions with them, the available storage that would be able to gravity feed water to the Lahaina Water Treatment Facility, for example is in the 8-to-10-million-gallon range which is fairly small. For comparison, the Olinda Water Treatment Facility is somewhere around 130 million gallons of storage so it might not, unless we were to totally rebuild a brand-new reservoir or repurpose Wahikuli Reservoir and pump uphill because the Wahikuli Reservoir is at a lower elevation than the treatment facility. There isn't the existing storage infrastructure that would make it worthwhile for potable water needs.",0,C1,09/19/2023
But isn’t that sort of a low-hanging fruit where you can now actually construct reservoirs that make sense for servicing existing needs as well as future development?,0,C1,09/19/2023
"Knowing the costs that it takes to take one of these 100-year- old falling apart reservoirs and upgrade them to meet dam safety standards, the financial benefit is limited from a private owner's perspective.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I would suggest that that's why you make a new one if that conforms to what we need and where we need it. I know that agriculture has placed their reservoirs where they needed it historically, but I think that has changed. I think all of these options are needed to be done together. Great presentation, thank you.",0,C1,09/19/2023
I just want to build on that because the barbell mentality of it's either for commercial or it's philanthropic or government responsibility is kind of archaic. There's many things that are hybrid these days and this is one of those things. There's a measure of contribution and of an investor for which they're going to get a reasonable return and then you're addressing a public trust interest so there's an interest of government or philanthropy to support that. It's going to take a little bit different kind of deal making mentality and approach. We put the funds together that's necessary and not be stopped at the gate because we can't get an investor to do it or we won't use government money that's going to have a private inurement to an investor. You got to get past that to kind of more sophisticated deal structure.,0,C1,09/19/2023
"We have submitted a request as part of our FEMA package for purposes of water resources and so you know President Biden has given us an opportunity to put in. With the options that CWRM has come up with, now whether they get submitted as part of the package is another thing, but we have submitted all of those options to the governor's office to be included in his package. I think they are they're vetting all of that, but you know I think the challenge is we have to be part of the solution and we need to start looking at alternative sources. Drought is inevitable. The Drought Council just met about a month ago and we hadn’t met for like, since five years. The trend is we're probably going to have a very dry, dry winter and we're not going to even have a wet season, then we're going to go into a dry summer again. It is only going to get more challenging and difficult for us. Like I said, greatly appreciated CWRM, totally embracing the task, taking the challenge with recognizing, let's not look at where we've got...it's going to take us permitting. What can we do with what we've got available? These were really viable options that utilize existing infrastructure. Paul, anything?",0,C1,09/19/2023
A matter of money.,0,C1,09/19/2023
"Yeah you're absolutely...and the will to do it. I also think we need to create incentives for our partners, private landowners to see the benefits of this. I think that we are, the Water Commission when where we're in a unique position. I think the foresight of the Commission to do this designation does put us in a position to look at the entire system as a whole and all of the resources that we have available. Again, I want to reiterate this designation, we're still moving forward. Now we have other options to consider as part of that designation. The timing unfortunately, the fires, but we know that fire suppression, the servicing of our traditional customary practices, and other needs, we're going to have to find a good way to balance that. I don't know what the solution is but we know that we have to look at this comprehensively.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I have a question for Commissioner Ho and maybe you can answer it and maybe you can’t. I understand wastewater and drinking water regulation is under DOH. What do you see as like maybe the hurdles that we need to consider or the players who need to be engaged, in addition to the infrastructure and landowners? What do we need to be thinking about?",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I would say that yes, indeed DOH has to be in coordination with CWRM staff on these options. I think they should be talking to each other. For me, I would have liked to at some point in the future once all of this is fleshed out to see a recommendation from CWRM staff about this, in addition to costing it out. Because we always have to balance that we have limited resources. I would like to see that at some point in the future before we come to a resolution on that. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak, also. I recognize that we all, the Commissioners, have comments but I also want us to be cognizant of the fact that we have 277 people who have submitted testimony on this exact project and so to the extent that we can keep our Commissioners comments to a limited so that we can hear from the people.",0,C1,09/19/2023

"With respect to Kaleo, I think the Chair is listening and will take the testimony under advisement, thank you Keola for that opportunity to set this up, but I was jotting some notes that what do we make of all this today? One of the things Iʻm hearing is todayʻs public testimony constitutes the filing of a complaint about a CWRM permitee. Peter Martin doing business as Kahoma Land, Makila Land, Launiupoko Irrigation, Olowalu Water Company and so forth, that heʻs abused the public trust asset thatʻs in our charge, that heʻs denied at times the rights of beneficial users of that public trust asset, that he deliberately distorted information that created about our policies in the exercise of political influence for personal gain, and fourth that he maliciously defamed the character of a dedicated CWRM public servant whoʻs just dispatching his duties. That to me, the sum total of this testimony today is a complaint that if somebody were diverting too much water, if somebody did something they werenʻt supposed to do against our policies and interests, we would pursue that complaint, investigate it, and then there would be action and recommendation back to the Commission. Iʻm not sure, do they need to put this in writing or does this hearing constitute the filing of that complaint? Whatʻs our process for this?",0,C1,09/19/2023

"Kecia Joy Marine biologist for over 30 years, resident of Maui What does Chair feel she needs to do to regain the people’s trust? CHAIR CHANG: For me, it’s continuing to do the good work of CWRM, it’s to empower the staff to do the work that Kaleo established the foundation. It is to continue to ensure that that legacy, the community engagement, the Ka Paʻakai analysis. I want to be very clear that Kaleo brings value to CWRM staff and to the Commission. None of that is being diminished by the actions that I’ve taken. But I also realize that Kaleo is a part of a larger team. Right after the fire, CWRM, they mobilized to come up with some options. They immediately went out and did some good. So, when you ask me what am I...it is to ensure that the good work of CWRM continues, that we meet with the Water Commission, and that we continue the good work. That’s my response to you. Thank you, Kecia. Do you have any intention of reinstating Kaleo Manuel?

I am in no way diminishing or disparaging Kaleo Manuel. He probably has been one of the best water deputies...I knew Linnel Nishioka. I felt Linnel Nishioka, she was a great deputy. But Kaleo has provided Hawaiians who have been disproportionately impacted by Water Commission decisions. Kaleo has brought parity to that, undoubtedly to the dismay of others. Through his sensitivity as a cultural practitioner, through his knowledge on Ka Paʻakai, Kaleo has brought that equity back. He has given the voices that have not otherwise been heard in the Water Commission. Please do not take my actions in any way as diminishing the good work of Kaleo Manuel.

It doesn't mean that it’s easy. I share similar goals like Kaleo. The opportunity to provide a platform for communities who have not otherwise had an opportunity to speak. Land Board, we’re doing a lot of informational briefings, even CWRM. Informational briefings with the Navy. My feeling, as a community organizer, it is informed decision making. I want people to know that I don’t make decisions without thinking things through. We may disagree, but I do appreciate the candid opportunity to speak.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I want to build on this commentary, though. A couple things, when things don’t appear logical, people get cynical. Right now, that’s where we are. In the absence of information, things get made up. Secondly, one of the reasons you used to justify the personnel move, is you trying to protect the work of the agency. The work of the agency is not protected by this. This is, as Isaac has said and I fully agree, this is an inflection point. I’ve been in an organization that’s lost trust and had to work really hard to rebuild it. We lose the trust that Kekai talked about, our work is going to get really, really difficult and the progress we make is going to be really, really challenging. The divisions it creates and the animosity within our community is going to be really, really bad and the threat to the resource that we are sworn to protect is going to be jeopardized. It’s a lot to lay on, but you’ve embraced this. You’ve embraced this responsibility. Just know that it has those kinds of consequences.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I’ll break silence, I guess. Fully knowing that this is my first term and I am looking to serve again, but perhaps keeping quiet for the sake of that is not worth it. I’m uncompensated, I can’t be fired, I’m a volunteer. That gives me a little bit of freedom and in addition, I’m an academic and I’m used to using that ability to speak freely. Yes, I don’t have tenure. But what’s the sake of staying quiet if all you do is holding out for five years until you have some job security. Life is too short. You asked, Isaac, is this an attack on the Commission? I think with everything we heard today and everything I’ve been watching from the IIFSs, from designation. What felt like real violence when Kaleo was redeployed, especially seeing it from the back end. There’s a lot, maybe I’m still too emotional to share, but I understood that his reappointment was not straightforward or easy. I understood that he felt like he had to navigate the transition and this is my first time navigating an administrative transition, so I thought that was sort of normal. It didn’t necessarily feel healthy. When I was forwarded some of the correspondence, it was alarming and concerning. And it shook me because having watched the governor’s vetoes on the water bills that were really in response to work I had helped with on Red Hill and the permitted interaction group and questions we had that were unresolved by the AG, seeking clarification. There were the vetoes, there was the emergency housing EP that sort of raised questions on how our operations and the Commission would be affected even though 174-C was still in effect. His redeployment for me was sort of this unbelievable view of tampering in the work of the Commission. At the same time, we saw how many people came today and that they didn’t come to designation willingly, it was because that was the option that they would have to go through this onerous process of applying for permits and being regulated. Nobody likes being regulated. Navy doesn’t like being regulated, the Board of Water Supply doesn’t like being regulated, nobody likes being regulated. We get that, but they were willing to do that because it would create a more equitable power landscape for water. And I hauled my books, Water Conflict. It’s not just about water, it’s not about wells, it’s not about streamflow, it’s about power. We know this locally that water conflict is about power relationships, sorry I’m processing aloud here, but it was so very stark to me of what the power landscape looked like on August 16th, a day after our last meeting. Where it was so stunningly normal after a horrible, front Civil Beat article and it felt like incredible whiplash to have just received a notification from DLNR news, Dan Dennison, that our deputy was redeployed. We didn’t have a say in that and this is just my personal experience on it. I raised questions and I did not get any answers and then there were other answers that were sort of in the news about investigation. All to say, I think regardless of what is Kaleo, I think the bigger question is, what does it say about our governance? Our water governance but governance in general. We have people who believed in a process, who were onboarding who are suddenly feeling very betrayed. I watched betrayal with Red Hill, how Navy, people who spent their life working for the Navy felt betrayed. But this is a different kind of betrayal because people were just starting to believe in the system. Yes, we can treat Peter Martin as watering lawns as a waste complaint, but I think there are bigger issues at hand that don’t necessarily happen through like HER 13-whatever. We should each think about and Kumu Vicky Holt Takamine’s question too about or other people asked about what are we doing? Chair Chang, I know you said it was your choice, but I as a Commissioner also feel like I did not perhaps in those times in the immediate aftermath speak up. Isaac you were like, why is it silent? I didn’t speak up because I didn’t know and I didn’t know what to say and we didn’t know what was happening. Now I’d like to speak up and you know, we can make bad decisions in the heat of the moment, but also I’ve been called out on them. Halealoha Aiau called me out and then you mihi (repent). This is just me not being a bureaucrat, but that’s how you start to work on the trust. The Navy recognizing that, yeah we screwed up, but it’s going to be a long road and we’re going to be held accountable. The concern to me is always when people stop showing up to the meetings, that they’ve given up on you. Right now, people are showing up, but when we stop seeing people, that’s when they think governance has failed them. Our systems of governance work when people believe in them, when they engage in them. I think that’s what’s at stake. Hearing from staff, hearing from everybody today, yes there’s a personnel issue, there’s an investigation, the AGs publicly saying it’s going to be a long time, at the same time there’s designation, and yes, we want to move forward. But how do we move forward if we don’t have capacity and definitely how do we move forward if we don’t have that ingredient that allowed people to trust the Commission, that ingredient being Kaleo. I personally, I’m thinking about the individual statement of support, I may draft up and put in writing. He was serving as Deputy before I came in and so I have this expectation of the momentum of the Commission...it’s like we shifted from fourth or fifth gear to first. The way I take it is, Kaleo was pulling a lot and it’s going to be on other people to do that work and maybe it always should have been. I don’t have any good closing words, but I appreciate the opening for talking because people don’t understand that government is not some blob, government is people and we can also make mistakes, but we can also rectify them. I appreciate there being room to figure out how to rectify that. We’re getting specific recommendations on how to do it. Maybe we can’t follow that recommendation, but we can work on solutions in the spirit of because I think we need the capacity, the facilitation capacity and skillset that Kaleo had and I don’t know where we’re going to find it. Definitely need it for West Maui, Maui Komohana.",0,C1,09/19/2023

"Mahalo to everybody who’s been a part of this today. Dawn, your grace in accepting and receiving really pointed criticism is remarkable and only matched by your persistence in doing something really stupid. I feel like I’m talking to somebody who’s in a car ready to drive down a busy street, you’re going to hit somebody. You’re going to hit somebody and they’re going to get hurt. I don’t know whether to yank you from the driver’s seat or flat the tire of the car, but that’s what I see. We’re headed in a really bad direction. I know if I try to offer right now a motion to agendize to support Kaleo’s reappointment, agendize that, AG will say no because they’ve taken a position that this is your deal. Until that’s resolved in the courts, that’s not going to go anywhere. What I think I can do legitimately is we have an agenda, we’re going to meet on Maui next month. I don’t know what the agenda item is, but you need t explain, somebody needs to explain how we’re going to rebuild, restore trust in that community. That needs to be on the agenda. What’s your plan to drive down this street and not hit anybody, let alone be headed in the right direction. For our community, the evolution in my time, it’ll be 50 years next year working in this Hawaiian community and to see the change in the staunchness and the engagement is just like lightyears, lightyears how we’ve grown. Just really proud to be a part of this. When I crystalize that spirit, I thought of a quote of Frederick Douglas fighting for the abolition of slavery in 1857. I just shared this with another group. He said, “If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing of the ground. They want rain without thunder and lighting. They want the ocean without the roar of its waters. The struggle may be a moral one or may be a physical one and it may be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you’ve found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted.” Our people are past the point of resistance, so expect it and fueled by that spirit. Anything less would be accepting injustice. Anything less would be walking backwards and losing the progress we’ve made. They’re not going to let it happen. Let’s do the right thing.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I got this job in July of 2021, I think, and shortly after that, we had the Red Hill in November. It was Department of Health right away, day two of the incident said, don’t drink the water. The Navy that day said the water was safe to drink. I recognize value of water, but I also recognized we issued an emergency order to shut down Red Hill, but it was the collective voices of the people of the State of Hawaii that came together, that really solidified the closing of Red Hill. I applaud you for that. It is the collective voices of everyone coming together for a single flash point, in this case there were four flash points. People coming together as a unity to bring your voices to the body to help us make decisions. I also really respect you Dawn for carrying that burden and it is a heavy burden, I know, because I had to take decisions against my employees as well. It’s a difficult task and I know that it is a tremendous burden on you and I know you’re going to do the right thing in the end. Thank you everybody for coming and for sharing.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"I appreciate all the perspectives from the testimony today. I’ve been experiencing it through my own window, but in three, four, multiple dimensions now. It’s clear that there’s been a lot of pressure on you, Chair Chang. But as Dr. Scheuer pointed out, this preceded you and the whole incident took me back multiple times to the Lahaina Designation Hearing, and so coming out of this today, there’s a couple things that I understand need to be done. I’m sorry, I forgot your name, there were lots of names today. But the social media aspect and the things that I am not aware of. My students yesterday were explaining Tik Tok to me and I’m still wrapping my head around it, but just how much certain messages travel and how information is so different than how I gather it and how you guys understand it. Yet, that’s the reality that so many people live in, is through that. What I’m getting to is, I get now that my silence is not okay because if something were to ever happen to Kaleo, that’s blood on my hands. I’m feeling motivated to write a public statement of support. I think it would be stronger coming from the Commission and we don’t need to necessarily talk about the personnel issues, but I am feeling highly motivated to explain also the work of the Commission and why he was instrumental for that progress. He set new bars for what Commissions could and should do in terms of upholding the Water Code. The other thing I’m thinking about too, thank you Dr. Scheuer, is that whisper network. Another way that information gets out and if you are in PRP or the carpenters union, that is your reality, that designation equals a housing moratorium. That we need housing more than ever. I don’t know how to engage that conversation, but I would be very, very interested in engaging directly with, I think specifically it’s PRP or carpenters union. Understanding what are the anxieties and let’s address those because it doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. I think especially Lahaina forces us to see that that’s not true. But other than saying it’s not true, well then how do we make it not true? How do we address those concerns that so many people, I’m learning this, on Maui are contractors and so they do rely on that income stream. If we aren’t building, then what are they doing? What are their job opportunities? Window washing at the hotels? How do we address the economics? It comes back to, I’m going to get academic, but there’s this idea of three modes of governance, it’s an oversimplification. There’s the bureaucracies that we exist in, but there’s also the market. I hate economics, I don’t like to think about it, but the reality is it has a lot of power, and the housing market is definitely interacting with our water situation, especially on Maui but also Kona. Then there’s civil society and it’s sort of a triad and I had the privilege of speaking at the West Maui Speakers Series on Zoom back in April. It’s clear it’s lopsided. The idea is a three-legged stool, the bureaucracies, the market, and civil society. What we see is civil society coming up to rebalance things, but it also requires action on all of these other modes of government and coordination. How do we take some of those ideas, really actualize them to help us solve our problems? I’m deeply interested in seeing how to make that happen. I’ll think more about it on how we can engage or ask around on how we can engage this housing-water conversation and get past these either-or binaries because it’s harming people who have good hearts. Thank you for the opportunity to share that, put ideas out. Maybe other people have better ideas that can help us move the needle.",0,C1,09/19/2023
"This is not easy. I cannot even begin to imagine how Kaleo feels, I cannot. Let me just address this, several things. One, it’s never been CWRM’s intention or directives to in any way blame the kalo farmers for the fire. That came out as a Civil Beat article in light of the correspondence that was made. That has never been a narrative we at CWRM have ever supported or advocated. We continue to support the IIFS...Proclamation 7, I will tell you in a conversation with Kathy Ho, clearly we could see the division in the Hawaiian community about the suspension of 174-C, the suspension of the IIFS, the threat of the West Maui Designation being withdrawn, created a tremendous amount of tension, contention, fear, anxiety. Everything that was said here was at threat so long as that suspension was in place. Through a conversation with Kathy Ho about how do we address this? I approached the governor, and I said continuing to suspend 174-C is only going to divide the Hawaiian community soon after the BBB mess. I said I would urge you to consider unsuspending that. Fortunately, he did. My determination to redeploy Kaleo was not a unilateral decision. That was a request I had received from the Attorney General’s office based upon an investigation. But I made that determination, not the Commission, I did not confer with the Commission, I did not confer with anybody else. I told Laura Kaʻakua being the Chairperson is probably one of the loneliest jobs you have. It’s not like you can share some of these decisions, but I do own that decision. And that was based upon a request that was made to me based upon an investigation. I will tell you, I had to think about what was in the best interest of the department, including CWRM, contrary to what we heard today that many felt that that decision put at risk everything that CWRM has done, all the trust. I recognize that, I recognize that, but having Kaleo continue to be in that position would have put a cloud over Kaleo, would have put a cloud over everything that CWRM did. I recognize that some of you would disagree with that. Understand that that wasn’t an easy decision, but it was one that I shared with Kaleo. I also realize he has been in a tremendous amount of pain because he has not been able to say anything. I appreciate you bringing to my attention the social media. Like I said, I can never imagine how difficult this has been for him. How painful it has been to be personally attacked and not be able to say anything. Neil is right, silence gets filled with a void and that void is going to be filled with misinformation and it creates that opportunity. I think you need to appreciate the position that I’m in. There’s an ongoing investigation. I have to be very careful about drawing that line and people may not appreciate that, but that is something that I have to consider. Being the Chairperson has been the best job. This has been my dream, but it is also the hardest job. My children have to call me every single day, are you okay mom? Are you alright? You okay? I’m good. I am so grateful for the opportunity to serve in this position, I truly am, but it is a very difficult position. Sometimes you have to make hard decisions that people do not agree with, I get it. I have heard every single person who has spoken today. I’ve heard the concerns, I’ve heard the voices, I’ve heard the emotions, and I’ve heard the heartfelt plea to make it right. I want you to know that I’m going to take all of this. I’ve heard you. Nothing has been wasted on me. I thank all of you that took the time to stay here with us, to provide us information. I recognize that something has to be done before October when we go to Maui. I don’t know what that decision is going to be, but I recognize something needs to be done. We are planning our next meeting to be on Maui. We’d originally planned this meeting to be on Maui. I will tell you, I greatly appreciated a letter that came from Keʻeaumoku Kapu...and Kapua mahalo for giving me the...Keʻeaumoku Kapu, Archie Kalepa, and even Kekai, asking me to hold it on...now they could’ve raked me over the coals on social media and say, see how insensitive this Chairperson; she goes to Lahaina and didn’t she feel what we? But they didn’t. They trusted enough to reach out to me to ask...that to me, I will tell you when I received that, I wept because it was so significant that they could have taken a different route. They could have just said, see look at her, she don’t even care. I am tremendously grateful for their reach out to me and to make that personal plea because I know that they didn’t have to do that, but they did. We responded and they came in full force today and I am grateful that they all came. They took time off and you’re right, at a point in time when many of them have lost their homes, they’ve lost loved ones, they’ve lost their community, but they took time to be here because they knew how important it was. I get it, presence is important and I knew how important it was. I heard their overwhelming plea and cry to reinstate Kaleo. I heard that, I heard that. Please know it has not gone on deaf ears. I have great aloha for them for making that gesture and for physically being here. I am grateful to all of you for staying as late as you have with us. I don’t know what’s going to happen in October, but I do recognize that there’s an expectation that something will be done. All I can say is I understand, I’ve heard everybody, and thank you all for being here. Thank you for your courtesies to me and to the Commission.

Informational Briefing to the Commission on Statewide Drought Conditions,0,C3,11/21/2023

"I'll just briefly add. The Drought Council hasn't met I think what was it, 2017 was the last. Then we came onboard and after Neal suggested we should really reconvene this group because it appears based upon National Weather Service, Kevin Kodama predictions, we're going to go into a much drier season. This was even before the Lahaina fire and then the Lahaina fire came and it's become even more apparent, the predictions are I would say dire. It looks like we're going from a dry summer, fall, winter, spring and then going back into a dry summer. I think what was particularly alarming, at least for me, was hearing from Maui County, Upcountry Kula when we maybe about two months ago we were talking to John Stufflebean. They had 30 days of water left because they are dependent on surface water. Two of the three wells were dry because the water was just not flowing into the streams, the one well or the one facility Kamole. The governor's office asked CWRM and DLNR, is there anything we can do as a State agency and what we realize is they are really challenged because they're at capacity. It's not as if we could amend IIFS or amend the water permit. EMI, they're giving the county the water that the county can put into their Kamole facility. This is really real and Hawaiʻi island is taking a proactive approach. They're talking about a water conservation campaign, Keith is looking at doing more education but he sees it as well especially in the Kona District area. We did as a Drought Council suggest that perhaps the Governor and the mayors can get together with a collective message about water conservation because we know that with the drought is the inevitable cycle, dry, we’re going to be more vulnerable to fires, invasive species come, and it's not going to get any better. I think we're looking at how do we change people's behavior to become much more aware of water is a limited resource. We've seen that in Red Hill, we're seeing that in Lahaina. We'll see what comes out of this but, I've come to realize several of the bills that were vetoed including House Bill 1088 would have positioned CWRM, the Water Commission in particular, to be in a position to declare an emergency and take appropriate actions. We are also discussing that with legislators as well as with the governor's office. I think the Drought Council recognized the fact that we represent different constituencies in the State of Hawaiʻi, that there's a common thread that weaves us together which is the public health and safety of the community and the protection of our water resources.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"If I can Chair, the only thing I’d add is based on predictions, the peak dry period is January/February. We're not even at the peak dry period or you wouldn't say peak but the lowest rainfall that we expected is in January and February. Now is really a time to start to be proactive in message in preparation for even more restrictions on water use or more limits on systems capacities and then also our role as a regulator of water resources. Right now you heard Maui and Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply looking at conservation efforts, but part of our challenge is also to make sure that private water systems are also carrying their weight through this drought season and are working towards conservation efforts. I think our strategy here is to get everyone on board whether on a private system or a public system. We have to get through this together in the next couple of months or hopefully couple months but it's kind of looking like it might be closer to a year. We might not get a wet season basically is what we're seeing so that's the only thing I'd wanted to add based on the conversations today.",0,C3,11/21/2023
I think that is important and that in my mind House Bill 1088 would have permitted us to bring in private purveyors.,0,C3,11/21/2023
"I don't want to see like what happened recently with Lahaina fire where there were moves to suspend the IFS when the proper way to go about it in a water management area which has permits is to prioritize the permits first before you start thinking about changing the whole interim instream flow standards. Even in places without water management designation there are priorities under the common law in terms of appurtenant and riparian rights which still have primacy and people can still take away water as long as those rights are not being affected. I think to the extent we can, we should try to predict or be proactive about who gets water first and who starts getting cut first and how you would distribute cuts if you have to rather than waiting for something to happen and then precipitately try to do something. I know it's going to be tough but the law is pretty clear about both the code and under the common law about the prioritizing of water use.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"It's good to see the coordination of these agencies and private players on the demand side. I can think of not just sitting and talking, looking at the information together but having collaborative strategies. Farmers in particular and ranchers choosing where they graze, how they graze, what animals they're using or what the crops are growing that are really predicated upon not what the rain they hope for but the rain they're going to get. The risks and using them to manage risk, I think is really important. Equally and I don't see it so much there on the supply side, if we believe our own ʻōlelo noʻeau “hāhai nō ka ua i ka ululāʻau,” the rain follows the forest. This should give impetus to our watershed partnerships and what they're doing, not only at the highest elevation levels of reforestation and dealing with the threats to the native forest but even down gradient. Really moving to every step of the way have agroforestry and understory that'll really optimize capture, minimize runoff and so forth. That combined strategy and having the public see the whole thing, not just their one little strand that they're passionate about or interested in. It's a holistic approach that needs to be understood by everyone in a holistic way. If the council could move in this direction, I think they could really promote a large public interest.",0,C3,11/21/2023

"I just want to say something because this is actually the field I work in, but for natural resource managers, too they're not going to be planting in a drought because the climate effects are getting stronger, but the emphasis on fencing because what's happening now is the goats are nailing whatever is left. If you want to keep the sediment you've got to manage the overrun. I was just in Kona. I do have a question related before you leave the seat on what's the status of our water shortage plans, in particular Pearl Harbor water shortage plan? Because we kind of left that off somewhere last year. I think we're going to need to call it back, including Honolulu water shortage plan.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"The Pearl Harbor Water Shortage Plan is as we left it, was approved. That is we haven't changed it. We've talked about going back and revisiting that in light of the Red Hill crisis. Honolulu Water Shortage Plan, that has not been done. We are thinking about doing that just because that's the other area on Oʻahu that has a lot of withdrawals and we do see some stress on some of the groundwater aquifers in that area, too. That's definitely something that we want to...hasn't been done. We do plan to coordinate with Honolulu Board of Water Supply who's come out with their own water shortage and recovery plan, part of it was in response to the Red Hill crisis as well. That's the status.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"I appreciate your point. Another example, dealing with axis deer. On Maui you're talking about the crisis of Kula, 30 days or whatever. How much of that is really exacerbated by the rampant population which is way over. It should be zero but even at a sustainable level, it's at the tens of thousands. We got to bring it down and that's where policies of both the Department of Agriculture...Whatever we can do on the ag side to foster more use of that asset because it is an asset and accelerate the decline of that population helps with the water.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"It's really sad on Molokaʻi in particular. We actually have a really good partnership with the U.S. DOD REPI (Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration) program and they have been extremely helpful in providing us resources for fencing. On Maui as well, DOFAW is actively and aggressively putting up fences as quickly as they can get resources to do that, so your point is well taken.",0,C3,11/21/2023
That's the value of this council. When you have the many stakeholders is not just to get the information but to really plan and collaborate coordinated strategy together.,0,C3,11/21/2023
"Since we talked about fencing and grazing, one of the tricky things and I don't think it comes up enough is that sometimes ungulates are your friends for fuel load. I know it's not within our wheelhouse as the Commission, but we have an interest in seeing the land managed a certain way. If there are ways that we can support or complement what's happening in DLNR and others, if that can come before us and we can be aware to support it even though it's not our decision.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"To get an informational briefing from them. DOFAW is actively managing the watershed with watershed partnerships but all of the different strategies...Michael Walker, they are the fire protection force.

Let's see if we can work that into our agenda at some point in time but doing a presentation by DOFAW on what they're doing both on ungulates, on invasive species, invasive plants as well as the different strategies that they're using.",0,C3,11/21/2023

"Remember the TNC publication about 25 years ago The Last Stand, The Vanishing Hawaiian Forest? It gave impetus to the rain follows the forest, the DLNR program. The back end of that included an economic analysis and I'm wondering if the time is now right to forge partnerships with our colleagues or other colleagues through Aurora at University of Hawaiʻi to do economic analysis of investment in infrastructure upgrades. That reservoir you pointed to, other intakes and so forth because we know why we want it. Farmers can't necessarily do it or land owners can't necessarily do it so how do we get that unstuck? I think somebody's got to do the analysis to show the return from the investment and also perhaps the need to get that return. Maybe there needs to be an infusion of grant money from either government or philanthropic sources as well as investment capital from that, but we can't just hope they see this. If we want to control our destiny at all we've got to help produce the evidence that'll help them see it. In the case of watershed conservation and so forth, we did that. It says, “you save this water here, this is the return you're going to get from its use” and so forth. It served a purpose in getting the investment in the watershed partnerships. Now we need to do it for water distribution and storage infrastructure.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"Two years ago, we did get a legislature appropriated $10 million for dams and reservoirs. It was a grant program. Unfortunately, they didn't provide us any capacity so we're going back to the legislature to ask. It actually creates a fund for private land owners to now apply for grants to restore their reservoirs or their dams because in light of what happened at Kaloko, liability concern is a mounting issue. Our engineering department, applying those standards, have decided what's high risk and you have either a choice to upgrade or remove.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"I made those decisions and spent those dollars and they're considerable, but it turns on some kind of economic analysis and we can give the environmental data and so forth but I think we need to couple it with an economic analysis.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"You're exactly right. For utility companies, public or private utility companies, they're limited in terms of their source of revenues, to revenue they get from their customers. They can't raise money for projects like this on a practical basis. That's exactly right.",0,C3,11/21/2023
Got some scholars over there who can help us?,0,C3,11/21/2023
"Not infrastructure. I'm thinking of who they are and I’ll see one who's guest lecturing in my class on Wednesday. I'll put that bug in their ear. I'll just say Kim Barnett has done work on this and Chris Wada out of Uyehiro and so it's time to revisit. Before it was Jim Rimiset but he's long retired. I have a question, thinking about the effort. So much has changed in the last couple months about what we think of as risk and where the investments need to be made. As we look at the El Nino development, we have our statistics for flows but we're already seeing that maybe we need to be more conservative in planning forward. Having been with you on the EMI looking at all the diversions, it was like a year or so ago, it occurs to me as flows drop and we do have some spots in the streams that are fed by groundwater, imagining future drying. We're going to have little pockets of ʻoʻopu graveyards in some places. So, how do we think about our IIFSs, if we are still updating them in these areas, to think about the populations of biota as a whole, regionally, versus stream by stream. I don't know if you've given thought to that, but how can we be of support thinking we're facing some rough couple of years, but I don't know the life cycle of different species of ʻoʻopu. Maybe a couple years can really take them out or maybe they can bounce back and they have refugia, but how do we need to be thinking about our long-term duty to supply people with water, to maintain our ecosystems, and then with the knowledge that you have about stream flows and El Nino projections, how do we put it together in an intelligent, more holistic way?",0,C3,11/21/2023
"We definitely consider ʻoʻopu source and sync populations if you know population dynamics. There are definitely streams that are sync population so we might supply an instream flow standard for the ecosystem but it's not a robust, abundant, reproducing population of ʻoʻopu as opposed to a different stream that might have different characteristics like an estuary or higher vegetation along the riparian zone or that sort of different structural characteristics that make it a more conducive location for a nōpili to be happy and reproduce, that sort of thing. There are a lot of questions still out there on what is actually happening in the environment. We have an instream flow standard at Honomanū, for example. Honomanū is a losing reach and despite it being a really important environment for ʻoʻopu and for cultural practices, it dries up naturally for months at a time now. I'm not making a recommendation one way or the other at this point but that environment, still what you want to protect for an ecosystem. Those are questions that we can ask. I think it's definitely worth identifying streams that have potential, whether it's refugia or source populations so that we can sustain on a landscape scale our native species and identify those high-quality streams and definitely focus your protection on those priorities. I don't know if that answers your question.",0,C3,11/21/2023
I think that's exactly the right answer and the answer that's headed in the right direction and that is to go through a categorization if you will of the streams and really ranking their productivity in terms of the environmental worth saving and should be cherished locations. Others perhaps need to be put more under harness under these drought conditions and extreme conditions we've got today.,0,C3,11/21/2023
"It's exactly how we approached East Maui, the EMI decision and order.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"It's a rationalization, but it's practical when it's going to be necessary.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"The East Maui contested case began that process of identifying streams but first time that they are actually coming up with good habitat information. You can't really try to restore all the streams, you got to pick the ones that are best. The people that live along the stream that you don't pick are not going to be very happy.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"It's a painful, difficult process.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"Just to add, you'll see a lag. The reported date is August so we're usually a quarter behind with for example the Board’s data that we get so we haven't seen the drought numbers reflected in these graphs that Ryan is sharing.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"Ryan, what’s the status of the Hālawa Shaft?",0,C3,11/21/2023
"That's a good question. For the Board of Water Supply, the last that heard from them I don't think they're going to bring that online for quite a while. They are looking at a lot of different alternative sources to supplement or to feed the system there. I think there's an ʻAiea 497 that they applied for. They're looking at various other sites but I think they have an application in for Waipiʻo Heights 3 and 4. That's kind of far though, that's in Waiawa so whether that's going to make up the water or those far farther out remote wells are going to make up the water for Hālawa or whether they're going to apply for wells closer to ʻAiea kind of remains to be seen right now. It's hard for me to comment on that. It's probably better addressed by the Board of Water Supply, but yes as far as Hālawa, I don't think that's going to be brought back online anytime soon.",0,C3,11/21/2023
Do you know what the reason for that is?,0,C3,11/21/2023
"Again, I can't speak for the Board, but I don’t think that they want to pump it at the quantity that they pumped it at previously because of the potential for migrating any kind of contamination over to Hālawa Shaft.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"Basically it's everything you all said. We cannot do business as usual especially watching the reports and seeing that it's all down. Some of them are past the warning and are actually approaching the critical and the fact that, what you all mentioned earlier as well with having the information between CWRM, BLNR as well as all these other entities that especially are focused on just continually developing whether it's master plans, these types of things really have to be taken into consideration. I do have a question for Ryan and then after that I do have one thing to add on to the Kauaʻi one. I was trying to look for the information but one question, Ryan. I noticed that the ‘Ewa Beach, Honouliuli, the millions of gallons per day is like 162 and then over the third 300. That reading I just want to know how, as we notice unnecessary watering of golf courses like for the Navy, that type of issue. How do also unnecessary uses like water parks especially with the flushing the system as well as the car system, the capstone, how does it specifically affect ‘Ewa Beach given these numbers that we’re given and the geology of the area? Then lastly is the Kauaʻi one. I can't find the exact number but I did see from last year May in Kauaʻi my testimony recorded and a side note is if this Commission as well as you know any commission like water commission on the other islands, do you all reread minutes of past meetings? Because you can learn a lot. I'm looking here that in addition to a lot of leaks, I think it was like 3 million total leakage reported for the whole year of last year in Kauaʻi and in addition they have billing issues and if you don't revisit them it'll be easily forgotten and you'll just be on a loophole dealing with the same thing month after month, year after year. So, to reread previous meeting minutes because there's issue of morale and for the employees, the billers but it seems that the engineers are the ones really on top of asking the right questions. Regarding over development, billing, leakages, and everything I think that would be good for this Commission as well as all water commissions on the specific islands. Those three points and then in light of the drought as well. Mahalo.",0,C3,11/21/2023
"Tara, I know you had a question for me. I think it's probably best and if the Commission agrees maybe it's best that you contact me directly. I wasn't quite clear on what your question was, but maybe if the Commission's okay with it, maybe it's best I put my email address in the chat. Maybe it's best if Tara directs her questions toward me?",0,C3,11/21/2023

"Representing EMI, the applicant for items B1 and B2 seeking approval of stream diversion works permit for compliance with the Huelo Stream interim in-stream flow standards. EMI understands the importance of the Commission’s decision and has complied with all permit application deadlines. The initial 13 priority permit applications are under staff review, and there are 14 additional modifications not covered in the current hearing. EMI’s written testimony addresses major policy issues, including the recommendation for the complete removal of some diversions. EMI argues that permanent removal is unnecessary since interim in-stream flow standards can change in the future. EMI agrees to abandon the use of diversions but opposes the permanent removal of structures, citing unnecessary environmental impacts and potential future reinstatements. EMI believes the policy of removing diversion structures should be applied on a case- by-case basis and limited to permanent abandonments. The environmental costs of removal, identification of alternatives, and impact on the water system’s structural integrity should be assessed. EMI suggests a non-uniform policy for every interim in-stream flow standard decision across the state. The permits, if approved, are subject to further reviews and potential conditions from other regulatory agencies. Additional studies and permitting requirements from county, state, and federal agencies could impact and delay the timeline.

"so, are you suggesting that the removal of the stream diversions triggers a Chapter 343 review?",1,B1,05/16/2023
"The necessity of permanent removal of the diversion depends on the decision of the commission. Suggests that permanent removal is not required to comply with the IIFS. Future changes are unpredictable, as exemplified by the repair of the damaged Kohala ditch and potential modifications to water usage standards. The legislature has appropriated a large sum of money to try to repair the ditch. The University of Hawai’i’s initiative to advance local food production emphasizes the importance of water resources for both domestic and agricultural purposes. Caution is advised to the commission, emphasizing understanding and compliance with the established IIFS, but questioning the need for permanent removal of the diversion to meet those standards.",1,B1,05/16/2023
this is more a comment from the actual words from our East Maui decision. Our decision will necessitate significant reductions in off-stream diversions in many streams. We are recommending no diversions of either base or total flow. Our order specifically identifies the desired streamflow expected. We recognize that a universal remedy to modify or remove diversions is not practical at this time. The commission’s overall guidance is not to remove diversion instructions if modifications from achieved desired results. I just want to provide that for context for subsequent discussions.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"as I look at the photos in the submittal, I'm looking at some infrastructure that may not last forever and if we don't remove them now do they continue to deteriorate? Ultimately, the use for which you're holding them at some unknown future date; they're really not prepared to meet those needs, so I guess Ken what I'm looking for is what's your rating of the life of this infrastructure? I mean it's served us well for a century how much more do you think it's going to last?",1,B1,05/16/2023
"it just depends, some by age and some by condition. I wouldn't say that there's a rating scale that we have but in working with the staff of the Water Commission for example, there was a diversion where the staff recommended removing all pipes but not demolishing the dam or the embankment. To be frank we're a little bit surprised seeing the submittal that it kind of changed. I think further discussion is necessary. Certain things like removal of pipes would do less damage than going there with heavy equipment and trying to hammer out that embankment where water can flow over it now.",1,B1,05/16/2023
in terms of your surprise Ken. Isn't it fairly standard in leases that the improvements that you put upon the land during the term of your use have to be removed when you return it?,1,B1,05/16/2023
"it depends. I'm not an expert on the land side but in DLNR I've seen where the land division has that option. If the lessee does not want to remove the improvements, sometimes they value their improvements and would like to keep it.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"Commissioner Hannahs Dean, I surmised that this is not the first time this discussion is occurring and that their feeling is that these have no use of future value for us.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"it's hard to say right again, as they did note in their comments that this is an interim in stream flow standard. Understandably I think we went through the same thing in the East Maui contested case hearing; whereas commissioner Buck noted should these diversions be removed or not. I think there may have been an oversight on our part being that one submittal was for modification and one submittal was for diversion and noting Division of aquatic resources comments about the two diversions.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"Let’s take them one at a time. The first item is specifically about modifications. So, in those recommendations, there is no recommendation for complete removal unless I'm missing it. What his testimony is referring to is item number two and maybe we should address B2 when we get there. Because it's co-mingling the issues. Before you are recommendations to modify which doesn't say the removal of the diversion it just says to modify to meet the IIFS. I think that would be helpful if we just take them item by item because the issues that are raised in Akinaka or EMI’s testimony is more reflected in item B2.",1,B1,05/16/2023
You would agree Ken?,1,B1,05/16/2023
"yes, and thank you for clarifying Kaleo.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"David Frankel representing the Sierra Club and submitted written testimony. Concerned about not receiving information in a timely manner. Requesting the timeline for system modifications from EMI, which is not posted on the CWRM’s website. Requesting notification to residents prior to impounding streams for their safety. Objecting to the proposed berms and lips as aesthetically unappealing and potentially ineffective during high rainfall. Supporting Dr. Strauch’s proposal from the November testimony and expressing alarm at EMI’s change in course. Raising concerns about the Ho‘olawa stream diversion and the need for a permit before installing a new sluice gate. Highlighting the drowning hazard near the concrete dam and advocating for its removal to create a safer channel. Noting that provided photos do not show the quantity of leftover pipes and debris that need removal. Expressing the need for these issues to be discussed in quarterly meetings to address them before reaching the commission.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"I’m sorry, I’d just like to note for the record. I just realized that the EMI written testimony was mislabeled. B2 should be B1 and B1 should be B2. I apologize.",1,B1,05/16/2023
question please for EMI. It sounds like EMI is ready to proceed with this work immediately and I saw in the submittals that it was an estimate of about six months to have the majority of these things completed. Does that still hold? That sounds pretty quick which is just great because get these interim in-stream flows up and running and have this situation restored. But what is the timing right now assuming there are no further delays?,1,B1,05/16/2023
"I would have to defer to the EMI folks, and I think they're also available but maybe if I could just reiterate it kind of depends on what the decision is and what kind of permitting is necessary. As we know a lot of times permitting is the thing that takes quite a while. But the actual work may not be that long. We have Mark Vaught also on the call so he could answer that question.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"I think the timeline for executing the construction of this would be six months to a year. I think that was what we had originally put down, but you know permitting time and weather is always the toss-up just depending on how soon you can get permits and weather permitting. Again, I think it's important to note that those are obstructions to the construction.",1,B1,05/16/2023
I guess it’s good we are heading into a drier season at this point.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"I have a question for Dr. Strauch or stream protection and management. It's a lot of technical information. I was wondering about a couple of things given the testimony from the Sierra Club and some of the comments from East Maui. When is the next meeting? It sounds like this was not brought up in the existing structures for dialogue. I've seen the diversions for three minutes and we don't want to be micromanaging it from Honolulu. So, what happened at the last meeting and when is the next opportunity for hashing out some of these understandings?",1,B1,05/16/2023
"I apologize for not providing the exact date of the last meeting. Since it was our first meeting after the responsibility of hosting quarterly meetings was transferred from the Land Division to the commission, the focus was on understanding the participating agencies and the general public. On March 3rd, we sent an acknowledgment letter to East Maui Irrigation Company regarding their two diversions. Two weeks later, during the East Maui company meeting, we mentioned that the applications were available on our website, but we didn’t specifically discuss the nature of the applications. The meeting was more of an orientation and an opportunity to get to know each other. I apologize for any oversight in not addressing the application details at that time.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"so, when is the next one?",1,B1,05/16/2023
"the plan right now is to hold it every three months. So, the next one is on June 16th and if it helps too Ayron does have some photos of each of the diversions and he can kind of walk through each of the proposed modifications for each one.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"given the feedback from testimony; it would be helpful to understand how the November decisions are tied to the recommendations, the logical flow, and understanding of the rationales because I think you've given a lot of thought to all of this, and youwe've worked a lot and have spent a lot of time on this, but I think we're not there with you, and the more everybody understands, the more people seefeel themselves in the solution.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"if I can, call on Dr. Ayron Strauch to provide some photos and walk through that connection.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"also, just to note in the submittal we tried to put the logic there above the diversion, so it shows what was discussed in November in the first box and then the proposed modification to show this is what we meant this is what's being proposed. If there is more cross-walking or further clarification, then let's go through that. Let's take some time to walk through it and make sure you feel comfortable with what's being recommended.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"I will do my best to walk through the recommendations, although I apologize for not knowing every detail since I am not the author of the document. Here are the key points.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"Recommendation H7 or Division 215 focuses on the Ho‘olawa Stream at Haʻikū ditch. The management goal is to increase flows in the stream for recreational and downstream aquatic habitat purposes. The stream has an estuary that enhances recruitment in the lower reaches. However, there are substantial overhanging bedrock lips following the rejuvenation phase of the Hāna volcanics that flowed downhill. Recommendations have been made to increase the base flow in the Wailoa, New Hāmākua, and Lowry ditches. The base flow should be maintained in the stream beyond the Haʻikū ditch. All the restored upstream flow should remain in the stream for riparian, recreational, and aquatic ecosystem values. To achieve this, the design of the diversion needs to be understood. The intake is on the right bank, and there is a gravel or trash rack in front of it. The stream acts as a gravel trap to keep debris out of the tunnel. There used to be a sluice gate that has been removed for the last five years. Lowering the invert of the dam in the stream and sealing the low-flow openings in the trash rack would ensure that the base flow remains in the stream and continue downstream. The proposed design includes a notch to allow the flow to continue. Releasing water through the sluice gate could pose a potential hazard for people recreating in the pool. If the sluice gate is returned and functions as designed, all the restored slow will continue through the proposed notch and not present a hazard. The dam is built into the bridge structure. The Ho‘olawa captures significant high-flow events, resulting in greater flows in the section, which may continue to be diverted. However, low flows will remain in the stream and pass through the proposed notch. Please let me know if you have any questions.",1,B1,05/16/2023
Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani on the submittal it should be “construct 45 inch wide or notch?” The submittal seems a little incomplete or I'm not understanding the terminology.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"Ayron if you can refer to the submittal page proposed action number four, the yellow hatched lines is what would be cut out of the wall to create that invert. Correct?",1,B1,05/16/2023
"yes, so that yellow hatching is the window with which all of the low flows will continue downstream. The lowest point in that window is the invert of the stream if we seal all of the pukas in the trash rack.",1,B1,05/16/2023
got it. It helps to have you walk us through this.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"so, Ayron. As submitted having heard the concerns of Earthj Justice and Ken, Akinaka on behalf of EMI. You're satisfied that what we presented here in the submittal is still recommended notwithstanding the concerns that may have been raised.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"correct. I believe that in order to retain all of the restored flow in the stream. We need to notch out the dam and allow that flow downstream. This allows EMI to divert some of those higher flows. But obviously, they will never be able to take all the high flows because those high flow events exceed the maximum capacity of intake, so just a small portion of those high flow events will be able to be diverted and all of those low flows will remain in the stream.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"and in this case, we are allowing infrastructure to remain in place. Where you are adapting it to our multiple purposes.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"I think we should just walk through each of them, so the commissioners know exactly what’s being proposed.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"Kaleo, I do appreciate the presentation of the logic. It does refer to the CWRM recommendation, specifically the November one, and what was recommended and how this action is consistent.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"we want to make sure that we are in alignment with the parts the commission gave in November. And if we're not, then this is a time to make any modifications or recommendations, so we are consistent with that intent.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"The Wailua Ditch intake 15 or diversion 185 is located at Kailua stream. Apologies for not reviewing EMI’s drawings properly, as I was more focused on the language. The proposed drawings do not accurately represent our intentions. The diversion captures all low flows, and the objective is to create a bridge or plate to retain the base flow across the intake. The proposed mechanism includes a metal grate, but filling the gaps with concrete and rebar may also serve the purpose. The primary need is to create a small berm on the upstream side to ensure the continuation of low flows across the bridge. The current depiction of the berm as a large structure is not accurate. My recommendation is to have a minor concrete lip, around two to three inches in height. This design would allow water to flow over the intake downstream. Apologies again for the staff submittal that fails to represent the design accurately. The use of concrete would be minimal and would not negatively affect the visual aesthetics. Properly designed concrete structures can withstand damage over the years, similar to other elements in the stream. The proposed berm would be a small structure, ensuring the uninterrupted flow of low flows across the intake downstream.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"before we continue, the proposed modification is a three-inch by 30-inch-wide metal plate. Would you recommend that the berms also be three inches high? We should add that clarification statement, three-inch berms.",1,B1,05/16/2023
as long as it meets the intent of the amount of water flowing downstream. The amount of water that the plate can carry is dependent on how wide the channel is. I'm confident they have the engineers to do the design and as long as the interim instream stream flow standard is met by the design; we can verify that in the field.,1,B1,05/16/2023
Ayron those grates look like they've been there a while. Do they factor into any of our goals or objectives for that stream?,1,B1,05/16/2023
I don’t understand that question.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"I get where low flow is going to go through that recruiting system where the low flow will stay in the stream, which is unobjective. But during high flow, those big grates like that pretty much dump into the diversion right.?",1,B1,05/16/2023
"a portion of the higher flows can be diverted. Kailua watershed goes up eight thousand feet in maximum elevation on Haleakalā. There are some big storm events that flow through this stream channel and in no way does this intake capture all of those high-flow events, but it will capture those medium-flow events.",1,B1,05/16/2023
I think you've addressed the point that I raised. I didn't quite raise the point as well as I wanted. That doesn't look like best practice; it doesn't look like the kind of stuff we want in our Stream long term. Aren't there better grading systems now that allow water to flow over as well as into diversions? This stuff is just going to break apart over time as it continues to deteriorate. Is this the moment that we see an upgrade or is that irrelevant to the purposes of the action?,1,B1,05/16/2023
"the question of whether this current design is going to deteriorate over time. I can defer to EMI in terms of the age which is the longevity of the structure. I don't know when this was last replaced, but I would assume many decades. Maybe EMI can comment on the age at which these structures are at this point.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"I apologize but I don't know the exact age of these. They are long before I started, which was roughly 30 years ago. These are 50-plus years old if not more.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"so, our recommendation would be to just leave them as is at this point.",1,B1,05/16/2023
the structure outside of the flow channel EMI repairs as needed. We don’t micromanage repairs like this.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"so, the feeling is it's a bit of an overreach for our interest. The in-stream flows standard, which is kind of the focus of our action to kind of leverage some improvements. That would make this a more modern system.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"I don't know what you mean by modern. This intake in particular has a control mechanism. When the Wailoa ditch flows exceed a certain capacity, it automatically closes a radial gate that discharges the water into the new Hamakua ditch. It’s a pretty cool design.",1,B1,05/16/2023
thank you very much Chair.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"The ʻOʻopuola stream at Spreckles ditch. The photograph in the submittal is somewhat misleading, and the concrete lip is positioned on the wrong side. From a downstream view, the right bank is covered in hau bush, with small wing walls and a grate where water drops through. Looking upstream, the goal is to restore flow in both directions. To achieve this, a metal plate or sealant across the intake is envisioned, similar to the Kailua ditch, along with a small berm on the upstream side. The existing wing walls have been there for many decades, and properly designed small concrete structures can endure in this environment. The stream management objective is to enhance aquatic habitat availability downstream, especially downstream of the center ditch and Spreckles ditch.",1,B1,05/16/2023
is there any language that needs to be amended based on your review?,1,B1,05/16/2023
"it says construct three inches high by 30-inch-wide concrete metal plate channel across the grate to pass 1.8 CFS. I think the three-inch high refers to the sides not necessarily the height of the plate itself. Maybe that’s an oversight, then install a concrete lip across an upstream- sided diversion. On page six of the submittal, the photograph and location of the lip is not correct.",1,B1,05/16/2023
but the language is correct. It is still upstream where the berm is. And the plate will accomplish the goal of connectivity and habitat restoration.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"thank you chair. I have two questions, one for Mark and one for Ken. Mark, could you address some of these safety issues that were raised by the Sierra Club in terms of notification of work? I think Ayron addressed the siphoning effect in the damning of the one diversion, but Mark would you address the safety precautions that will be in place?",1,B1,05/16/2023
I'm sure we can work out some sort of notification with a point of contact. The downstream residents of each particular stream; we've gone over this before. If there's enough water in there impounded that we release it that would put our employees in jeopardy that would put everyone in jeopardy so we don't plan to work in those conditions if the water is that high. I respect the Sierra Club’s mentioning that but I’m just saying that we wouldn't want to put ourselves in jeopardy as well as anyone else so those are precautions we would take.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"Okay, thank you, Mark. The second is really a clarification of the intent of the designs of the berms that were mentioned. What is the structural integrity that’s built into these designs? There was engineering to these submittals. You’re planning on having structures withstand a certain flow over a period of time. So, as you went through the engineering specs for the berms and the grates, what were the design criteria that were used?",1,B1,05/16/2023
"I wanted to clarify that when we talked with Akinaka about the criteria for the project, one of the things they mentioned was the size of the channel. If the channel is 30 inches high, that’s the entire height of the berm. We don’t want to put anything intrusive in the berm, so it will just be used to channelize the water into a certain location so that it can bypass the intake. Any flows that are consistently higher than that will have access to the grates themselves. Anything at a low flow will be channeled into the bypass channel and run through the link sets. I think the berm is designed to be just the same height as the channel itself.",1,B1,05/16/2023
and that has withstood high flow events over time.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"thus far, yes, we've had situations like that. We've used metal in the past and they have. But mother nature changes our minds daily, and she decides today's the day and then today's the day.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"at the next location, which is the same stream ‘O‘opuola but a little bit further downstream at Center ditch, the goal is to continue to retain all of that restored flow at the higher elevations downstream past the ditch. The intake is quite a wide structure and the upstream part of it has some pukas in it. The first step would be to fill in those pukas so that water doesn’t drain into the ditch inadvertently. The next step would be to build a similar channel across the concrete, which is the ditch itself, and over the intake structure. There would be a lip, which is very similar to the previous design. Then, a bridge or a plate would be used to convey the water downstream so that all of the base flows are retained in the stream.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"So, Ayron just really quick, similar in the proposed action. If we were clearer to say, install three-inch berms to direct flow in to channel that would make it more explicit about not being these huge walls as maybe the submittal originally depicted via image.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"yeah, unfortunately the scale of the design looks like they are quite substantial structures, but they are going to be non-intrusive visually. I don't think relative to the rest of the concrete that's already there.",1,B1,05/16/2023
that's just to make it explicit about what the intent is correct okay.,1,B1,05/16/2023
and then the last one. I think we have one more on this modification.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"At the center ditch, the Ka‘aiea stream runs underneath the ditch. On the left bank, there is a wing wall with a bunch of pukas that are designed to divert all the low flows into the ditch. Higher flows are diverted along the right bank over a little berm into an area with gravel, and then it spills into the ditch. The goal is to ensure that all of the low flows stay in the stream. The design is to notch out the upstream lip, create a channel across the intake, seal up all of the low-flow pukas, notch a section of the downstream wall lip, and then convey all of the low flows from upstream in the intake downstream without them being diverted. The low-flow channel is to be located at or near the lowest elevation intake so that all of the low flows remain in the channel and don’t get diverted.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"again, Ken. Ayron’s descriptions are consistent with what you are proposing.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"I believe so, Roy worked on a lot of the details with the EMI folks. Roy are you able to answer that question just to make sure that I’m not misspeaking.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"Ayron, it sounds like it's just a flat metal plate that you're looking to put across; and I guess is it going to be a little concave to ensure that the water gets past the grates?. I don't want to micromanage. I'm just trying to visualize what's happening.",1,B1,05/16/2023
any other questions commissioners?,1,B1,05/16/2023
"there are basically little walls; that's the three-inch-high reference. We don't want it concave in the sense that it would force all the water to flow into a somewhat narrow channel. Our amphridromous species are good at migrating small rivulets of water. They don't need a big flow, so the more spread out it is actually better for recruitment.",1,B1,05/16/2023
but we don’t have any spilling and over into-.,1,B1,05/16/2023
the wing walls keep it from spilling into the intake.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"sorry I don’t know the terms, if this were to be revised little diagrams that help people who need pictures would be really helpful.",1,B1,05/16/2023
see these little walls?.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"okay, that’s the three-inch thing, got it. Sorry, I was thinking the wing walls were part of the ditch.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"well, they do exist on the ditch. I just meant the walls on the plate.",1,B1,05/16/2023
mini wing walls okay. If just the simplified diagram so that it's in the record. So that we are all talking about the same thing and understanding and have the same picture in our head that would be really helpful.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"So, these images will be amended or appended to the decision that are presented here and will be part of the minutes. So, what we’re discussing hopefully, if recommended and amended; will all be recorded here with the intent. So, if it's not clear then let's make that clear before any action is taken.",1,B1,05/16/2023
any other questions or comments commissioners?,1,B1,05/16/2023
"I just want to go back to Ken's concerns. So, with regard to B1, your testimony regarding kind of resisting removing infrastructure doesn't apply. Am I correct Ken, because you're being allowed to leverage a lot of the existing infrastructure just to make a minimal adaptation to solve our purposes. But also have that infrastructure there for your needs as well.",1,B1,05/16/2023
that is correct commissioner Hannahs.,1,B1,05/16/2023
I would like to hear from David Kimo Frankel. Just thoughts and after hearing this discussion. Are there still the same concerns? I understand that the big thing is the notification and the quarterly meetings. But if you can kind of reflect back.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"this has been really helpful, and I think in terms of language. What I now understand is that the three-inch berm is essentially three inches higher than the metal plate or concrete. The way it's written in A and B submittal and as well as CWRM submittal is that the metal sheet and concrete would be three inches high which would defeat the purpose of the lip or berm because it has to be lower. Ayron has clarified this, but it would be good if that was more reflective in the decision. I appreciate Mark Vaught saying they never impound the water when they do these fixes. This provides a lot of assurance but it’s not clear if this is always the case. If the commission is on the same page that there will be no impoundment, then that’s great. This should take care of everything.",1,B1,05/16/2023
Mark did you want to clarify that?,1,B1,05/16/2023
just confirming. Mr. Franco is correct; the general idea is not to impound a larger amount of water and then have a sudden release because that jeopardizes not just downstream but our employees as well.,1,B1,05/16/2023
do you anticipate that there may be times when you might have to impound water that would affect downstream?,1,B1,05/16/2023
"no, what we generally try to do is create a bypass with some pipes and things so that the water can continue to flow downstream.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"Mark as I look at this picture on our screen and see those old-style grates. Are you familiar with the Kamehameha school’s Punalu‘u stream diversion,",1,B1,05/16/2023
Ken I’m sure is. They’re more modern aluminum systems that allow flow over as well as flow in and self-cleaning.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"Neil we'll continue with your questioning. I also want to note that Kathy Ho with the Department of Health just stepped in as well, but Joanna is going to complete item B1.",1,B1,05/16/2023
I just want to encourage EMI and Akinaka to look at some of the modern technologies available for in-stream diversion. The old grates were very inefficient and kind of greedy in terms of the water they took. And as part of the commission's record on the EMI decision we were encouraging modern investment to kind of make these systems more efficient and modern and safe.,1,B1,05/16/2023
any other questions from the commissioners? Do we have a motion?,1,B1,05/16/2023
"I just want to make sure the corrections are incorporated, and they were somewhat really detailed. I mean they're factual sort of language issues in the submittal. I don't think it makes sense to step through all of them so what options do we have?",1,B1,05/16/2023
"in taking notes while the discussion was going out while Ayron was presenting the only thing that wasn't consistent was the three-inch berms, the size of the berm was what we wanted to provide clarity on. I would just recommend for diversions w15 and C7 where those berms are being proposed; that we just amend the proposed action to say install three-inch berms.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"CI mean in terms of intent of what we're trying to do that's more of an engineering question. I think all the parties understand the purpose of that berm and it's not going to be something that is intrusive. So, I think the language as submitted I think we flushed it out through our discussions with all parties. I don't think it matters if it's three and a half inches or two and a half inches, but that berm would be put in place and serve the purpose of controlling the IIFS.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"maybe just to recommend if the modifications do not meet the IIFS obviously the commission set IIFS to be enforced. So, if the modifications as implemented do not sufficiently meet the IIFS based on our own monitoring then we'll come back to the commission and recommend further.",1,B1,05/16/2023
I agree that's a different issue I agree with that.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"can I recommend a revision that inclusion or clarification because when people are going to read this document as a public record, they may misinterpret it or interpret it as suggested but that is not the intent. B2 presentation will be attached but making sure that it's connected more meaningfully to the submittal would be helpful to reflect the clarifications that were made today.",1,B1,05/16/2023
and the minutes will reflect the clarifications.,1,B1,05/16/2023
I’m just thinking the public is not going to look at three different documents. They're going to look at one so help me out sorry. I'm not very experienced in this. What would that recommendation for revisions look like?,1,B1,05/16/2023
"what I’m hearing from Commissioner Katayama is he wants the staff’s recommendation to reflect the discussion and Kaleo’s clarification. If there is further clarification, we can refer to the minutes. I am concerned that if we are too detailed, it may be assumed that anything we don’t include was intentionally excluded. I think Ken, Roy, and Mark were all given an opportunity to confirm their understanding of Ayrton’s clarification. I'm not sure I want to get into too much detail unless the Commissioners feel otherwise. I understand that this can be modified right Kaleo.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"yeah, these are modifications. We're not abandoning it, there's still a relationship between the commission and EMI as a diverter.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"I'm also optimistic that there will be more quarterly meetings where the community will have an opportunity to be included in some of these discussions before they get to the commission. so, some of this can be worked out at that level as Dean described the first meeting. It was more of a meet-and-greet introduction setting. Parameters and then as they get into more regular quarterly meetings there will be more specific discussions on proposed changes. Okay Aurora, do you want to make something more specific?",1,B1,05/16/2023
can I make a motion to approve? But there are some factual text errors in this so with the staff correcting and clarifying those proposed actions if reflecting the discussions that had and also including in the recommendations that this will also be presented at the June 165th quarterly meeting but that's up for discussion.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"Chair that would be the second motion so either we're going to revise the first motion at the agreement of the person who made it and seconded. Then we can move on or dispense with the first motion and now deal with the second so, you have a motion on the floor.",1,B1,05/16/2023
"I had a motion from Commissioner Katayama. I thought it was seconded to approve staff's recommendation, but Aurora are you proposing a new motion?",1,B1,05/16/2023
an amendment that the staff corrects the submittal reflecting the discussion on B1 with the explanations given.,1,B1,05/16/2023
"so, Commissioners Hannahs and Katayama do you agree to the amendment? A motion has been made and seconded with amendments all in favor since this is our first motion. oh no we so all in favor say aye. The motion was approved unanimously very good. Shall we move on to item B2?",1,B1,05/16/2023
Modification of Existing Delegation to the Chairperson to Approve Well Construction and Pump Installation Permits and Other Groundwater Program Related Approvals by Limiting the Delegation to Certain Circumstances,1,B4,12/19/2023
"PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Ryan Imata, CWRM Hydrologic Program Manager Staff stated the summary request for the Commission to modify the existing authorization to the Chairperson to approve Well Construction and Pump Installation Permits and to continue pending application review and program-related approvals, statewide during the interim until a decision is made on Ka Paʻakai analysis requirements.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I do want to add some additional context to why this is coming before the Commission. Some of you have noticed I have a different style. I also have the unique opportunity to sit as a chair of the Board of Land and Natural Resources. Nothing is delegated to the division heads, everything is delegated to the chairperson if any at all, but in reading through I think all of us chairpersons bring different styles to the positions that we sit in. I come from a background of transparency, inclusivity. I think this body is a policy makers and I just want to make sure that this body provides us the guidance on what is delegated to the chairperson versus what needs to come back to the Commission. When I read through the previous delegation especially the 1997 delegation, that is over 15 years ago. Laws have changed, case laws, there have been numerous case laws and Ka Paʻakai is a relevant part in many cases, our analysis. When I look at the statute it also requires findings of facts and so I think that there are opportunities within the pump installation and construction where we can delegate but again I did not feel it appropriate for just me or Kaleo or CWRM to decide that. I really wanted guidance from the Water Commission as a matter of policy because as Ryan said majority of these are Hawaiian Paradise domestic single wells. I think that is appropriate for delegation, we don't want to hold anybody up but there are other… As resources become more limited there are matters that should be brought to the Commission. This really is the reason why it's coming is to get guidance from the Commission. I also have an issue with relying upon delegations that were made 25 years ago. I think that we should review these delegations on a regular basis. If things have changed then we should adjust, but that is the context upon which I had asked staff to review this. Commissioner Katayama at a previous meeting had also asked what's the criteria to determining what's delegated and not. Again that is the context, we're not trying to make more work for the water departments, we're not trying to create greater uncertainties but this is really an open forum to get guidance from the Water Commission helping us develop some criteria what is delegated to the chairperson versus what kinds of applications need to be reviewed by the Commission. That just provides some context.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Good afternoon Chair, Commissioners, and Deputy Director Manuel. My name is Marc Chun, I’m with the Board of Water Supply, Water Resources division. I’m here to represent the Board of Water Supply. First of all, thank you Chair as well as Ryan Imata for at least starting to address some of the things we have in here. That being said, I realize our testimony was just submitted, you guys got it this morning. So if you permit I'll just go ahead and read through the testimony.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Since I submitted at 11 o'clock last night I'd just like to read it into the record. It's very short, with your indulgence.",1,B4,12/19/2023
We did receive written testimony from Department of Water Supply County of Hawaii.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"Aloha Commissioners, Jonathan Likeke Scheuer for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. The chair of the Hawaiian Homes Commission, director of the department submitted written testimony last month on the briefing on this matter. We noted there that the only notice in non-designated areas as a result of this 1997 designation is through the Water Resources bulletin published monthly. There's significant lacking information in the bulletin and what appears, what doesn't appear, how we have notice, and even if we receive effective notice, whether any comment have any ability to be considered. The functional result is that for DHHL one of the four protected public trust uses of water in our State, that this has denied DHHL practical due process. Orally I gave you some examples of the deficiencies in the bulletin from the November bulletin. These are repeated in the December bulletin so I'd just like highlight a couple for you. The Kula 1800 #1 well, a 450,000 gallon a day well for municipal use was approved on the day it was submitted. The Puʻunēnē First Assembly of God irrigation well was approved on February 13, 1990 and the application was accepted as complete on January 10th, 1990. For municipal scale wells in areas where DHHL has proposed development but not sufficient water, there's an obvious nexus between the impact on our ability to deliver homesteads. I want to expand a little bit or maybe reflect on some of the things the chair just touched on. Since 1997 when the last time the Commission chose to consider the delegation of authority we've had the Waiāhole 1 case, the Waiāhole 2 case, the Waiāhole 3 case, the Waiola case, the Kukui case, the Nā Wai ʻEhā case, the Kauaʻi Springs case, Ka Paʻakai o Ka ʻĀina, all of which have contained very specific guidance to State agencies particularly but not only the Water Commission on your duties under the public trust, what public trust resources should be protected. As said on the first of those cases Waiāhole, in all areas without exception or distinction so they didn't say, oh you've got to protect it more in designated areas versus undesignated areas. The consequences of this delegation since 1997 has been there's been no meaningful opportunity for public trust interests or other members of the public to comment, no ability for competing rights holders to even have a hearing on matters, no ability to have a contested case, no analysis on impacts to public trust uses by the applicant or the agency. Just to be really clear a five-day pump test might be able to capture your impact on the nearby well, it's not going to capture any impacts on far away public trust resources and even when you do, within your records for a permit under a delegated authority when a pump was switched in the night Waineʻe A skimming well which is directly mauka of Mokuʻula, a five-day pump test was done, water levels immediately dropped next door to where Mokuhinia was and yet the consultant said, oh well I think there's other reasons why these are dropped. Even with the five-day pump test being long enough, the data was sort of portrayed in a particular way and of course because this was done administratively there's no opportunity for anybody who might be concerned about the restoration of Mokuhinia to have any role, any ability to comment on it. The short hand that I explained to folks around Hawaiʻi is that functionally because of the delegation policy it's as if the water code exists only in delegated areas. For the most part surface water a little bit more but for groundwater it's like we're still in the plantation era if you are not lucky enough to live in a designated Water Management Area. If you to try and defend or comment on a public trust use that might be impacted by groundwater development just does not exist so recognize having heard the comments from particularly Honolulu Board of Water Supply, there are some concerns about duplicability of having a well construction permit before pump installation permit. Those comments are well taken. Mainly what DHHL would look for is that we have these rights. A difficulty getting water to our lands, this process harms us and our beneficiaries. So to the degree people are asking for deferral or denial of what you're proposing, let's make sure we work together on how the opposition actually addresses these fundamental constitutional issues which thankfully the chair's proposed action is addressing.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Let me get this straight, you’re supporting the…",1,B4,12/19/2023
"The department is on record supporting moving forward with some version of the recommendation. If you defer, we would consider ourselves to be an essential stakeholder in the discussions.",1,B4,12/19/2023
You're not saying that this is rule making.,1,B4,12/19/2023
I am not saying that this is rule making. If the contention that this is a rule making procedure is true then one could fairly ask under what authority this has been done for the last quarter century which would expose a whole bunch of other things including existing people with well construction pump installation permits to questions on whether or not their permits were lawfully approved.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"I've got a question for Ryan and I agree that there should be a committee from this group. I think the more robust informative questions that you can ask those people who are applying, the applicants for these permits the better. In fact you have a more varied committee to actually decide whether to begin with the get-go whether these people, these applicants are actually who they say they are or if they're just coming in from another state or a foreign country under an assumed name. Whether they're here just to take the resources from our children and grandchildren because the Lord gave us this land for our children and grandchildren. That's basically what it is, not to be ripped off and taken by other people and at the moment that's what we see as a community in Kahuku and we're very concerned about it. Therefore your idea of the modification in the process really of giving out these applications of permits I think is a good one and it should be decided positively upon by another committee that you want to install. Thank you.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"This is a question for Ryan. I came in on the tail-end of Ota Well discussions but I what do recall hearing was that in non-designated areas part of the issue is that the cost of maybe utilities or the cost of drilling a well is very high so that waiting until the discussion of pump installation comes up sort of tilts the decision-making space in ways that can make it hard for the Commission to manage water in non-designated areas or deny a permit for instance, to deny a pump installation permit after a well has been constructed. Did I get that superficially correct? That was one of the arguments I recall hearing.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I will tell you that in 1997 we bifurcated well construction and pump installation permits and for that very reason that waiting for the pump installation permits was problematic. It was a consultant named Steve Bowles who's not with us anymore but he was advocating for the Commission to issue concurrent well construction and pump installation permits. One thing that maybe isn't obvious and I should have done better in making clear to the Commission is that when we issue a pump installation permit, it might be for a certain capacity pump but that doesn't mean that staff or the Commission or the chair or whoever has the authority is initially sanctioning that pump capacity. In fact in the delegation of authority to the chair to approve both the well completion report acknowledgement and the certificate of pump installation completion, that's dependent on a couple of things. First of all, compliance with our pump test requirements and then second, our assessment that that pump test analysis shows no adverse impacts to the environment. One thing, that I wanted to address something that Jonathan said about duration of pump tests. That definitely is a concern of ours and oftentimes what we do is if we do think that a longer study period is needed, one example is in Kohanaiki is that we require a long-term monitoring plan to look at water levels adjacent to the pumping station to see what long-term trends look like. The Commission does reserve the right to reduce the pumping at that pumping station over the long-term. We always have that ability so I think that we've developed a process that has been pretty efficient in terms of initially allowing somebody to put a pump in. We tell them you can put the pump in but if we don't sanction that pump size they have to take it out and put in a pump that doesn't have adverse environmental impacts during the permit approval process. We also reserve that right in the long-term. I think we have the authority to tell anybody that they can or they have to remove a pump and put in a smaller capacity if we start to see impacts to the environment at a later date. I know it's harder, there's some reliance on what pump is in the well but the Commission's authority is to protect groundwater resources. I hope that answers your question.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"When you say “we,” in the past has that been in front of the full Commission or has that been discretionary within staff?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Again, the delegation to the chair was to approve well and pump permits and to also approve the well completion report and the certificates of completion. It falls within staff's purview. What would happen is if the Commission was recommending that somebody have to downsize their pump and they object to it, we'd bring it to the Commission for full approval. I think the things that we are proposing and in the past have been approving ministerially have been things where we see no environmental impacts and there are no objections from the applicant but where we see that there are those kinds of almost discretionary issues that we need to be resolved, staff doesn't want to have that discretionary ability and we present it to the Commission for approval.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"For Department of Water Supply both Hawaii Island and Honolulu, you speak to the large issue but I'm trying to reconcile, calibrate your testimony with specific recommendations. With respect to each of these recommendations the individual domestic well construction, a lot of which are in Pāhoa, you oppose that or you're in favor of that? (BWS responds in the affirmative) Okay, you're okay with that. With number two, the individual domestic pump installation [inaudible] that are not designated, do you have a position on that?",1,B4,12/19/2023
Why don’t you come up to the table.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"Because it seemed like there's a lot more work to be done and the reason to have meetings but I couldn't discern whether you're okay with what's going on here, specifically what we’re recommending.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I'm Nancy Matsumoto. I'm chief hydrologist-geologist at Board of Water Supply, Honolulu Board of Water Supply and I work for Marc in the Water Resources Division.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"For instance with recommendation one, you're okay with that? Individual domestic well construction, well modification permits for wells for systems that are not in designated management areas.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Speak up a bit, I don't think Ryan can hear you.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Where estimated water usage as the date of the application is less than 70% sustainable yield, etc.",1,B4,12/19/2023
Our comments are just limited to the potable system that we operate so we're not really commenting one way or another on 1 or 2.,1,B4,12/19/2023
On 1 or 2 and 3.,1,B4,12/19/2023
3 is where we asked the question of the clarification of the definitions.,1,B4,12/19/2023
We didn't have a comment on that one.,1,B4,12/19/2023
If we supply the clarification on item 3 then you're okay with the submittal? With the caveat you think the discussion needs to happen regarding the issue.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"Our fourth comment yes, but also within our second comment we talked about that we didn't really have the comment on coming before the Commission for the pump installation permits but our comment was we think that the delegation to the chair could still exist for the well construction permit. That was the difference there.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"It's not specifically tied to these recommendations, sort of a side comment.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Which is my problem. This is what we have before us so you raised issues that are interesting but we're trying to deal with what we have before us. What I'm hearing, there's no real fundamental issue with what we have before us.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I'll try to help you guys and I'll try also to help ourselves here through this process. The Board has its own process in which it develops its own sources on Oʻahu and is unique. They operate within a water management area so they know that a water use permit is something that has to come before this body. What I'm hearing is that there's no opposition of coming before the Commission, there's going to be multiple bites of the apple including the pump installation permit and the water use permit; however, the way that the Board applies for permits is really unique and different than other applicants throughout the State. The board applies for a well construction permit in order to construct the well, test it, and determine its productivity. Based on that productivity they apply for a pump installation permit, water use permit at a later phase. There's no problem what I'm hearing from the Board to come back to this Commission. What they want to expedite and tighten the time process for them is to be able to develop the well, that that continue to remain administratively delegated to the chair to approve while the pump and the water use permit still come back to the Commission. Is that accurate?",1,B4,12/19/2023
That position is not in..,1,B4,12/19/2023
"It's not. Right now, the well construction permit would come to you folks for approval. this is how the Board uniquely applies for water use permits within this Commission. The context that Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani brought up for the Ota Well, they tried to do something similar and bifurcate. In that conversation because it came before the Commission, there was this detrimental reliance conversation that if somebody sinks a well for example, even the Board in this case that they've invested $1 million or $2 million into a hole and then if a permit comes before this body for a pump or water use permit and we deny it, it's like, shouldn't we have approved it holistically from well through pump through allocation? You're investing a lot of money at the front end and it puts this body in an awkward position to say, okay we did we invest $5 million or whatever you invest in the hole but we're not going to issue the pump permit. This is the dynamic that's at play right now within this submittal. Ryan is raising his hand. We could entertain amendments to this recommended decision, it could be specific to the Board's concerns in order to help support the Board in looking at source development. It could be specific for the well construction permit. I'd also highlight that where wells are developed also has potential impacts on Ka Paʻakai. Ka Paʻakai is not only pump related, it's actually the site of the well, the well source itself. It’s a complexity and layers of decision- making and review. I think aligning with Chair's recommendation is to have this conversation in public formats and sessions and not purely between staff and the Deputy. At this point in time that's what we're talking about today. I just trying to get you guys in alignment with what I think we're recommending. I'm hearing that you guys aren't represented within the recommended actions right now but this is part of the conversation if there's some something that needs to be discussed.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"BWS’ unique situation, is that provided for in our Administrative Rules?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"No, Administrative Rules, they're supposed to be applicable across the board no matter what, it's not specific carve outs unless we make it explicit in that rule making process but I don't think that's the intent of Administrative Rules.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"The question is, the complexities of this issue, can they be handled with a forum we’re in right now to add address their issue or do you need more time to really think about this and bring it forward?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I agree with you and I'm going to have to leave, sorry, but I'd like the Commission to think about whether we want to defer this matter in light of the late testimony and this discussion, whether we have enough information to make an informed decision. The second thing I wanted to ask is if we delegate and this is maybe a legal question, if we delegate to the chair is the chair able then to delegate to the deputy without a rule amendment? Is it the chair and her designee or his designee to make decisions? I don’t know, I haven't looked at the rules. I don't know if that's an issue but that came to mind as I was listening to this discussion.",1,B4,12/19/2023
That's part of the reason I raised that.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"Kathy, you’re of the opinion we shouldn't move on the four? There seems to be no dissent about this, it's just do we want to take up a fifth thing or do we want to bring that back in a separate context?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I leave it to you guys, there's a lot of discussion and I'm just not sure. I read through the submittal and then I got the late thing and I was a little confused about how it, but we have a quorum so you guys may be able to make a decision.",1,B4,12/19/2023
I'm sure there'll be more discussion.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"I'm a little confused about the differences between ‘97 and now. We've gotten through so much detail, it's been delegated to you before and this thing says we're going to delegate to you again, right?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I think it's different but I wanted to bring this delegation authority back to the Commission. The times have changed, we've got new case law, we've got a new Ka Paʻakai Analysis that to utilize the same delegation that we did in 1997 without really…Those don't come to me for approval, those are approved by the deputy director not by the chairperson.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"From what I understand, the ‘97 was a delegation to you. It just happened that it got then delegated to him, right? I don’t understand. I don't really see a big difference between ‘97 delegation and now. I think more or less now you want clarification not really a fundamental change in how things are.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I'm not sure, that's why I'm asking the Commission because I think there are questions related. Jonathan raises the questions about due process, most of the delegation is not conducted in open Commission meetings, that's handled by the staff. Many of these permits that are delegated don’t come before an open forum for public participation. That's the way the delegation has functioned and I would tell you I do have some concerns about that under Ka Paʻakai, under the new case law, under the Supreme Court's direction to us. We have to make findings of facts and in a delegation there is none of that.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"As I said I disagree on whether we need a full Ka Paʻakai Analysis on each and every decision we make and I don't think that Supreme Court decision requires that but that's a discussion for another time. From what I understand, I think you've addressed the concern about Honolulu Board of Water Supply, but now I’m totally confused about… Commissioner Ho leaves the meeting.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I can address Dr. Miike’s question about the difference between the initial delegation and what we're recommending today. I guess it's not really obvious and maybe that's my fault for not being super clear about the significant change in this. If you look at recommendations 1 and 2, those are for individual domestic wells and pumps and again this is in an effort to make sure that staff is not having discretion about things where there may be potential objections to. I'm not sure that the public has objections necessarily to individual domestic wells where the pump capacity is relatively small, rather we have applications in Hawaiian Paradise Park for water bottling or we have applications for uses that I'm not sure that we can apply reasonable and beneficial analyses to assess. I think that's the most significant difference between the previous delegation and today is individual domestic delegation whereas we take agricultural stuff and industrial stuff and everything else that's not individual domestic to the Commission. To address the Board's concerns, most of the Board's applications come to the Commission anyway because they are associated with water use permits. What they are asking is to look at just delegating approval for well construction because again the Commission is going to have that second bite at the apple regarding the pump installation and water use permit. I understand where that's coming from, at the same time I know that Jonathan has raised concerns about Hāpuna and that's just a monitor well. There's no pump being put into there but Jonathan did raise concerns at the first MOA presentation regarding breaching into a deep confined lens. I can see his point about wanting to have the ability to comment on even wells that aren't for production purposes. There's a lot of useful discussion here and a lot of, I don't want to say competing interest but a lot of different viewpoints that we need to take into perspective and understand. I'm certainly listening to the discussion and trying to see how best we can fold it into our recommendation at this time. I would say that to address the Board's concerns, maybe in item #3, we talk about well construction permits for exploratory purposes and amend the recommendation to say that.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Since Jonathan represents a department, another state agent, I'm going to let him come up but go-ahead Marc.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I just wanted to clarify, Commissioner Hannahs. I apologize, I misunderstood the question. As we looked back through it, item 1 and 2, overall it says get rid of the delegation except for a few cases. Our comment is because we would fall into the other ones.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"It's that last statement, all other permits and program approval is not explicitly delegated. That's where we…",1,B4,12/19/2023
"That's your concern, right?",1,B4,12/19/2023
That’s a big one.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"It’s in bold, even.",1,B4,12/19/2023
So that’s actually and I apologize.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"1-4 we don’t, but it’s that last.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"It’s the limitation of the delegation which used to be blanket. Now, it's constrained and I can see Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply and the bigger utilities who would be subject to that change are the ones who are raising concerns.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Three things in response to the conversation. In response to Commissioner Miike's questions, the actual practice has been that everything if it's not in a water management area, everything's been designated: small domestic wells, large municipal wells.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Delegated, thank you. It sometimes appears in the bulletin, occasionally they don't appear in the bulletin. There's been no public process, it's all happening at the staff level so the difference in what's proposed here versus the practice is that it's saying we're going to still delegate a whole bunch, a vast majority of permits which are small domestic wells but there are certain things we're not automatically delegating. That's the difference, that's what the proposal is. I think that the concerns from the Honolulu Board of Water Supply could possibly be addressed by an addition. The way the proposed action reads is everything is not delegated except for these four things and so five, municipal well construction permits in designated water management areas, that would be a fifth thing that is delegated to the chair for approval.",1,B4,12/19/2023
Is that acceptable to BWS?,1,B4,12/19/2023
"I can’t speak for the Board of Water Supply, but I follow the logic and I’ll take it back to our boss.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"The last thing and this gets to the point Ryan said. I will note that the recommendation does not specifically address wells that seek to explore or develop deep confined groundwater which I think do give rise to some fairly significant concerns and might deserve a specific call out that those are not delegated for approval. Right the problems that have been had at the Keōpū well and the Kaloko deep monitor well where they have breached the deep confined groundwater and in Keōpū. I think it took 17 years to seal it, Kaloko, it's still not sealed. Under the submittal, the staff is still delegated authority.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"If we add your point 5 which Board says it addresses their and leave the, all other permits and program approvals, then we're okay on that issue.",1,B4,12/19/2023
I actually read it slightly differently. I read that this would delegate authority for an exploratory well into the deep confined groundwater under item 3.,1,B4,12/19/2023
You would want that withdrawn?,1,B4,12/19/2023
"It would be something like, item 3 as worded comma after test holes except for Wells into deep confined groundwater comma and for the sealing of unused and abandoned wells.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I have language if you guys are open to suggested proposals, but before we get into…",1,B4,12/19/2023
Can we just go back to Bobby Command and Hawaiʻi Island.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"If I may, again to frame, chair has given me direction, I've been working with staff to get direction, we have permits coming in the door every day, every week. What we're trying to do is find a good balance between Chair's desire to be transparent and provide a space for this body to give us more guidance on policy as well as keep the engine running and operating. What I will advocate for is that this body act on the four items presented. Related to the Board and Departments of Water Supply maybe additional delegations that we have follow-up conversations with them about their specific situations and come back to this Commission with a more thought-out process and refined delegation. If that is something we want to recommend for consideration at a later time but I think what we as staff are advocating for is some kind of approval from this Commission or amended delegation so that Chair also feels comfortable signing because it is her decision to make. There's a lot of caveats here that she can always bring it back to the Commission as recommended in this space. My first recommendation is that this body take action on the four and we come back. We'll work on language. I’ll present some recommended language to address the testimony received today and then specific to the department and Board's unique, County municipal water system processes, we can work on maybe recommending a separate delegation that's more thought out.",1,B4,12/19/2023
Including the County of Hawaiʻi?,1,B4,12/19/2023
"May I ask a question to the staff and Chair? We vote on issues to delegate authority on many issues. Would it be too onerous to say we have a stack of permit applications and just go through so it's not guesswork, what is and what isn't delegated. Could that decision of what gets delegated come before the Commission in a shorter?",1,B4,12/19/2023
On specific permit by permit?,1,B4,12/19/2023
"Is that a submittal? I guess that's a lot of work, right?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"What we're asking for as this policymaking body are your heartburn issues. Areas that you want and believe community or the public should get to weigh in on where rights are impacted. You are the discretionary decision-making body, you get to guide us in what we can and cannot or what we should be bringing back to this body for decision making. I think what we're recommending is right here before you based on the dialogue to date and Chair's direction. We can come back in 60 to 90 days, maybe right after legislature because we're going to be busy come January through April. Right after legislature it'll give us time to work with the Counties on their unique situations on what permits and also with Chair, what she feels comfortable because it is a delegation to the chair at the end of the day. She could bring everything back to this body but what this group between the Department of Water Supply and the chair as well as staff feel comfortable recommending to this body. If it is no further action and this is the limit of the delegation then so be it, but we can have those conversations between now and let's say April or May for a time frame and then be specific to the recommended modifications, item 3, and Jonathan's testimony and so forth. If I can I'll just share screen of a potential modification to item 3 or if you want to take Commissioner Katayama first.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Ryan, based on the four recommendations before us, how does it affect the permit processing handling time? Does it make it shorter, longer or is it no change?",1,B4,12/19/2023
Based on the four recommendations we’re essentially keeping things the way that they are but are going to present non-individual domestic applications to the Commission. That's really hard to say. I would say that it does increase staff's workload fairly significantly to have to write submittals for those applications that don't comply with these conditions which would slow down the overall process for all applications.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"For the record going back to Dr. Miike’s question, can you summarize the differences between 1997 and the four recommendations you're making before us today? What are the differences?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I think the primary difference is that number 1 and 2 are really constraining the delegation to individual domestic wells so you may have some wells that are not individual domestic. Say for example as we've been discussing municipal wells and those would all come to the Commission until such time as we work out some kind of language and present it to the Commission to make some of those delegated. That's in essence the biggest difference. Again, maybe the bigger difference is going to come when we have an assessment of Ka Paʻakai and the applicability of Ka Paʻakai. That's where we're going to see differences in our ability to process things. One thing that I also haven't articulated in this entire thing is that most of the wells that are not within these delegations are actually still coming to you guys for approvals. I don't present a lot to you but where in water management areas unless there are these exploratory wells by the Board, I am bringing the applications to the Commission for approval and then there have been applications in other instances where we do bring it to you guys for approval. There's not a super significant change in the amount of work and the way that things are being processed but I think that this does two things. It specifically talks about individual domestic wells and really defining that as the delegation and then as a result it's just going to bring these water bottling wells or agricultural wells in non-management areas to you. I'm not going to say you're going to get ten a month but I think this delegation strikes a really good balance in allowing the Commission to have the ability to comment on things where there are issues related to reasonable and beneficial uses but not overburden the Commission with looking at every individual well in Hawaiian Paradise Park. That's why I cited those statistics because I don't think you guys want to see 15-gallon per minute pump permits where the sustainable yield is 350 MGD and they're not even pumping 1 MGD. This strikes a pretty good balance and I think that we do need to have discussion with the stakeholders as has been pointed out today about further enhancing which permits we want delegated and which permits we still wanted to take to the Commission. I hope that answers your question.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Wayne, I'm reading the 1997 delegation, the commission delegate the following Authority. The chair is authorized to approve well construction and well modification permit applications Statewide unless the chairperson determines the matter should be decided by the Commission. To me that's a blanket delegation and that's what I'm uncomfortable with. I agree with what Ryan is saying that these recommendations are designed to address the overwhelming domestic wells. We're not trying to slow those down and we're not trying to bog down staff on that but it really clarifies what has minimal impact. Unless a domestic well is right in the middle of a trail or the water is running into the ocean those really don't have any impact even on Ka Paʻakai. In my mind these recommendations are more tailored to our current situation and reflects the case load so I feel more comfortable with this than what we were relying on the 1997.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Frankly, Ryan I think you've done a good job on this everybody's had a lot of very constructive comments. There has been lots of good discussion on this issue. I feel personally this is reasonably and a relatively efficient approach or system for reviewing and processing these permits and I think there are adequate protections in place to prevent any wrongful or inappropriate approvals. One approach which I'd like to see this approved…",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I just want to get a better comfort level on that this is not impacting adversely the municipal water development efforts because they impact the larger community. If I understand that you know the larger wells or municipal wells have a greater impact on our water resources; however, do we want to impede or make their processes longer and more expensive and I think after hearing today's testimony I would feel much better if we could strike a better balance and comprehend some of their concerns.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I think this is a reasonable approach and it’s relatively efficient and it's a pretty good system for reviewing and processing these permits. There are adequate protections in place. If I could suggest that we approve this today and ask Ryan to come back to us in a year to report on what problems have become evident and at that time folks can provide additional testimony for mistakes or inappropriate things happening and at that point the approval process could be modified. In other words, move ahead at this point with the well- considered system that has largely been in place with some additional protections going forward and then review it in a year, I think is a reasonable approach.",1,B4,12/19/2023
I feel like we're ready to look at the language now if you're going to insert any additional language in the recommendation.,1,B4,12/19/2023
Can I ask for some better articulation around that bifurcation of process with designated and non-designated areas. It's in text but it's not clear to me and maybe it's also not clear to others how that process differs and at what point Ka Paʻakai becomes part of the conversation. For designated areas it's in the water use permit process so it's already addressed. Where it isn't addressed is in undesignated areas. Not to lengthen things but to frontend potential conflict it might be good for the Commission to clarify and work out for ourselves when and where that happens. That's my sense right now.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"I'm just trying to understand the question. I think you're talking about the bifurcation or the difference between designated and non-designated areas in where Ka Paʻakai applies, right? On the issue of Ka Paʻakai, I don't think we've made any kind of conclusive decision about Ka Paʻakai analyses as they apply to individual well construction and pump installation permits. Right or wrong this is my assessment is it is important to understand that back in ‘97 when we adopted the standards they were really designed to show de minimis impact. I'm not going to say what my opinions are but they were really designed to make sure that there are protections in place. I think Ka Paʻakai issues are minimalized or impacts to the environment are minimalized when someone complies with the well standards.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Let me back up, what I meant is there is a different workflow if you are in a designated or non-designated area and maybe the applicants know that but I'm looking at the permit application and it doesn't necessarily show that workflow. What you articulated verbally today I did not capture on the submittal.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Yeah because that's not what we're asking for. Yes, I hear what you're saying, to contextualize within the larger code and that process, we didn't talk about designation process, we didn't talk about water use permits. This is purely with relation to the delegation to the chairperson for well construction, pump installation permits and all of the other well certificates and other approvals that have been delegated in a management area. The only additional thing required is a water use permit, that has its own body, breath, process, all of that analysis outside of a management area. If you want to dig a well you get a well construction and pump installation permit. Right now that's completely delegated to the chair to approve and via practice the deputy has been approving that with staff. This basically dusts off that delegation and says, renewed in 2023 this is the limit of the delegation: individual domestic wells which make up over half of our permit applications, everything else is coming back to this Commission and this body. To make it very simple, individual domestic wells are delegated to the chair to sign, chair will sign that, everything else comes back to this body.",1,B4,12/19/2023
But that's really only 1 and 2 referenced.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"1 and 2, #3 is a regurgitation of the existing delegation with the first delegation back in, monitoring wells, abandonments, basically things to protect the aquafer is delegated to the chairperson to review and we want to continue that but with recommended language and modifications. If I can share my screen specific to that?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Before you do that can I add one thing? Aurora, I don’t think you’ll see a lot of differences in the process with respect to designated and non-designated areas. One of the biggest differences you're going to see is in the way that the Departments of Water Supply apply for permits versus the way that private users apply for permits because Board of Water Supply can invest the capital in drilling an exploratory well and then not develop it. I'm sure they want some assurances that they'd be able to develop that and get a water use permit but private land owners always apply, especially out in Wailua, Mokuleʻia where we are bringing the applications to you, Kahuku, we're bringing the applications to you guys for approval. You'll see the well pump and water use permits all come to you at the same time. The difference is not so much in management areas, non-management areas, it's in the big municipalities versus the private systems. That's where you're going to see the biggest difference in the process.",1,B4,12/19/2023
I agree that based on the applications that come before this.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"Ryan, with respect to workload as I understand it why this became such an issue with staff is the submittals that you guys prepare you would have to do one of those for every single one of these Hawaiian Paradise applications, right? This delegation says those are continued to be delegated because those have de minimis impact. They are for domestic use and the water that they're using is so minuscule in comparison to some of the other well construction permits that we're doing. That's really what this is addressing because otherwise in the absence of that delegation you will have to prepare a staff submittal for every single one of those and that could delay that domestic user from installing and may even increase their costs.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Cindy, we've discussed this in the past or we've discussed this with the AG's office in the past is the applicability of Chapter 343 I thought was applicable towards discretionary permits and not ministerial permits. That's a whole other ball of wax if things become discretionary then there may be applicability of 343 and 343 might need to be done for all well permits, too.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I think there's still exemptions, but Kaleo did you want to show us?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"To get us closer towards some action within the early afternoon hours if possible. The only thing I'm recommending to amend, everything remains the same except for 3. We're just going to be a little bit more specific. This is getting to the Board's testimony to be very explicit so it's well construction permits for monitoring, sampling, and observation wells and test holes not including any injection wells under the authority of the Department of Health, soil borings for geological investigation for structural foundation design, and monitoring wells into deep confined aquifer…something like that is addressing all of the testimony specific to the delegation. Those would come back to the Commission or are not applicable is what the Board is wanting clarification on.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Deep injection wells that BWS talked about where this clarified, that's a DOH, that doesn’t come to us. Then Jonathan's concerns, deep confined aquifer does that address your concern?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I would not include the word ‘monitoring,’ I would just say ‘and wells’ into the deep confined aquifer which again wouldn't mean that people can't go into it but it comes before this board.",1,B4,12/19/2023
The default is everything comes before this board unless the chairperson chooses delegation.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"Wording thing, do you want to clarify that these things don't even fall, two of them don't fall within the purview?",1,B4,12/19/2023
I was trying to figure it out but I think within the record of this conversation it would be sufficient unless you want to clarify that it’s not applicable?,1,B4,12/19/2023
"No, I trust you folks.",1,B4,12/19/2023
Marc did you want to add anything to that?,1,B4,12/19/2023
"If I heard correctly, first appreciate Deputy Manuel for his offer to continue to discuss this in condition of a #5. If you approve it as is right now then the Board of Water, other municipal wells would still fall under the, have to come to the Commission for well construction permits. We're still actually in the same spot, with that regard our testimony still stands. We don't agree with that part. There's an undefined amount of time as much as we will try to work together that we will be caught in that situation.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I don't know how to address that because on one hand the balance is I don't think our intention is to create a longer delay or more work, member Katayama's concerns about not wanting to cause delays for municipal providers. Kaleo, can you think of anything to address that?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"If there's a time commitment we could move to approve as amended with an additional requirement to come back to this body in 60 days or 90 days. I'm just trying to manage expectations once the legislature starts it's an all hands on deck issue and then consulting beyond just the Board and Hawaii County then we'd want to work through that. I also don't know if there's any specific permits, I'd have to check with Ryan what we've already received or if there's going to be submissions coming from the Board for any specific wells.",1,B4,12/19/2023
I’ll go by the first statement that I’m not manager in chief of the Board of Water Supply [inaudible].,1,B4,12/19/2023
"Well now that it's absolutely clear, can I recommend they accept the staff recommendation with amendments?",1,B4,12/19/2023
Second. You're going to go back and work with them on their issues?,1,B4,12/19/2023
"Yeah and we can work through it. I don't think it's addressing their concern and this is where I need to check on what's in the pipe or what permits do we have like what construction permits do we have to act on or process that would fall in this category? I don't know if that's one or two or 20. If we can get clarity on that and what we could do is also just expedite it and bring it to this Commission to approve within that time frame. We don't even have to wait, we could just bring it to Commission as a submittal and again it's Chair, everything is delegated to you right now. It's really what the Chair feels comfortable signing or bringing to this Commission. This is the guidance that has been given.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Your interest is time, not process? If the process is it comes to us you just want to make sure it happens in a timely way.",1,B4,12/19/2023
You don't have any objections to 1 and 2?,1,B4,12/19/2023
Or 3 and 4.,1,B4,12/19/2023
Because 1 and 2 only applies to individual domestic pumps.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"In that case it's the overall delegation removed, that's where we’re impacted, that’s where our comments are coming from. 1 and 2 is just allowing Chair to go ahead and have [inaudible] so it's not quite the same question [inaudible].",1,B4,12/19/2023
"1-4 is okay, it’s when we say all other we capture them and we put them into something that needs to come to us.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Even if you take that out they still are captured. The reason we put that there was just to make it very clear that this is the limit of what the Commission is approving. We try to think through all of the things that currently come before me or Chair to sign, but if for whatever reason we didn't catch something in this submittal which I'm pretty sure we got everything, that is just a catch-all. This body is the final decision maker, not staff which is what we heard is a concern. That's the point of that bold statement at the end whether that statement's there or not… If it's not there then one could assume that the 1997 delegation stays intact and it adds these additional delegations which would make this decision pointless.",1,B4,12/19/2023
But your commitment is to work with them.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"And Ryan as well, not just me but we're trying to work through these processes also with Chair. As Chair mentioned the impetus and refocus of this is to dust off delegations to make it clear and have her as the leader of our agency feel comfortable with guidance from this body.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I’d just like the sunshine to come in but I also don't want to be the basis upon which we're holding up the process either so there's got to be some nice compromise here. People have an opportunity to comment, at the same time we're facilitating the process. Bobby Command, you're still on board Hawaiʻi County and their Department of Water Supply, have we addressed their concerns?",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I am not an employee of the Department of Water Supply so I can't make any statements for them, the only thing I would say is that this is a very spirited and interesting discussion. I don't claim to be a water expert by any means but Water Supply is not here and I think they deserve to have a little bit of say in that or at least get their comments in. I know they provided testimony but it wouldn't hurt to defer and speak to them first.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I'll say having read their testimony they didn't speak against any of these issues, any of the four things we’re approving. They just had other issues.",1,B4,12/19/2023
I think they were concerned with Ka Paʻakai.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"Again, we agreed we need to resolve.",1,B4,12/19/2023
That is still being addressed by staff and the AG's office.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"The Ka Paʻakai in this context we're not addressing that. That issue at this point in time we need more time with counsel to determine whether it's on every single application, when it comes in, when is it applicable. We're just talking about the delegation to Chair to approve permits and that process is now being modified to be more explicit, That's the extent of it.",1,B4,12/19/2023
Which helps a lot of Hawaiʻi Island constituents.,1,B4,12/19/2023
"The Puna side, definitely. Hearing the conversation a lot of the concerns are tied to our municipal water systems and hearing the testimony from Department and Board similar to what Ryan was saying, there are a lot of private developers that develop wells and then dedicate them on Big Island, for example or Maui to the Boards or Departments of Water. That could come before this body for decision making.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Maybe having an opportunity Kaleo, you and your staff convening a meeting with all of the Board of Water Supplies to address this. I think that would be helpful before we come back, before you guys come back. Between now and throughout leg. we can work through that process and if there are any specific permits that are ready for approval, we can bring those. Chair, if you don't want to sign we can bring this to the body in February, March, April, whenever.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"Bobby, did you hear that? You tell Keith Okamoto if he's got any permits that he wants to have heard before us, bring it to us.",1,B4,12/19/2023
"I will do that, thank you.",1,B4,12/19/2023
We are open to having those processed in a timely fashion.,1,B4,12/19/2023

Well construction permits for monitor, sampling, and observation wells and test holes, not including any injection wells under the authority of the Department of Health, soil borings for geologic investigation for structural foundation design and wells into the deep confined aquifer, and for the sealing of unused and abandoned wells, provided that they comply with the Hawaii Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards and have no other regulatory issues.

"Ayron, in some cases we are making adaptations to existing infrastructure in order to achieve our purpose that are kind of old. Do we take into account the life of the infrastructure that’s going to be there and if it degrades or breaks down and compromises the instream flow standards, do we have the authority to go back and say, okay, more work needs to be done?",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Definitely, I believe that the operator of any stream diversion can upgrade or repair a diversion without a permit, as needed, as long as the original design doesn’t change and they’re not increasing the capacity in that sense.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"That’s their option. Do we have the authority to, if it breaks, to go back and say, no, this has to be done?",1,B1,04/16/2024

"So the idea is to leave them in place, have these changes happen, and then track it for some amount of time to make sure we’re effective, okay. Is that data available? We got to find it on that website I keep forgetting. It might be helpful to make sure just for transparency sake, we let people know like, hey, look this is available for you if you don’t believe us or if you want to see the effects for yourself.

As a condition for monitoring. I mean how are we supposed to monitor without having...,1,B1,04/16/2024
"Dean Uyeno, acting Deputy. These gages are pressure transducers so they’re recording data every 15 minutes. It requires staff to go out every three months. I think that’s something that we’ve certainly considered in the past and how to do that, whether it’s purchasing the equipment, we have had other operators purchase equipment and Ayron has assisted with installing them.",1,B1,04/16/2024

"Can I comment? As I do monitoring work, people trust their own data.

We should consider having the applicant, where they can, to provide for those tools.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"To Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani’s point, especially in these cases where it’s a gage that’s being used for enforcement of the instream flow standard, that’s where I think we should be doing the data collection over the diverter.

"And EMI has been really, I mean they’ve been willing to do a lot to meet the IIFS. They have been making appropriate changes, but it would be in, I would suspect, their best interest, too, to elevate the level of compliance.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Streamflow monitoring is a very complicated and technical thing to do and it’s not necessarily just the cost of the equipment. It is our time and we take it very seriously and we dedicate about five days every two to three months to be in East Maui, if not more regularly. And that’s just for routine monitoring, not the other site visits we do and the installations that we work on. It’s a big part of the Stream Protection and Management Branch, so we definitely see the benefit. We are still fiscally limited and we don’t have the staff or time to be everywhere all at once, there’s a lot of perennial streams out there, so we have to balance across our time.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"I also think for informed decision making are there trends, are we seeing differences in the quality of water, the flow of water? Having all of these stream gages are really critical in addition to enforcement, but also just for good, informed decision making as we consider things like climate change. I would, Dean, like us to start looking at what we’re doing, what we’re considering for permit application fees or water permit fees. The cost to manage this program far exceeds what are we charging, $25, $50. I mean that’s just absurd, so from an administrative standpoint I think the staff need the tools and resources to effectively do your work. Hopefully at some point in time we don’t have to have Ayron literally running into all of these streams, but we may have tools that can make his job more efficient. That’s just a comment, but I do want us to really look at that. What can we do to ensure that there are appropriate tools and how do we pass that on to the people who are benefiting from the sources?",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Could you dimensionalize that? If you took all the streams and water courses of surface water, how many monitoring situations do you think there are out there, right now?",1,B1,04/16/2024
How many locations do we monitor?,1,B1,04/16/2024
"Yes, how many if we were going to put a comprehensive program into all water courses for surface water in the state?",1,B1,04/16/2024
"We currently fund about 50 USGS gaging stations. We’ve convinced other agencies to fund another 12 or 15 and that’s through USGS. Within the Water Commission, we operate about 55 streamflow monitoring stations that are continuous and another dozen or so that are just point...",1,B1,04/16/2024
A comprehensive program for all water courses?,1,B1,04/16/2024
"Every single one? Wailua for example, is a very complicated watershed that has at least five major tributaries and we monitor three of them and we help monitor four of the ditches in there, but that doesn’t mean that’s a comprehensive monitoring plan. It’s just the most practical that we can implement. There are some streams that maybe we don’t need to monitor, especially I know we’ve talked about monitoring the Hanakāpiʻai or Kalalau Streams on the Nāpali. But really, yes, other than monitoring for climate change impacts to our natural environment, it doesn’t serve a management role which we’re trying to focus on. What is necessary to implement a sound management plan.",1,B1,04/16/2024
In a sampling approach. Thank you.,1,B1,04/16/2024
"There are probably 120 gages necessary, if not 150 statewide as a minimum, and we’re at maybe 100.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"That’s doable, that seems to be an attainable goal. If we can ensure that the costs are appropriately...to those that are...I don’t know how we do enforcement without that tool. I think that it would be in their best interest. There’s perception that they’re not complying. In the absence of having tools, how do we confirm that? Again, I think that there’s some benefit to the applicant as well. Long-term, not so long-term resolution, hopefully we can think about that sooner rather than later.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Our previous deputy had requested adding about five USGS gages a year to the annual cooperative agreement, which is about $250,000 to $300,000 needed, in addition to the operating and maintenance costs. That’s where we were hoping to do the request from the leg(islature).",1,B1,04/16/2024
"I know that Katie is going to give a report on some of the Congressional funding that we’ve got, but I think if it’s a shared cost with the applicant, that’s something that we should consider.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Just a quick comment, there was a 2020 study done by the USGS that outlined monitoring needs statewide and that accounted for upwards of $170 million worth of needs. That’s something that we do reference when thinking about costs and what we could take on as an agency.",1,B1,04/16/2024
That might be a little bit too big.,1,B1,04/16/2024
"Yeah, it’s a huge amount of money needed but just to put it into context.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Sort of taking it in phases or prioritizing where are the more key places, especially if we have to enforce. So think about that.",1,B1,04/16/2024
I just appreciate all the work that CWRM staff has done in preparation for this and just ask the Commissioners to take this into consideration.,1,B1,04/16/2024
"Thank you, Mark. Have you heard just the previous conversation about having the applicant install or pay for some monitoring gages?",1,B1,04/16/2024
I have. We currently pay for some USGS gauges but are willing to have that conversation.,1,B1,04/16/2024
"Very good, thank you so much. I appreciate that.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this permit and thank you for getting these permits moving along thanks to EMI and the staff for the tremendous amount of work put into all the reports and all the field work that Ayron has done. I have a couple of comments, I’m testifying on behalf of the Sierra Club here, Maui group. First of all, do support having some allocation for Hawaiian Home Lands and for their non-potable use. I’m assuming that would be through Haʻikū Ditch which goes to Pūlehunui, their future development. Hope that that can work out because that is a water source for them. Secondly, I’d like to speak to the proposed modifications for the Hanawana, this is the Diversion 177 or commonly known as Lowrie or L13 to prevent clogging. This is action 2.8.1 for those of you who follow that. My understanding is from having visited that intake a number of times over the years is that there’s two problems. One is that the pipe clogs up and the other is that the pipe clogs up because the area that is available to accumulate water to go into the pipe is actually not very large and of course, it’s subject to debris. I don’t know if just putting in the larger pipe, modifying the pipe, will really solve the problem there. At the time when we did the site visit, it was discussed having some sort of a bypass. The whole stream at that point, Hanawana Stream runs into the Lowrie Ditch and the pipe is just above that intersection with the ditch and the pipe. The pipe is kind of a stop gap measure, but a channel that would go over the ditch would be a better long-term implementation. I wonder if anyone from the community was out there to discuss the size of the pipe that was needed. There’s a number of people that do depend upon that pipe. This is a popular neighborhood, Hanawana, it’s not someplace where nobody lives, I’d say several hundred people live there on little farms. Once again that this is why having the community involved and understanding what is proposed with an on-site visit is just so important. I understand we don’t want to hold up these permits in any way, but if there is time when we talked about this other on-site visit for the previous permit, it would be good to include Hanawana in that site visit along with other streams mentioned like Hoʻolawa and Waipiʻo, etc. Moving on about the discussion of passing the costs of the monitoring and gages onto the applicant, it is common that conditions of zoning at the county level do pass costs of like monitoring for water quality onto the applicant. However, there is that caveat that the applicant chooses their own consultant. I agree with the comments that the best and most reliable information does come from the CWRM staff and so if there was a way that a fund could be established to help support that and expand that and it was legally permissible, I think our community would be in support of that. Also, I just want to say that in general, there has been a lot of thought put into the recreational uses. The Hoʻolawa Stream, especially, has a lot of recreational use and is well managed and it has a lot of diversions. A few are being modified, but once again that is a place where really the community, this is in their backyard, literally. Twin Falls community, the community should be standing there understanding what is proposed to happen where on at least one public visit. If that can be arranged, doesn’t have to hold up any of the implementation, but if that could be arranged, it would really be keeping with the intent of the 2018 revisions to the streamflow where the idea was to really do this in a manner that was easily understood to the public. That was one of the goals that was set there and I think a lot of efforts were made. I have to say, we used to have regular visits in our neighborhood with CWRM staff and EMI staff and talk about how things were being modified. It didn’t seem to be prohibitive to do. It was fewer diversions, but it happened and it was very productive. Thank you for your time and understanding and for moving these permits forward so that we can start seeing our stream flows protected and monitored on a long- term basis.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Aloha, I work with Lucienne with the Sierra Club. I want to mention three things quickly. First, I want to thank both Ayron and Mark Vaught for this submittal which represents some progress on the ground and we’re hopeful. Secondly, I want to address Chair Chang’s concern about paying for monitoring. Your Deputy AG may be concerned about your legal authority in this context to assess a fee, but clearly the Board of Land and Natural Resource has the legal authority under 171-55 to require that A&B (Alexander & Baldwin) pay for monitoring of these streams. That’s clearly within the Board’s jurisdiction, no question. You folks probably can do it as well, but there’s certainly no question the Board can do it. Finally, the Board has now been assessing a fee to require A&B to pay for some watershed management which is progress. The charge the Board is assessing is not as much as we think it should be, but it’s better than it was before when it was nothing. The Board could and should also be charging A&B a fee to monitor the streams. We’ve been asking that for years and Chair Case wouldn’t let us get to first base on that, but hopefully that can be a discussion the Board of Land Natural Resources has. The third thing I want to mention is it would be helpful if you folks imposed some sort of deadline. This is, I believe, the third set of applications for modifications of structures on the Huelo streams. You approved the first one, I think it was last May. My understanding is no work has occurred on those diversion structures. My information may be outdated, but I would like you folks to ask A&B, EMI what the status is of the alteration diversion structures and what’s a deadline for these. We recognize, as Commissioner Hannahs pointed out earlier, there may be in the Red Hill context, that there may be reasons why deadlines can’t be met. Maybe there’s a permitting issue, maybe there are weather conditions, whatever. I think it’s important that you folks set a deadline and also get a status of what you guys have already required because we have no idea what the status is of all the modifications you’ve already made and when these ones will be made. Thank you very much.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Just the standard Stream Diversion Works permit has a two-year window and obviously there are other potential permits necessary whether it’s an SMA, whether it’s CDUP, whether it’s Army Corps that have to be obtained for certain permitting requirements. I believe that the Stream Diversion Works permit can also be extended, but at the moment there’s a two-year window.",1,B1,04/16/2024
Thank you for that clarification.,1,B1,04/16/2024
"I just appreciate, Ayron, this detailed rundown and the testimony. And the comment also about progress, maybe this is for Mark. Given like the number of modifications that are happening, do you folks have a capacity or staff who could maybe just develop a web dashboard to show where these different projects are at and maybe what the holdups are on some? Okay, we’re waiting for this permit or that permit, just so you’re not answering the same questions all the time. There’s probably real reasons that things may be held up.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Mahalo for your question. I would have to check into the web dashboard thing, to be perfectly honest, I’m not that smart so I don’t know too much about technology and what that entails, but I’m willing to ask the questions. I do know, I’d have to check with our our consultants as far as the permitting because I know that’s where things were getting a little bit sticky, going all the way through the permits and SHPD (State Historical Preservation Division) and everything else. But I don’t know, I could find out and try to update the status on the permits.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"And I just want to share, I’m learning with my students. There’s some amazingly easy web mapping tools that are now available. I’m just thinking, I teach a class and I might have students mock something up to get the ideas going about what a potential communication...I understand you guys don’t have as much money as the US Navy for these kinds of things, but I think it would be helpful... these ideas of dashboards I got from you (pointing to Commissioner Hannahs). I’ve seen what helps.",1,B1,04/16/2024
I’m pretty sure the Navy has a lot of money.,1,B1,04/16/2024
I’m thinking about like Maui College students and these data science projects. I’d be happy to maybe suggest some ideas. That was more of a comment and an idea.,1,B1,04/16/2024
"Appreciate it, thank you.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Can I ask, Ayron, how many streams are we actually monitoring that are related to this in East Maui, specifically on this agenda item.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Oh on this agenda item, including what we pay USGS to monitor? CHAIR CHANG: Yes.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"In some locations, there are multiple monitoring stations. I know Honopou is no longer diverted, but it was originally. We have a long-term monitoring station that we pay USGS to maintain on Honopou. We’re monitoring at Hoʻolawaliʻiliʻi, we’re monitoring Hoalua, natural flow. We’re paying USGS to monitor Nāʻiliʻilihāʻele, natural flow. We’re monitoring the IIFS at one location on Nāʻiliʻilihāʻele. We’re doing point measurements on Ohanui and Kailua, we’re monitoring ʻOʻopuola continuously, the IIFS. We’re monitoring Kaʻaiea continuously, the IIFS.",1,B1,04/16/2024
Maybe I should ask you the other way around.,1,B1,04/16/2024
"I’m sorry I don’t have a number, I have to go through in my head where they’re located.",1,B1,04/16/2024
I probably interfered with your walking through.,1,B1,04/16/2024
I would say roughly 14 places in the Huelo license area.,1,B1,04/16/2024
How many are not being monitored?,1,B1,04/16/2024
It depends if you want to monitor natural flow conditions above the system or regulated flow conditions of the IIFS.,1,B1,04/16/2024
"No, that’s a question I’ll ask you. If the locations are dependent upon areas...",1,B1,04/16/2024
"For example, Hoʻolawanui, we’ve done a partial record gaging for two years and the low flow conditions in that station are very tightly related to the index station or the Honopou Stream flow. We can say with confidence whatever is flowing in Honopou, we can calculate what is flowing in Hoʻolawanui. In Hoʻolua, the relationship is less confident, so that’s why we added a natural flow monitoring station to monitor natural flow conditions that exist in Hoʻolua over time. Again, with changing climate patterns, changing forest cover, we want to know how much water is available to meet all of the off stream needs. Nāʻiliʻilihāʻele is a big watershed. We added a USGS gauge to that stream or really reestablished a discontinued USGS gauge in 2021. That station monitors above the Wailoa Ditch. We monitor below the new Hāmākua Ditch.",1,B1,04/16/2024
If I was to make a recommendation?,1,B1,04/16/2024
"But there are three other locations I could potentially monitor, just it’s not really accessible. Once these structural modifications get met, we know for a fact that the low-flow is going to stay in the stream. So do we need to absolutely monitor every location? No, that’s why the recommendations were kind of put or designed to keep the low flows in the streams structurally instead of manually. There are some places in the state where the IIFS is met because somebody’s opening a valve, and we don’t want to have to run around and make sure all those valves stay open.",1,B1,04/16/2024
If I made a condition that or recommended a condition that the applicant and CWRM coordinate a monitoring program?,1,B1,04/16/2024
"I mean we work well with USGS, I mean EMI.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Yeah, that’s the impression I’m getting. Is that something so that you could prioritize? Again, my concern is compliance and our ability to enforce and our ability to also raise the level of confidence that what is going on is actually happening. Is that something if I recommended a condition that CWRM and the applicant work together to fill in the gaps of where we don’t have adequate monitoring?",1,B1,04/16/2024
"To me, it would depend on what defines adequate monitoring because we monitor pretty much every stream in some capacity. The question is once the modifications get implemented, do we see the response in the hydrology that we expect and that’s where we’re monitoring streams that we have low certainty. We’re implementing a very well-coordinated monitoring plan.",1,B1,04/16/2024
Do you need any more monitoring? 24,1,B1,04/16/2024
We need more money and more staff.,1,B1,04/16/2024
"Okay, but for this agenda I cannot go beyond the agenda item.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"I think on Huelo we already spend a substantial amount of our resources monitoring. We were working with DAR to monitor the streams, stream health in terms of biota. There are only 365 days a year, but we have implemented what we can.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"This may not happen again, so it is an opportunity. I don’t want to make a condition if there’s no need for it.",1,B1,04/16/2024
We have allocated our resources appropriately to effectively monitor the Huelo region.,1,B1,04/16/2024
"Okay, with that being said then I won’t make any. As you look at future submittals, if that is something you want the Board to consider, I would recommend that staff include that as a condition based upon what’s the rationale, how much do you need, what are you recommending. But based upon what I’m hearing today, it may not be necessary because you’ve got a good working relationship with Mark and his team and you do seem to have adequate resources.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Really what’s limiting us as a State would be staff on Maui, whether it’s in DAR or CWRM. People that can do things more regularly than we can when it comes to very time intensive investigations like biota surveys.",1,B1,04/16/2024
"Okay, that may be above my pay grade right now, it’s probably not above my pay grade. It’s probably at my pay grade, I think the buck stops here. But that’s a larger question, so I’m going to go back to the agenda item.",1,B1,04/16/2024

Staff stated the summary of request which is to approve SDWP.6001.2 in accordance with the Waimea Watershed Agreement.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"Good morning again, Chair, members of the Commission. Maybe what I’ll do is we did submit testimony as well but maybe I’ll try to preemptively answer some of the questions and maybe related to some of the discussion in the last item. We definitely take to heart the point about we engaged in the mediation process, and we signed off on a plan. One of the challenges we ran into early on in that process was sort of this fork in the road question on, well what happens in phase one if phase one is all that happens permanently and what happens if you have phase one and then it’s transitioning quickly into phase two. From our perspective it was apparent that you would at least need an entirely different set of considerations in a phase one standalone scenario versus a phase one as a transitional to phase two. Then it became a question to us, and did we feel it was reasonable to demand that two separate phase one plans were fully engineered and permitted. The reason you would have had to do that in parallel was because of the lengthy time period that we did actually see realized in getting Army Corps and all the other necessary approvals. You had to pick what you thought was the most likely scenario and run that down to ground and it wasn’t feasible to say, well we have to keep in mind that if the less likely scenario ends up being realized we need to continue to do all of the work required to potentially implement that alternate universe instead of the one in which we all thought at the time the energy project would move forward. That’s not to say that maybe we made a mistake in taking that approach. I’m not saying that we necessarily made the right decision at the time but that was our thought process. We didn’t foresee that as a possibility, it’s that at a ground level what would it take to actually say, well if we really didn’t do phase two then what would you do that would be an entirely different and significant set of work engineering, permitting, etc. that in all likelihood if we went to Army Corps with two different plans they would say figure out which one you’re going to do and then come back and we’ll permit that one. There was a logistical hurdle to that idealized concept of, well we’ve got a standalone thing if we don’t do phase two and we’ve got a plan if we do phase two. We had to run with the more likely option at the time, at least that was our perspective.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Commissioners, any questions for Joshua?",1,B2,01/30/2024
I want to ask a more implementation question. If we approve a stream diversion permit it has to start work within what a year?,1,B2,01/30/2024
"No, the permit’s good for two years.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Okay, so if we approve a permit and they don’t do anything then it expires?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"If we don’t approve a permit, they can’t do anything?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"And that’s what got us here is they had a permit, but they didn’t do anything.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Correct. The only issue may be that if there were concerns about the actions that they’re applying for, if there are issues with how they’re doing the construction at certain diversions.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"My point is that if you don’t give them a permit, there’s no incentive for people to come to some conclusion. If you give them a permit then they got to do something and I’m not talking about the applicant, I’m talking about people, the applicant and people who are concerned about their permit. I don’t want to get stuck in foreverland forever. I’d like to force the issue.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Elena Bryant on behalf of Earthjustice. As I stated in my earlier testimony on B1 the mediation agreement required basic structural modifications to be done to ensure that stream flow would be restored to the maximum extent possible and to ensure connectivity and a wetted path for which stream life could traverse. For Waiakōali the dam there diverts all stream flow, completely dewatering the stream below unless a heavy rainfall event allows some of the flows to over top the dam. At the hydrologist meeting that was alluded to by previous testifiers on B1 there’s no modifications proposed for Waiakōali to ensure stream flow restoration, let alone connectivity. For Kawaikōī and Kauaikinana, planning boards remain in the ditch that prevent stream flow restoration to the maximum extent possible and the proposal set forth by KAA do have incremental improvements by moving boards up but not out. Again, this still doesn’t comply with the spread of the agreement. None of KAA’s concerns or DHHL’s concerns were ever brought to our attention, ADC claimed they were aware of these on November 7th. They weren’t shared at the January compliance meeting two weeks ago with Earthjustice or our clients. DHHL states they were made aware of this on Friday. Same thing, nothing was ever brought to our attention, so we do stand by the terms of the mediation agreement and the commitments that each party to the agreement made and ask this Commission to approve staff recommendation. If the Commission is inclined to defer, we would ask that this be placed on the agenda for the next meeting to ensure that the parties are in fact communicating and engaging in good faith discussions to meet the commitments in the agreement that were agreed upon seven years ago. Thank you and I’m available for any questions.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Good morning, Chair, good morning, members. Essentially, the same summary as before. We stand on our written testimony on this. Our main concern is making sure that DHHL and our users are able to receive the appropriate amount of water. If the analysis proves accurate, which it looks like it will, we’re just concerned about making sure that the users have the appropriate amounts of water.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Lyle, if I can ask you when you say the analysis, you’re relying upon Basil Gomez’s analysis?",1,B2,01/30/2024
Did you just hear his testimony that the same data was presented in 2015?,1,B2,01/30/2024
"Yeah, I wasn’t here at the time, and I wasn’t aware of that, so for our purposes and admittedly we’ve had some turnover in this office, I became aware of this on the 7th.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Hi Lyle, this is Wayne Katayama. Are there any reservations for not renewing KIUC’s license or right of access to the site?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"There is on our part at least until we know we have a holistic view of what this project is going to look like both in terms and I guess when I say that I’m referring to the old scope, the West Kauaʻi Energy Project, the hydro portion has been eliminated. For our parts we want to know what the new project is going to look like before we make any approvals. I think we just want to make sure we don’t piecemeal things and perhaps have an idea of what’s happening over here, but we don’t have a firm idea of what’s happening over here. We’d like a holistic view of what the project changes are and what the amended scope will look like.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I’d just like to make a comment about I’ve heard several times about we want to assure that our people get the water. There are no absolutes in these streams, we’re talking about stream restoration and off-stream uses. One does not trump the other completely so if there has to be a balance, part of that balance is that everybody doesn’t get everything they want. That’s my only comment on this.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Good morning again, Commissioners. For the record Dr. Jonathan Likeke Scheuer for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. I appreciated the comments and questions on the all the testimony given and the comments and questions from the Commissioners during B1. I want to add first a little bit of additional information that I alluded to. We have long-term plans for a small portion of our 15,000 acres of land, particularly the lands around Puʻuʻōpae, about 300 acres of lands have been issued by license to a homestead association and they are currently farming on those lands. In addition, for decades we have had five homestead lots at the very mauka portion of our lands and three of those lots are occupied by a homesteader who ranches on those lands. They receive water now from the ditch system coming from Puʻuloa Reservoir through the Puʻumoe divide. It’s fairly inefficient because it’s an unlined old irrigation ditch and one of our motivations for participating in the agreement was the promise that we would be able to get this water piped to our providing us and the Water Commission a much better way to balance instream and off-stream uses, you minimizing stream losses. We were surprised at the assertions shared with us on Friday and then Monday that this implementation of B2 could result in a lack of delivery of water to our lands. We haven’t had a chance as I said to independently verify it. I absolutely share with everybody including Earthjustice’s attorney and the Commissioners a frustration at we’ve been working for something for so long and hey at the last second, we’re asking for you to hold the breaks on it. I want to point out that DHHL has actually continued to do its part in the implementation of the Waimea Mediation Agreement in good faith, including spending hundreds of thousands of dollars going through an environmental assessment process for what homesteading would look like around Puʻuʻōpae. We also issued that went through the entire beneficiary consultation process, issued a long-term lease to KIUC for access to our lands for their portion of the project. We’ve continued to participate all along. The concern that I have at this moment on behalf of DHHL is I don’t know whether or not this implementation of these diversion changes which are required under the agreement would result in the failure to be able to deliver water six months of the year to our tenants. If that’s the case, we obviously have a very significant concern. That’s on the fly where we’re at with this submittal. Happy to answer any questions.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Jonathan, did you hear the prior testimony of Mr. Gomez that that data was old data from 2015 and that the parties knew that in 2017 when they executed the mediation settlement agreement. So why would it be a surprise that there’d be periods of time when less water was in the system and available to its users.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Thank you, Commissioner Hannahs, I did hear the testimony of Mr. Gomez. I was not the lead for DHHL during the mediation agreement so I can only represent what I had as a consultant supporting the leads for the Department. I apologize if I get some of this slightly incorrect, but this is my understanding. As the agreement was planning to move forward, operational control of the system was going to transition from KAA, ADC to KIUC. We repeatedly spoke with KIUC as the West Kauaʻi Energy Project was moving forward about how we would continue to be able to assure delivery of water to our homesteaders and homestead tenants during all phases of the project. When KIUC was involved with the entirety of the project through phase one to phase two, we had those assurances. They were very clear, yes and it was actually in our lease agreement with KIUC. Now, as it appears it might go KIUC’s obligation under the Waimea Mediation Agreement ends with their implementation of these phase one diversions and so the operator would now not become KIUC but would instead remain KAA and ADC. We have no assurances from them that they’re going to be able to continue to do that. In fact, what we’ve been orally conveyed is the exact opposite, so yes, the data existed, we relied on the assurances from KIUC that during all phases we’d be able to deliver water. I don’t know what they base that on in terms of their analysis of the data that was at hand. Is that responsive to your question, Commissioner?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"It’s complicated, thank you.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Which is why respectfully and if there was an after analysis of everything that’s gone on, there is abundant blame to cast in many directions. But there’s so much context to this, this is why my initial suggestion was a briefing on the agreement as a whole as well as the current status of the West Kauaʻi Energy Project would allow the Water Commission to make a decision where it sees the relationship between the parts and the whole.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"But rest assured I for one was not casting a lot of blame and finding people to point fingers at but just resolve this as best we can and honor the agreements that we have but also make sensible accommodation when things are different. Dean, correct me if I’m wrong but I appreciate Josh’s testimony on this issue that there’s a material difference, you have an agreement. One is about putting gages out there to give you more information, that hasn’t changed too much. Even though this part of phase one was separated from the commitment of the phase two creation of the utility system, these are material changes in the infrastructure that require permits and approvals not only by us but from Corps of Engineers and so forth. You might want to do it differently knowing that you’re not going to have the phase two that you thought you had back in 2017. I’m sympathetic to that, that’s a little bit different from gages.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"In these cases, because the water and anybody can correct me if I’m wrong, but because the water is going through the hydro system and being returned to the stream, the ditches are being treated as streams in this case per the Army Corps jurisdiction.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"This is your application and your application was based upon a particular project, is that correct?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"The application before you today is for designs that were created to implement the phase one IIFS whether or not the West Kauaʻi Energy Project went forward. As we understood it our commitment was to make sure that those modifications when in place, the phase one IIFS could be implemented by the ditch operator regardless of what happened with the West Kauaʻi Energy Project. That’s what’s in the application.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"For me I will always talk about what’s my lane and in this case my lane is IIFS. It’s to ensure that that’s been met and what I’m hearing you say is that this application even though it is more than just gages, it’s intended to meet the IIFS. Is that correct?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"It’s intended to allow the ditch operator to implement the IIFS, yes. Clarification, implement the IIFS at the point of diversion. In other words the IIFS stays in the stream rather than go into the ditch and then return. That was what we were tasked with doing in our commitment for the phase one as we understood it.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Thank you, Chair for that focus. Dean, back to you. Do you agree given that there’s not going to be a phase two at this point this is the best way to achieve the IIFS objectives that we have? Would you like time to think about it? Some people are asking for deferral and so forth.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"At its face it’ll implement the instream flow standards as per the agreement; however, with all due respect I think our lane is also to make sure that the diversions are installed responsibly and for the purpose that its intended, right? I recognize that there may be, given that phase two may not move forward, there may be concerns about how the diversions are constructed or modified to meet the instream flow standards. I can understand that there is some concerns by KAA and ADC to modify those plans to fit their needs as they move forward in managing the system.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"No, and I appreciate that. I think that that is fair. I know that there are others still that have signed up, but does CWRM have a recommendation based upon what you’re hearing? Do you want to hear other testimony because that’s ultimately going to be my question.",1,B2,01/30/2024
I mean most of the others are in association with the agencies.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"I have a question. I assume that the IIFS was reached by the usual balancing of instream and off-stream uses and if that’s the case what now comes up is that some of the off-stream uses might be affected beyond what the agreement was that sets the IIFS, is that right? Like what Jonathan was concerned about that some of the off- stream users may not get the water that they thought they would be getting. If that’s the case, shouldn’t they be trying to petition to modify the IIFS and if that’s the case, why should we wait for that to come forward when we already have an agreement on what the IIFS should be? There’s always going to be uncertainty about how much water is going to be available so I don’t see why, at least from my point of view, we have to revisit this issue all over again.",1,B2,01/30/2024
As far as the instream flow standards go?,1,B2,01/30/2024
"Dawn, may I ask a question? As part of ADC’s testimony they attached what looks like a press release. Have you seen that as Exhibit A?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I have seen the press release, yes.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"One of the impacts, there were three listed, the third was the water delivery of water for irrigation and other purposes to users along the ditch of which one of them was DHHL, is that correct?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"That was delivery of water through the energy project, not the phase one modification.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I think we’re on phase two, B2 now. CHAIR CHANG: We’re on B2 but I think it’s different than phase one.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Phase one was to implement the instream flow standards as quickly as possible, phase two was...",1,B2,01/30/2024
Does that change the impact of your water or water availability for DHHL?,1,B2,01/30/2024
"No, the phase one modifications are flexible meaning different volumes can be diverted into the ditch. The press release is specific to the energy project which would have delivered all of DHHL’s water reservation actually but would have involved different modifications at the diversions. But the application in front of you is for the phase one IIFS modifications to implement the phase one IIFS and there’s flexibility in the modifications to vary the diversion volumes.",1,B2,01/30/2024
To meet the six million that Jonathan stated earlier?,1,B2,01/30/2024
The modifications themselves they would not prohibit diverting six million gallons of water.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"But at that point you won’t be the operator? DAWN HUFF, KIUC: We would not be the operator, correct.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Dean, do the concerns that are being raised apply equally to all three streams that you’re talking about here or are we isolating one of them or two of them that are problematic and the other’s okay?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I’m not certain, I would ask that of the stakeholders.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I guess the issue I’m having here is that the applicant is making representations for somebody else and to the extent that the operator can’t remedy the situation, what’s the recourse here especially to users like DHHL? I understand how the parties need to be coherent; however, there’s a definite bifurcation once KIUC is done with their application and you have a third party that is given the keys to the car which might be great or not.",1,B2,01/30/2024
That’s a valid point. What troubles me a little is that some of this is speculation. If some of what I heard from Lyle was the reliance on Mr. Gomez’s analysis but his analysis was available over 10 years ago or about 10 years ago. What appears to be the major change circumstance is KIUC is no longer going to do their large project. I do appreciate your point.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"Call upon your attorney background, do principles of attornment apply here that when somebody passes on an asset or the obligations go with them?",1,B2,01/30/2024
That kind of depends upon what the agreement is.,1,B2,01/30/2024
If I buy a piece of land that’s under lease I have to honor the lease.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"But to me underlying all of that is the IIFS. It doesn’t matter who’s the operator, it doesn’t matter. That is the guiding principle.",1,B2,01/30/2024
DHHL has interest in this as well.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"I see Jonathan’s hand is up, we’re having a free flow conversation. Don’t apologize, I think this is helpful.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Thank you very much, Chair. Just to make two very brief points in this conversation, the first is I think the difference between the consideration of...I’m trying to respond to Dr. Miike’s point that wouldn’t it just be our obligation if there’s now not enough water to amend the instream flow standards. Hawaiʻi’s courts have been really clear that there are four public trust uses of water, instream uses are one of them, DHHL is another, that there’s not a priority among them. My concern is that if sticking to the previously agreed to IIFS which may, we’re being told by one party our system operator, may not allow for meeting their deliveries to us. You end up privileging one public trust use over another rather than holding them without one priority even trying to satisfy all of them. I just wanted to throw that out for your conversation to consider that if you burden DHHL with having to petition to amend the instream flow standards to provide for our needs then you are fundamentally placing the burden entirely on one public trust user against other public trust uses. The second thing I wanted to just share was that I am frustrated by this whole process, I had no desire to show up this morning but again we have beneficiaries who are relying on this water now who in some cases have been relying on this water for decades. It’s just super concerning to us and we have a, I believe, fiduciary obligation. If somebody, our system operator is coming to us and saying, hey we won’t have enough water for you, we at least need to speak up in the process.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Let me respond to what Jonathan said. I am assuming that one sets up the IIFS, the opposing uses including instream flows have been considered and so it is not preferring one public trust use over the other. That balancing act should have taken place in the IIFS. If in the implementation of the IIFS it turns out that the assumptions that went into the IIFS are flawed then the burden falls upon the person who thinks they’ve been harmed to apply for modification of the IIFS. My basic point is that this does not favor one public trust use over the other. That act was balanced in the past however flawed that was and the remedy is to come back and say, I want to apply for a change in IIFS because the past one is not right.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Jonathan, do the concerns of DHHL apply to all three streams that are in this report?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I apologize, I’m not able to give a satisfactory answer due in part to the very short fuse that we were given to respond to the concerns raised to us.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Dean, do you know?",1,B2,01/30/2024
All three streams would contribute to the Kōkeʻe Ditch system which...,1,B2,01/30/2024
"If I may real fast, let me just modify that last statement. Kōkeʻe Stream, it was proposed to return all stream flow and so the proposal here is to install a 24-inch diameter HDPE pipe. There would be no diversion from Kōkeʻe Stream contributing to Kōkeʻe Ditch if this were to proceed as presented.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"If we found the other two streams to be kind of problematic, we could still amend this submittal to approve the actions for Kōkeʻe which is undisputed.",1,B2,01/30/2024
If Kōkeʻe was meant to be under the agreement to be fully restored without diversion then the discussions about farmers not getting water do not apply to that stream.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"In the event and I’m not sure we want to but in the event that we want to have further discussion about the other two streams, we could take action today on Kōkeʻe without dispute?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"It’d just be amending that to say, approve three but not one or two or approve two and three.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Thank you, Commissioner. I guess that would be a good example of some of the concerns we have. I don’t think we’re concerned about trying to collect water from Kōkeʻe, but when we look at the long-term maintainability and reliability of the system our concern with that particular flume modification is that we believe it would get actually washed up during a heavy rain. If the system is modified for that flume to cross Kōkeʻe Stream and it gets washed out, it’s going to disrupt the service for a while and we haven’t done the work to figure out how frequent would that kind of flash flood event occur, how quickly could we replace a flume like that if it got washed down the canyon, is the remainder of the system post that modification such that we could affect a temporary fix to allow water to continue in the ditch system even if the flume itself is washed away? That’s a good example, when we’re evaluating it’s not necessarily about the IIFS, it’s also about is the system maintainable and reliably operable, separate, and apart from the IIFS.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I want to just follow, Wayne Katayama raised the issue of KIUC, they’re going to transfer, you’ll become the water purveyor. What better understanding do you need because you’re asking for a deferral of this matter is that correct?",1,B2,01/30/2024
I think we asked for denial but would be perfectly happy with that deferral.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"You were asking for denial, okay.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I think we’d be fine with the deferral. Maybe to back up a step, I think we can come to a discussion and agree on a set of changes that should be acceptable. What we probably want to do probably would cost less actually to implement than what KIUC’s plans are but we just needed to be able to sit down and understand what the requirements are at this point and figure that out.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Listening to this there’s a lot of discussion and uncertainty hinging on a report that many parties including CWRM staff haven’t had time to really evaluate in light of this changing of the operator and the eventual operators comfort with the design. It is our duty to uphold the IFS and enforce these matters but I think in the spirit of trying to support a design that sits with the multiple parties and their multiple concerns, if I can make a motion to provide the parties that time and to come back before us, including having our staff look at this report that was from 2015. A major concern I have if is if it was written in 2015 and then decisions were made in 2017 and an approval was granted in 2020, maybe this is for Mr. Uyehara. Was that recent report updated to reflect those sort of design decisions or is there a new version or are we just looking at a report from 2015 that’s been unearthed?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I think I can answer that question for KAA’s part. There are several steps removed from the hydrological analysis underpinning a lot of our conclusions and the ramifications of the different changes that are being decided. A good example, I think the analysis shows that you cannot actually meet the IIFS for significant portions of the year because there’s just not that much water in the stream to begin with, but if you have Puʻulua Reservoir online, you mediate the flow to end users by use of the reservoir right. The final answer on do the end users at, for example DHHL have reliable access to water depends on all these intermediate factors that are separate from just what the IIFS number is and that can include how reliable is the delivery of water in that system when it’s available, what storage capacity is on the system to tide you over for dry periods. All of those answers sort of hinge on what actually happened with the project. Then to the basic point I think Jonathan made earlier. If a party says, look if we’re in charge of it and we build our infrastructure you will have water, that’s our commitment. Whatever reservations you have at that point if that’s their commitment to make, you can decide to if you want to take that forward. That’s sort of a different way to approach the problem which is what I think he stated was their approach.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Let me get some clarification then. I thought I heard that Kōkeʻe Stream would not be diverted and that’s the point. If it’s not diverted and it still is not having any water at certain times of the year, that’s a natural state. To say that the IIFS has to be a certain amount at a particular point but reflecting an undiverted stream, those are opposite conclusions. The point is that it should be a natural flow of Kōkeʻe Stream, not a specific amount of water at a particular place. I don’t understand why if it’s going to be an undiverted stream, water has to be added to it to reach an IIFS.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Everybody’s head is down, nobody wants to answer that question.",1,B2,01/30/2024
If that’s the case then I don’t see how it’s going to be affecting off-stream users if Kōkeʻe is to return to a natural state. The other way it would affect off-stream users is if their water is artificially put into Kōkeʻe Stream drawing it from either the ditch or someplace else.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"I think in the case of Kōkeʻe, correct me if I’m wrong but it was the infrastructure issues there on that stream that if it were to be implemented as designed and proposed in application there may be concerns about it getting washed out at high flows.",1,B2,01/30/2024
What is getting washed out? Isn’t that separate from the issue about restoring Kōkeʻe to its natural state?,1,B2,01/30/2024
"Right now the diversion is instream so they need to create some way to bypass the stream from the ditch. The ditch flows into Kōkeʻe Stream and then is collected on the other side. In order to bypass that collection system they need to construct some type of flume or pipeline to carry the ditch over and across the stream. So in this case I think the issue that Joshua brought up was only infrastructure-wise as far as future maintenance and concerns about high flows. In other case, I think what he brought up as far as meeting the off-stream needs pertains to the other three streams Kauaikinana, Kawaikōī, and Waiakōali.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I don’t understand it, now the place that will be washed out is where the Kōkeʻe Stream water goes back into the ditch, right?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"What’s the point if you restore Kōkeʻe Stream to its natural state but in that segment between where the ditch goes in and comes out it’s higher than the natural state. If you take out the amount of water going in from the ditch and carrying it out, flowing down how is that going to affect the IFS? There’s no requirement that it has to be the same through the entire stream. Nothing’s even being taken out.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"If you look at page 10 on the submittal, the ditch enters the Kōkeʻe...I can share my screen. Kōkeʻe Ditch enters Kōkeʻe Stream on the left bank of the stream. There’s a dam and a spillway here that would typically have stop logs or planning boards in it to back up the water into this area of the stream. The stream is flowing mauka to makai and would flow across the dam or through the spillway and to ensure that no water is collected from Kōkeʻe Stream the application proposes to install a 24-inch HDPE pipe across the stream channel. I think there were a couple supports that would be located on the edge of the stream channel and then it would continue to flow into Kōkeʻe Ditch on the right bank. That’s the type of concern that Mr. Uyehara raised as far as its design and ensuring that it it’s able to stand up to high flows and other future maintenance concerns.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Dean, and maybe Jonathan was correct it might be a little too late that we should have considered having a briefing, the watershed agreement, the changed circumstance of KIUC. I’m trying to understand that KIUC has determined that they’re not going to do their hydro project. Does that now mean that KAA is now going to operate the system, not KIUC.",1,B2,01/30/2024
We’re not privy to those discussions between KIUC and their process moving forward.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"I think Mr. Katayama raises a point that if we’re going to have a new provider that may be saddled with something that somebody else puts in, maybe they need to have the opportunity to review everything.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I just wanted to respond to your question, KIUC is not the ditch operator now. We would have only become the ditch operator if the West Kauaʻi Energy Project had moved forward, and we would not be the ditch operator. There’s no longer a consideration for KIUC to become the ditch operator now that KIUC is not taking over Kōkeʻe Ditch and doing the hydro.",1,B2,01/30/2024
My understanding based upon your clarification is KAA is the current operator.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"Under the KIUC proposed project that would have been transferred to KIUC, but you’re no longer going to do the project so KAA will continue to be the operator.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"And KAA is now asking for additional time, a deferral because the application was submitted by KIUC based upon a sort of a hydro project that’s no longer going to be built. Since KAA is going to remain to be the operator you now want to reassess what kind of infrastructure you may want to install there to ensure that all the users get adequate water. Is that correct or did I miss something? Is that correct, Joshua?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Chair, I think what Dawn would probably say as she said earlier that they designed phase one separate from whether the energy project would go forward. The scenario that changed in the middle was whether KAA would remain the operator earlier in the process actually. The request was made, and ADC board had granted the request from KIUC to actually plan to remove KAA as the operator even prior to phase two. Just in the intervening period it became clear that if KAA was removed no one would remain to operate the ditch. We remained in the role to operate the ditch, but this was unclear when the designs were being evaluated at the time. The context of us just taking the design evaluation as something we would not have to operate and wouldn’t be responsible for ensuring the delivery assurances, that was our perspective when we evaluated even the phase one design originally. Now that we have very recently figured out that this is going to be in all likelihood permanent and we will be responsible, that of course presupposes we remain the ditch operator for ADC’s infrastructure which our agreement has to be renewed periodically. I can’t say that it’s the permanent situation but at least for now that’s the way we’re evaluating the design is, okay if now that we change perspective to being responsible for delivering the water to the end users in the amounts that they’ve requested and expected to receive even under the agreement, these are our concerns.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I’m a little confused. All of these parties have been involved in these decisions for what seven, almost 10 years and I find it not credible when someone says, oh we never knew we were going to take it over. None of this stuff was set in concrete at the beginning, these were all supposed to be part of the discussion and the decision making, so I just don’t understand why it would come as a surprise to any party that, oh they may be the one that’s running the ditch. But anyway, besides all of that, I’m fine with delaying this a bit but not very much. It seems to me that you’re either going to come to an agreement or not. You’re either going to have decided what the final decision is going to be and since you guys have been involved in this for years, I don’t see why we need to delay it much further than maybe next time.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Chair if I may, this is Dawn Huff again. If I may just make one clarification, the license that we had with ADC had an embedded lease and the lease was tied to KIUC, the execution of the lease was tied to completion of 343 for the West Kauaʻi Energy Project and KIUC taking over the operation of the ditch. KIUC did not contemplate or plan to take over operation of the ditch and our understanding of the license and lease agreement is we would not take over operation of Kōkeʻe Ditch until we initiated construction on the West Kauaʻi Energy Project or until we completed the 343 process and executed the lease for the West Kauaʻi Energy Project. I just want to make that clarification, maybe there’s some internal confusion or misunderstanding between us and ADC, but from our perspective that was our understanding of the terms of the lease.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I too find it a little frustrating that we’re now at this hour and after years of the working group meeting, obviously assumptions were made that the KIUC project was going to move forward, and nobody really put in consideration for other options. Now it’s saddled with the Water Commission when our real role was to ensure that the IIFS is being met and the terms of the settlement agreement are being met, but we’re sort of being asked, okay put a hold on our process to let everybody else catch up. I do find that a little frustrating because it does impact these people who have negotiated in good faith who are relying upon this water. I’m assuming that during this if there is a determination by the commission to grant a deferral that the downstream users including DHHL will not be impacted by the status quo, is that correct, maybe Jonathan?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Yes, that is correct Chair. If I may and this is also in response to the excellent point on frustration with this raised by you and Commissioner Miike. If we did things again perhaps, we would have started to investigate further how our deliveries would continue under a no West Kauaʻi Energy Project, but our investment and our good faith efforts have just been focused on helping the agreement successfully be implemented and that’s where our attention was. It was not, at least on behalf of DHHL, an attempt to deliberately delay the process or obfuscate any issues or do anything against the Commission’s wishes. We were working hard to make sure this would be successful because it was going to allow us to settle lands that were set aside in 1921. We want to see it happen.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I apologize, I’m just going to ask one more question to Joshua. Joshua and Lyle, both of you have raised issues. How much time are you asking?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Just speaking for KAA, I think 60 days probably should be enough at least for us to come to an agreement as to what we think would be a feasible plan going forward. I can’t speak to if there’s engineering work that needs to be done as a result of that and what it would take to prepare that in principal agreement into something that’s a submittal for the Commission to consider, but I don’t think it should take us very long to actually come to an agreement.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I was going to sort of dovetail on what Elena had said earlier about 30 days, but I think 30 days would be good. I think 60 days would be better. I think that would be our position and that’s just to come to agreement on how we should be moving forward. But ADC for our part, I’m not authorized to speak for the board, but I probably could. I know we’re committed to seeing this project through, seeing the terms of the Waimea Watershed Agreement, seeing this through. It’s just with the termination of this portion of the West Kauaʻi Energy Project, it’s thrown a bit of a wrench into what we were planning and now we’re just respectfully requesting a little bit of additional time to sort of regroup, come to some agreement within the working group so that we can move forward.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Dean would the applicant still be KIUC, or would the applicant change?",1,B2,01/30/2024
"That’s a question for the applicant and the other parties, particularly KAA and ADC.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Dean, you need time, too, to write up the reports. If we said it came back here in 60 days and two months that means their agreement has to be achieved like in 30 days so that you have time to craft a new submittal.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I think in that case it Would presume that KIUC is the applicant, and the amendments are made to the application to bring that back in that time frame.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I would agree with that but if this is delayed any further and if they’re asking for more time then I would say that as part of the deferral is that if nothing is brought to us within say 60 days, then we consider the current application as the standing application.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"I would be very interested if KAA is willing to share that report to make sure that our staff or we have access to it because it seems some assumptions, a lot of tension is sort of riding on it.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Okay, Joshua and Lyle can you share that report if you have...have you shared that report with CWRM? Ayron, why don’t you come on up.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Commissioner, Joshua Uyehara again for KAA. The base hydrological analysis was shared as part of the sort of discussions for the mediation and I think the discussion here today was how do you infer what the end result is going to be if this is the condition in the stream for our analysis. We look at the infrastructure that’s planned and we look at other things like whether Puʻuloa would be renovated or not, then what? The report is shared but there’s a whole bunch of steps in between and there’s room for reasonable parties to disagree as to what is going to happen in the end because it’s kind of uncertain. We’re taking what we view as a responsible view on that and opinion on that as a responsible ditch operator. Other people might not necessarily come to the exact same conclusions but whatever information people would be interested, we’re more than willing to share and that’s been what we’ve been doing in the spirit of the mediation process.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Branch. I agree with Josh that the original data that went into establishing the instream flow standards and the availability of water for off-stream uses including for DHHL, it was a modeling exercise that everybody agreed to the assumptions of the model and moving forward that was basically 2016, maybe early 2017 but mostly 2016. The plan was for the agreement to be implemented somewhat rapidly so that we could get monitoring on the ground to verify or update information available that went into the instream flow standards, principally water available at some of these smaller streams that don’t have a USGS gage or maybe had four years of data from 1921 to 1925 which may not be relevant in today’s climate period. There was a little bit of frustration in the delayed implementation because we didn’t get any of the phase one information coming until commission staff went out and actually installed the gages in 2022. We had five years of lost data opportunity and so now with KIUC not moving forward with phase two, I also understand that ADC, they don’t want to be stuck with infrastructure that’s going to be either costly to maintain or impossible to maintain or something they wouldn’t have designed themselves. I don’t want to speak for either entity but maybe KAA can come to some sort of agreement with KIUC where they either they share the costs or KAA decides on what design they would move forward to and they would move forward with the permitting process because there’s Army Corp permits that are needed. KIUC has been bouncing back and forth between agencies, between landowners and they want to just get what was on the books three years ago implemented but that’s not necessarily relevant today because the project, the phase two project, isn’t going to move forward. I also agree that we can come together and evaluate what data we do have now and compare it to what was predicted based on the modeling efforts that KAA did. Maybe we do need to update the IIFS, maybe there are other modifications that would meet the IIFS that aren’t being considered at the moment that KAA would rather implement. There is some wiggle room there and, but I also agree that KIUC wants to just move forward.",1,B2,01/30/2024
They should have moved forward a little earlier.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"Rather than characterize wiggle room like you want to get out of something, I think really what we’re talking about is taking the moment to do something to affirm our commitment and to do it better.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"60 days seems ambitious given what you said Ayron is that the original IIFS was based upon certain assumptions and models with the data that you had. Now you have perhaps hopefully newer data, but you may end up amending that IIFS based upon. Again 60 days and KAA may decide to have a whole different system because they’re now going to have to maintain it. We’re obviously extremely frustrated and I’m hoping Dawn that whoever the applicant is, I mean this was a responsibility of KIUC. I am hoping that KIUC will honor its commitment to work with these entities to come up with something that may be not necessarily what KIUC would have done and what you would have wanted, but moving forward now with these changed circumstances working with KAA and ADC and the other stakeholders on designing something that may be more appropriate given the changed circumstances. But KIUC is going to be a contributor to that process.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Certainly, we’re happy to work with the other parties on other design considerations.",1,B2,01/30/2024
And paying for that?,1,B2,01/30/2024
"KIUC, their commitment is to implement the phase one modifications, so nothing has changed about that commitment.",1,B2,01/30/2024
"Thank you, I really appreciate that. You have now shared that with all of us on the screen. Thank you, I appreciate that, Dawn.",1,B2,01/30/2024
I’m not saying that we need to modify the IIFS with this process.,1,B2,01/30/2024
"Sorry, just to clarify the date so if you were to go with 60 days, that would put us at the end of March, roughly. The earliest that we would bring it back to Commission is at the April Commission meeting.",1,B2,01/30/2024

Thank you very much. I see Avery Chumbley and James Geiger. Did you want to provide any testimony or comments?,1,B3,09/19/2023
"Yes I do, Chair. Chair Chang and Commissioners, thanks for the opportunity to provide both written and oral comments on both B-3 and B-4. Our comments are similar on the pair of the two. My name is Avery Chumbley. I’m the President of Wailuku Water Company. And as I stated back in August, these are the first two SWUPAs that will be delivered off of the Wailuku system since the June 2021 D&O was issued. The other previous three came directly off of the river. We do not object, as we said in August, to the quantities being proposed to the allocation in both of these SWUPAs but Chair we do disagree with the staff submittal that these permit holders would not violate the PUC order as we understand it. In the Ramseyer format on both page 15 and 20 of both submittals, the statement says these SWUPA holders would be a user and not a customer and could not violate the January 9, 2009 PUC order. We still continue to disagree with that, Chair and to that extent, I’d like to ask Jim Geiger to expand on that issue. And also we have Doug Codiga with us today who is our PUC attorney who can provide the additional comments on specifically on those issues.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Good afternoon, Chair and Commissioners. Jim Geiger on behalf of Wailuku Water Company. I want to thank you for your attention; I know it’s been a very long day. You’ve heard a lot of testimonies, so I will try to keep my remarks short. We read the staff report in their meeting with the PUC as addressing only our amended application that was filed last May, May of 2022. We don’t read it as having addressed the Suspension Order that was issued in 2009. And in particular in the Suspension Order, it starts out stating, the status quo shall be maintained and applicants and their affiliates are prohibited from adding any new customers. At that time, Wailuku Water Company didn’t have a category of “users.” We only had a category of customers. And so based upon what was before the PUC at that time, we understand that to include everyone. If we had anyone new, we are not maintaining the status quo and therefore we would be in violation of the PUC suspense order. We’ve asked for the suspense order to be lifted for some time. The PUC has not taken action. If the Commission proceeds forward, we fully expect them filing a motion to specifically lift the suspense order as to the two permit applications that are before it today. We don’t know exactly how long it would take, but we would expect that to happen. For clarification purposes, we could ask for a special condition to be added that states that the permits would be conditioned on the issuance of the lifting of the suspense order from the PUC. We think as a compromise position, simply modifying the standard condition #3, as in our written submittal, to add at the end, “including compliance with the applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Public Utilities Commission” will suffice. And with that, I will stop my comments and be able to respond to any questions you may have.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Mr. Codiga, did you want to add anything? Doug?",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Nothing further to add, Chair. Thank you.",1,B3,09/19/2023
Thank you very much. Do I have anybody else on Zoom who wants to provide comments on this matter?,1,B3,09/19/2023
"Good afternoon, it’s almost evening.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"So it is. Good evening Chair Chang, Commissioners. Like everyone else, I was here for C-1 so I’ll stay on for that but having heard this matter and being a long-time legal practitioner before of course this Commission as well as the Public Utilities Commission, it definitely piqued my interest. I just want to be clear on what was proposed by Wailuku Water Company because I believe they were raising the PUC as potentially as a barrier to the Commission, this Commission issuing a permit. And I heard them proposing some kind of condition on the permit, subject to PUC approval or something like that, but I thought I heard from Dean’s staff presentation that the PUC already signed off on this. As far as they’re concerned, this is not a customer and they’re a user and that, of course, aligns with this Commissions understanding of the kuleana right holders or users on this system where they have a right to the water flowing to this ditch system. They’re not customers of this water company. What I’m hearing is that the Commission understands that, going back to their orders in this case. The PUC understands that and said so in so many words to the Commission staff Acting Deputy. So, what’s the problem here? Let’s just move forward, right? If you have any questions, again because of my decades of experience at least collectively on both these Commissions, please feel free to ask. I thought there’s no problem here.",1,B3,09/19/2023
Appreciate the free legal advice.,1,B3,09/19/2023
"I was going to ask Dean, but what’s the problem with their additional language? It just says it’ll be, if the PUC changes its mind or something, they’re insulated.",1,B3,09/19/2023
Was it that simple as just subject to PUC jurisdiction or whatever?,1,B3,09/19/2023
"What we believe to be PUC’s determination is that matters of water allocation are ours. And if we tell them they have water to allocate, that doesn’t create a harm to Avery folks. So?",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Sorry, is that the...",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Well, I think there were two separate...what I heard Wailuku say. First, I heard one condition being it was subject to PUC lifting, but then I also heard. I would agree. That one made me uncomfortable, but the second one was by Mr. Geiger saying, just comply with our terms and conditions of peace.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"If that’s just some boilerplate provision, you’re just saying the sky is blue, fine. But I heard what you heard as well, which is let’s go through another round of this with the PUC, clarify the distinction between customer and user, no.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"That’s what I heard, that there were two different proposed conditions. One was subject to PUC lifting the condition and then the second one Mr. Geiger said, as a compromise why don’t we just say you comply with all PUC orders, which we are. We are complying with the order.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Did you hear Mr. Meyer? He said, “Who should I send the bill to?” Who are you going to send the bill to?",1,B3,09/19/2023
"As you know, we work pro-bono.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"This is what we appreciate. This collective together, finding a solution. Questions anyone?",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Chair, I’d like to ask either Jim or Doug to opine on that and clarify because what I’m hearing is several different things and I think that they can bring some clarity to what was just debated.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Mr. Geiger, what I heard you say, there was the one condition which was subject to PUC lifting versus you said as a compromise that they comply with all the PUC conditions. Could you just clarify that?",1,B3,09/19/2023
"That’s correct, Chair. We could’ve asked for something, a condition being put on here that it was subject to the PUC lifting of the stay. We thought it was probably, accomplish the same thing by adding just that, comply with all rules, orders, and regulations.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"When we submitted our permit, it did not stipulate that we had to do any PUC requirements.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Yeah, okay, okay. While you’re here, do you want to add to the conversation?",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Now I’m hearing the further explanation, even that language makes me uncomfortable. It might put the onus on these right holders to have to wait while Wailuku Water Company says, you have no right until you go to the PUC get some declaratory action or something like that, you know? Look, just because we’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re out to get us, but we’ve been doing this stuff for Nā Wai ‘Ehā for twenty years and we’ve seen a lot of rigmarole. Let’s just cut through all of this. PUC has spoken clearly, right? This Commission has spoken clearly. These are not customers, period.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Let me ask you, if we get sued by Mr. Chumbley, will you defend us?",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Absolutely, as friends. You might be aware, this is public information, that this shibai about the Water Commission has to defer to the Public Utilities Commission is an issue that the water company has raised on appeal on Nā Wai ‘Ehā case. They’re going to lose.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Okay, we’ll bring this back to order. Thank you very much, I appreciate the additional commentary here.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"If they want to sue, that’s what you have deputy attorney generals for and this issue is tee’d up in other forums for a legal ruling. This is no reason to put these people through further delay and headaches. They asked for a permit, they’re right holders. They should get it. And they’re not customers.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Chair, it’s not the applicant that this decision is putting to risk. What you’re putting to risk is Wailuku Water Company and its operation in its entirety to all of the people who get water through our system.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"Aloha mai kākou, I’m Vicky Holt Takamine. I’m a Native Hawaiian activist. I now have a new title, vigil aunty. My question is, is Wailuku Land Company a traditional customary practitioner? Do they comply with giving water back to where it came from? According to our kānāwai, traditional land use, and water use. If you take water out, you have to bring it back to the system in the same condition so people down the way can use the water. Farmers, fisherman, all the natural...are they complying to that? Or do they just suck off the water for their own use? These are Native Hawaiian traditional customary practitioners who want to continue kalo farming, who have a right to that water. Wailuku doesn’t own it. You don’t own that water. It’s not yours. You need to share like we have shared with everybody that comes. You don’t have any rights to that. Period.",1,B3,09/19/2023
I appreciate the manaʻo. Do I have anybody else?,1,B3,09/19/2023
"Chair, I just get one question. I wasn’t going to stand up, but all this...",1,B3,09/19/2023
"This is the third person who told me, I wasn’t going testify, but you come up.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"I’m drowning in all this water. Bottom line is, I like know what year Wailuku Water Company took over the water because it sounds like this family goes to the 1800s. Was Wailuku Water Company in the 1800s?",1,B3,09/19/2023
You can ask us and we can ask them.,1,B3,09/19/2023
"Ok ask them because I don’t know. Because if they’re not then, they’re not even listening to what your staff just said? The PUC, they’re not customers. I mean come on, I graduated Campbell backdoor, but I understand. I understand what was just said. It’s clear as day. The only thing they’re muttering is it’s their water. Now this one’s clear. Thank you, Chair.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"I appreciate that. With that being said, Commissioners...",1,B3,09/19/2023
"It sounds like basically this. This is my little one’s when we started, when all of this started, when we were awakened in 2019. Whether it’s ʻāina, whether it’s wai, whether it’s ‘iwi kupuna, it’s the same thing. It seems to me that when you have either a little one or generational families, what we’re hearing right now, the families who want to go back and practice their culture, they have the right to do so. Yet as soon as you put this on, different dress, different motives, and then you get this added in. When you have this here, whether it’s hidden kind of there so those who are in front can see. Whether you come with it in here, pocket, side pocket, envelope, whatever it comes in. It seems that this, what we continue to see, this over this. When it should be this way around. And that’s all I wanted to say.",1,B3,09/19/2023
"I do want to make an addition to the staff submittal. I would like to add a recommendation #5, that the board find that Jodie Mundy has established that her family has lived on the ridge of Malaʻihi Road in Wai‘ehu ahupuaʻa for more than three generations where her family has cultivated kalo and the practice was handed down from her grandparents. Additionally, she has provided information that her planned use is not for commercial purposes, therefore she has established a traditional customary practice. In addition, Michele Ho‘opi‘i, who is also exercising traditional customary practices has also provided supportive, factual testimony to support Jodie Mundy’s assertion that she is exercising traditional customary practices.

Just wanted to add that my family does have a long history there in Wai‘ehu, Malaʻihi Road, specifically the area that we’re talking about, the Land Commission award is a little bit more in the cane field. As I have put it in my application, I am the sixth generational, lineal descendant of the original awardee, who was given the title for the property that I am requesting water for. I’d like to make it clear that I am not a customer. We are kuleana families that have been here for generations. We’ve had water coming to our property since then, since the Mahele. And because of the different water ways that were diverted and interrupted from the plantation era to present, we have since lost our water to the property, so that is why I’m here requesting my application be approved.

And then I wanted to just expand on the chapter  this is Chapter 1, Oʻahu Water Management Plan overview, which is the island water use and development plan. And then Abbey is going to then jump into the regional watershed plan, which is East Honolulu, talk about the planning process and schedule, the Watershed Profile Chapter 2, and the current and future water demands in East Honolulu, the specific objectives, and basically policies, project  projects and strategies and how we plan to implement it.And then we're just about ready for the public review draft. We just went through an agency review draft with the commission staff and the Department of Planning and Permitting, and then the approval process is how we think we are going to get the plan approved through city council and the commission, and then the Q & A at the end. Next. So the status of the plans, as you may know that we're instead of one island plan, we're doing eight. We've because it allows us to take a deeper dive into each region and come up with place-based strategies and projects and align better with the city land use plans. But we've so far got Waiʻanae, North Shore, Koʻolau Loa, and Koʻolau Poko Watershed Management Plans approved by the commission and accepted into Ordinance Chapter 30. We still have South Oʻahu still pending, and we apologize for the delay, but we're trying to address climate change, and so this East Honolulu is our first chance to actually tell you about what we've done to try to build that into some scenario planning. Next. So you're familiar with this, but I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper into this. Of course, the state water code, the general plan, and the legal..regulatory framework. A little bit on the Hawai‘i Water Plan, you're familiar with the four components that the county water use and development plan has to account for, include the state findings of the other state plans. You know, just the name of the county water use and development plan per se is somewhat limiting, although it's broader, but in the tight, it's basically a plan for water use and development, basically how much  where's the water, how much do you need, and how are you gonna get it there? And so it should incorporate management of water and conservation and protection and restoration. And so the council back in 1990 either renamed it or named it the O‘ahu Water Management Plan, and this is the framework. A little bit of the statewide framework of 2000, there is a Section 3-26 that allows for flexibility, for innovation to accommodate unique and county-specific concerns tailored to each county, and so that's why we broke it up into eight regional plans. In July of 2022, there was a presentation on some of the updates that could be made to the statewide framework. Those gaps were climate uncertainty, applying indigenous knowledge, ag water, plan utility, and integrating land use and water policies and agencies into the plan. And by breaking it up into these regional watershed management plans, we feel that we've addressed a large part of thatAnd so you may know that Oʻahu's broken up in the general plan into eight land-use districts. There are two development plan areas that are primarily urban center, basically Honolulu and then ʻEwa are the directed growth  directed growth areas, so all the growth is directed to these areas, and that's where our infrastructure investment is concentrated. The other six land use districts are rural and urban fringe, so it's to keep the country country by moving the development towards, you know, those two districts. And the specific policies in these land use plans that are incorporated in these regional plans, they're  these regions are very different, and so we are able to tailor each of the regional plans to the specific regions. And Act 152 for Watershed Protection, the Waiāhole Ditch Decision, the ordinance Chapter 30, our mission, you know, all provide guidance into the plan. And recently, the Mayor's Climate Change and Sea Level Rise Directive of 2018 and it was updated in 2022, I believe, brings in guidance on what to do with sea level rise. And the Ola Oʻahu Resilience Strategy is how we make the  Oʻahu more resilient to climate change, including, you know, the facilities, but also the resources. And so today, I'm talking about East Honolulu. So, next. So we've adopted the ahupuaʻa model in these.. watershed plans. I call it systems thinking, but it could  you know, the way I look at it, the goal is watershed health, holistic resource management, and self-sufficient and sustainable communities. We recognize that there's an interrelationship between mauka and makai, including the coastal resources, the conservation districts, the ag zones, the urban zones, and the nearshore waters, but also, what happens aboveground may affect what's underground in terms of contamination. What sets the ahupua'a model apart from traditional integrated resource plans is  the stewardship and kuleana that comes with the ahupua'a model around land, water, people, and culture. It's the culture that affects behaviors, and by improving those behaviors towards conservation, no waste, recognition of where water comes from, restoration of cultural sites and fishponds and kalo, you know, all of those get folded into these behaviors so that it  basically is the glue that supports the  what's in the plan. Okay. So, next. So our goal is  to balance the preservation and restoration, and management of Oʻahu watersheds, right, mauka to makai, with a sustainable ground and surface water use and development to serve present and future generations. In Chapter 1, we define this goal. We also define the five objectives of which are all  which are applied to all of th plans. The objectives are defined, and they are our  are defined as our future state, I guess. So what does a sustainable watershed look like? So promoting that, protecting and enhancing water quality and quantity; protecting Native Hawaiian rights and traditional and customary practices; facilitating public participation, education, and project implementation  and this is the behavior side that I was talking about from the ahupua'a model  and then meeting water demands at a reasonable cost. Each of these objectives drive specific policies, projects, and strategies in each of the eight regions and  and if it wasn't  you know, we're trying to make it explicit. It's not just happens if you do something; we're directly trying to meet these objectives in each of these regional plans. Okay, next. So I just wanted to talk about the  Chapter 1. Next. Chapter 1 was basically the  essentially, the same format as the first adopted O‘ahu Water Management Plan in 1990. The water code was adopted in ’87. So Chapter 1 is the  the islandwide water use and development plan. It also incorporates  what the commission did was hire Peter Adler, and he came up with the  you know, his Adler report on O‘ahu needs in 2020. So the  so the format and the  the organizational structure is very much aligned with that, andthis is in every plan. So we talk about authority and purpose, the framework which I went through in the water use and development plan, which talks about islandwide demand forecasts, supply availability for urban and agriculture, conservation, existing and planned sources, alternatives and transfers, and I believe there's a discussion about how we transfer water around the island because we have the infrastructure to do that. The Adler report talked about certain uncertainties such as in-stream and appurtenant rights, Hawaiian Homeland alternative source costs, alternative source impacts to aquifers, and the recharge rates and  and pumping effects to streams. What we added here is a contingency section that offers a list of strategies on what to do about it. And so I would encourage you to read that when the public review draft comes out, and I'll get into that in more detail. The plan implementation is how we allocate water, how we invest in infrastructure, you know, the reasonable and beneficial uses is defined first through the water use permits, and then we allocate water on a first-come, first-served basis with an adequate facilities review. I might add that when we do allocate water, we also look at reasonable and beneficial uses, ensure that conservation measures are employed, ensure that  require them to connect.to recycled water systems if they're adjacent before we can  before we issue the meter. So it's conditional to those types of uses. Next. In the uncertainties and contingencies, we describe what some of the  you know, all the uncertainties that we could think of that have been affecting planning over the last couple of decades. Estimating and recovering sustainable yield is  it's one  you folks were talking about estimating sustainable yield; how do we recover that? And you can't recover it all in a lot of places. How does climate change and drought impacts affect recharge and sustainable yield, and what to do about it? Contamination, of course Groundwater-dependent ecosystems are brought up the last  in the last administration, so we have a section on that Basically, sustainable yield is a percent of recharge. The remaining percent is allowed to flow to the ocean to support these ecosystems, and that  you know, we had some strategies around that I know there's some interim in-stream flow standards, effects on stream flows, and protection and restoration there Drought impacts to stream flows and the diversions and use, so it's conjunctive use of using stream diversions and wells, you know, in drought times to  so you can maximum the stream flow. How do you make ditch irrigation systems more efficient through piping the ditches? And then uncertainties around urban and agricultural demands. Urban is fairly  you know, it's  you know, everybody wants to bank water, so they end up having the demands high. I see agricultural demands as having a wider range. But anyway, we have these sections where we tried to estimate uncertainties and provide some solutions so  on an islandwide basis. Okay. The next slides, I'm gonna turn it back over to Abbey to get into the East Honolulu regional plan. Thank you.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Great. Thank you so much, Barry, for providing that context. As he mentioned, the remainder of the presentation, I will be zoomed in specifically to the East Honolulu Watershed Management Plan.  So just a little bit of background in terms of the planning process to develop this regional plan. This  our process is  was divided up into five key phases  starting off with the research and identification of the key water resource issues for the district, then moving into an analysis of the  both existing and future water supply, and Then moving into the development of both the agency and public review draft, and obviously we'll end on the development and adoption of the final plan. Having throughout this process, having stakeholder consultations as well as four different community meetings. As a quick note about the schedule, we did begin this process in early 2019, and with this year  at the beginning of the year, we had released the agency review draft, recently integrated feedback from that, and will be soon releasing the public review draft, and are looking to hopefully have the plan adopted by the end of this year. As mentioned, we've had stakeholder consultations throughout this process with both community organizations that work in the district on various activities related to watershed health, as well as county and state agencies, in addition to regular neighborhood board presentations to the district's three neighborhood boards, and in addition to the community meetings that were just mentioned. So now I'll be moving into Chapter 2, which really sets the foundation for the plan as it provides a profile of the district's eight  ten different watersheds. And as mentioned, as Barry mentioned, this plan takes a very comprehensive view of watershed health, so this chapter really digs into all the different historical, cultural, environmental factors that impact watershed health. As  just as a quick kind of context, the district again encompasses ten different watersheds and spans from Kahala to Makapu'u. Through our process of both research as well as stakeholder consultations, this Chapter 2 really kind of culminates around eight different water resource issues that kind of rose to the top of the community's priorities in terms of issues that are impacting watershed health in the area, and those are including climate change, sea level rise, nearshore water quality, flooding and drainage, wildfires, and others that are listed here. And so, while I don't have time in this presentation to get, obviously, into all of those topics, I just wanted to highlight within this plan that we do provide both analytical as well as spatial data both analytically and spatially to discuss these different topics that were just mentioned. For example, to kind of better understand both opportunities and challenges for topics such as cultural resources, our team both mapped out historical and existing resources such as fishponds, freshwater springs, heiaus, as well as the traditional ahupua'a boundaries. And then as another example, to better understand the topic of wildfire hazard, in addition to both mapping out where recent wildfires have occurred, we're also mapping out the wildland-urban interface to better understand wildfire vulnerability. And so, both of those are just examples to show the type of in-depth analysis that we went through for all the different factors that were presented in Chapter 2. So moving on to Chapter 3, as mentioned, this content is focused on understanding both the existing as well as the future water demand and supply and understanding how that essentially impacts the water source availability for the district. As I'm sure the commission knows, East Honolulu area encompasses two different groundwater aquifer system areas, the Wai'alae West and Wai'alae East, which combined have a relatively low sustainable yield at 4.5 million gallons per day. Historically, over the last about 30 years, the district has used more water per capita than the islandwide average. For example, in 2010, East Honolulu residents, on average, used about 194 gallons per water per person per day, which is about 25 percent higher than the islandwide average. So in total, and this map is showing the Board of Water Supply transfers based on 2013 to 2017 averages, the district used an average of about 8.38 million gallons per day of Board of Water Supply water, with the majority of that water being supplied by transfers from the Honolulu sources, and a smaller amount of that being supplied by transfers from Windward in addition to in-district pumping, which accounts for about 16 percent of the Board of WaterWater Supply water demand. Just kind of quickly to note in regards to the water uses, the majority, as you can see here, is for residential uses, with a smaller amount going towards commercial uses. And in terms of specific water users of Board of Water Supply water, the largest user is the Hawai‘i Kai Golf Course. So next, moving into future water demand, to project future water demand, we came up with a range of different scenarios, three different scenarios to project water demand in the year 2040, the low, mid, and high, and then two different water demand scenarios for the year 2100. We don't necessarily have the time here to get into all the specific details of these water demand scenarios, but the low demand scenario does represent the most probable as it follows the city's population projections as well as the anticipated water conservation efforts; whereas, the mid demand and high demand scenarios include potential other futures considering if population were to increase or water conservation were to be decreased in certain ways. Additionally, the ultimate demand scenarios include factors such as the impacts of sea level  of 3.2 feet of sea level rise as well as the differences in rainfall projections with two different sub scenarios being based on the wet rainfall projection as well as the dry So based on our analysis, we find that the low demand, the  again, that one being the most probable, would result in an estimated 8.5 million gallons of water used per day, total water usage, and obvious  again, the mid and high scenarios are unlikely that they would be proliferated, but we anticipate that in the mid scenario, there would be about 9.6 million gallons per day, and the high would be 11.96 million gallons per day. In summary, based on our analysis of comparing the  essentially, the water demand with the anticipated water supply in 2040, we have found that in the most probable scenario, there would be existing  the existing water supply would be adequate, but in the high or mid or high demand scenarios, that this would require additional water resources or improved water efficiency. Similarly, in the ultimate demand scenario, even though it is obviously more difficult to project out water supply, it  in  at such a great time distance from 2100, we estimate that under the wet scenario, because of  because of anticipated increased rainfall, there would be adequate water supply, and in the dry scenario that there would need to be improved water efficiency to meet the water demand. So kind of all this is to say in terms of our key takeaways from this water analysis that both kind of under theexisting situation as well as the future scenarios, that even though we do project that East Honolulu would have adequate supply under the most probable scenario, that due to their limited in-district supply, they have a heightened kuleana to user water efficiency  efficiently due to the impacts that water transfers can have on the districts that they're being transferred from. So next, I'll be moving into Chapter 4, which is focused on the goals, policies, as well as descriptions of the projects, programs, and strategies to achieve those goals and objectives. As a quick note regarding how these policies, projects, and strategies are all related, some of those  the water resource issues that were discussed previously in this presentation that were highlighted in Chapter 2, as well as the results of the water demand analysis informed the district's sub-objectives. From there, the projects with champions as well as the general strategies essentially align with those sub-objectives and are used to advance  advance those policies, and from  from all of those projects emerged the catalyst projects, which are essentially the  the vehicle being  we see as being used to implement the projects and strategies. As a note, we have identified 30 different projects with champions, so these projects with champions haveither an existing community or government champion who has been slated to carry out these efforts. And they cover a wide range of activities such as fishpond restoration, heiau restoration, coral assistant evolution, invasive species removals, and so forth. And just as  again, wanted to point out that these projects are both site-specific; we have about nine  we have nine projects that are site-specific with the remaining 21 projects being focused districtwide. So at a lower tier than the projects, we have the strategies and programs. And so while these activities are also slated to advance the sub-objectives that we've identified in the plan, they do not have an existing project  they do not have an existing community or government champion; however, they are, you know, still important for advancing the objectives that were outlined in the plan. So lastly, Chapter 5, we're moving into implementation. This chapter discusses the water use and development plan, so essentially goes into more detail regarding some of the topics discussed in Chapter 3 around the strategies for ensuring water source adequacy for the region, and then goes into the priority watersheds, the catalyst projects, implementation entities, and potential funding. So for the purposes of this presentation, I'll focus on the catalyst projects, which are essentially just a higher Priority project that will provide the energy and connectivity for the different projects and programs that we've outlined in this plan. Some components of these projects will be focused in priority watersheds, which we're defining as watersheds that require special protection for water quality or provide special opportunities for implementing watershed management programs. For the East Honolulu Watershed Management Plan, we have identified two key catalyst projects. The first is to improve water quality in Maunalua Bay, which came up repeatedly in our consultations with community groups as well as our government stakeholders. We're looking to focus that catalyst project in the priority watersheds, essentially the six watersheds within the district that feed into the bay. The second catalyst project is to increase water efficiency, stemming from our water demand analysis, emphasizing that water conservation is key in the district. For each of these catalyst projects, we identify measurable goals to achieve through these projects, including reducing the amount of invasive algae and increasing the amount of healthy living coral, among others. I wanted to emphasize that this catalyst project...sing the implementation of it within these priority watersheds that feed into the bay, and this  this catalyst project, we've identified various different actions to achieve and carry out the catalyst project. Many of these actions have actually been previously identified by the Moanalua Watershed Hui, which is essentially a collective of community groups that are working to improve the quality of the bay. So I wanted to highlight, as you can see from that last map, these actions are both located in both mauka and makai areas. For example, in the Wailupe Watershed, we've identified the Wailupe Watershed stream restoration as one of the key actions. In the Niu Watershed in the upper watershed, we've identified watershed fencing, mid  the middle watershed invasive species removal and native out-planting, and then in the lower watershed, the invasive algae removal, which is being carried out by Malama Maunalua. Kuli‘ou‘ou, we identified ongoing fishpond restoration as well as watershed retention and infiltration in the upper watershed. In Haha‘ione, we've identified wetland and heiau restoration, which is currently being carried out. And lastly, in the Kamilo Nui and Kamilo Iki, identified a range of actions, including reforestasustainable agricultural pilot project, as well as restoration of Kuapā Pond. So moving now into Catalyst Project No. 2, again, we  which is to increase water efficiency in East Honolulu, again, we identified measurable goals, which include maintaining East Honolulu's per capita water demand through 2040 at 170 gallons per person per day, and then a longer range goal to reduce per capita water demand to 130 per  gallons per person per day by 2100. So these actions that carry out this catalyst project are looked at a more districtive view from both increasing essentially water efficiency from the distributors as well as the water users. I can say with the exception of the action we've identified in the Koko Head Watershed, which is developing R1 recycled water for large irrigation users in Hawai‘i Kai. So I wanted just to note that within the plan itself  I know that was kind of a very quick overview of a lot of information, but within the plan itself, we want to make this as action-oriented as possible, and so we do include essentially a matrix that serves as an action plan and identifies the goals, champions, potential partners, the status, the costs, and target implementation for each of these actions identified as part of the two catalyst projects. So lastly, I wanted to end on just a few updates Regarding the public review draft and our timeline for approval. So as our next steps to the public review draft, we are very close to releasing it online. We anticipate making that publicly available by the end of next week on the Board of Water Supply project webpage. We also are underway in terms of presenting the public review draft to the district's three neighborhood boards, and we'll also be holding a virtual community meeting on the draft on August 24th from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. And lastly, I wanted to turn it over to  back to Barry to provide a little bit more of a detail on  on the approval process with the city and the state commission. Thank you.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Thank you, Abbey. Just wanted to get through the adoption process. So once we do the public review draft, and we obtain the comments and revise the plan accordingly, you know, we then submit it  we present it to our board, we present it to PPP, and the water commission, but  you know, I apologize for the complexity of the flowchart on the bottom right, but just to explain the city council adoption. And this is adopted by ordinance. There are five touchpoints. There are three readings, first, second, and third reading. The third reading is adoption. The first reading is just an introductionbetween the  those readings are two committee meetings, and the committee is planning and sustainability. That may be outdated; this is an older graphic. What we're trying to do is have some interaction between the public meetings, the council meetings, and the water commission public hearing. The timeframes historically have been different. So the city council, once we  once we get the neighborhood board endorsements, the city council in the past has processed and adopted the plan within about three months. So we were thinking that if we could notice the public hearing prior to us submitting it to council, and then that the public hearing would then occur such that in the  in the first meeting, we can say  we gather input, and then at the water commission public hearing, we can provide that input for the record. And then we go to the city council's second committee meeting, the input that we get at the water commission's public hearing can then be made record of, you know, in the  in the city council process. Because what we wanted to do is get that interaction before the  before the council adopts it as ordinance because once it's adopted as ordinance, it's hard to change. So we want to ensure that there's interaction and there's discussion there. And so after it's adopted by council, then it  then it'll be submitted for adoption at the water commissionThis is what we tried last time, and I think the public hearing occurred after all of the committee meetings. We were lucky that it went through, but anyway, that's what we're trying to do. If the staff feels that it's appropriate to notice the public hearing so that we can time the actual public hearing in alignment with the city council adoption, I think it took six months for the commission because of the 90-day notice the last time. So, anyway, that's the approval process, and I think that's the last slide there, Abbey. We're available for questions if there are any.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"A little longer than we thought, 30 minutes, but that's okay. Commissioners, any questions? Oh, Aurora.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Just a quick question given what Barry said about East Honolulu having the highest per capita water use and then in the East Honolulu plan, there wasn't a—I'm curious why there isn't more aggressive reduction of per capita water use because it's not aligning for me what Barry said and what Abbey said on the projected demand being stable or decreasing my words are not coming together. I'm a little tired. So basically, why is there not more aggressive reduction of per capita water use in the plan?",0,B3,07/26/2023
"It would  we were tying the reduction in per capita based on the amount of supply that we thought we would have, and so what we did in the  in our water research foundation study, we took the  the USGS recharge rates and  applied that to the UH 2100 forecast, the rainfall forecast, right? One wet, one  dynamical was wet; statistical was dry. And we  and then we calculated roughly what the sustainable yields would be in both scenarios, yeah. So in the low  I mean, in the dry scenario, the sustainable yields dropped by something in the range of 30 percent, and so reducing the amount of supply available to East Honolulu, we felt that bringing it down to 130 per capita would be sufficient for the demand to  to, you know, align with the  what we think the supply may be.  Now, these scenarios that's 80 years away, and there's gonna be other, you know, evaluations of sustainable yield. There are other  there are other cities that can go to a hundred per capita. And, in fact, when you see primarily center, because of the density, we think we can go down to a hundred. But in East Honolulu, there's a lot of large properties, a lot of swimming pools up there, so it's harder to get it lower. But if you can get the golf course off the potable system and onto recycled water, that will do a lot better. Ala Wai Golf Course has their own well. But the effluent at the Hawai‘i Kai Resource Treatment Plant is salty; they have to desalinate that, and the sea level rise is gonna make it worse, so that will be challenging. But we tied it to what we thought was the available supply, so",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Okay. Larry, go ahead.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Yeah. So basically, your answer is that to East Honolulu, you're only gonna get a certain amount of water, and you've gotta live with that, and that's why you're getting a decrease.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Yeah. And historically, it has been decreasing down from 190  the 170 is  when we started to calculate the 2020 numbers, they're actually at 170 now. And they can get a little bit lower with our rebates and stuff, but that's how we would do that rather than desalination because we're doing that, you know, at ‘Ewa. So instead of increasing or augmenting the supply, it's easier to just try to get their demand down to what we think would be available.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"I've got a question. Oh, go ahead, Neil.",0,B3,07/26/2023
I couldn't go through your list of stakeholders consulted fast enough to see. Was Kamehameha Schools on that list as the largest private,0,B3,07/26/2023
Is it their landowner?,0,B3,07/26/2023
"It should be, yeah, they own the majority of the land.",0,B3,07/26/2023
They own the golf course. Is it their  is that golf course lease renewal kind of part of their  is that an assumption?,0,B3,07/26/2023
Has there been discussion with them to see if that's the highest and best use of that land in terms of their unique mission?,0,B3,07/26/2023
"No, we didn't talk about  as far as I remember, we didn't talk about changing or, you know, closing the golf course. It was trying to supply it with an alternative source.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"You might want to just broach the discussion with them. I'm not saying it's an easy  it's an easy  there's a lot of reliance and acceptance of the golf course, but given their mission, what it provides for their mission is fairly limited in relationship to the impact of this being the largest water user in  in that area. And granted, yeah, if they could get off potable, that would be helpful to this equation, but by the same token, that's a lot of land that might be  have a more powerful contribution to their mission if redeployed.",0,B3,07/26/2023
I'm gonna be a little bit more candid.,0,B3,07/26/2023
"I'm putting on my DLNR hat. You know, your report just emphasized the disparate treatment. We ask  I mean, here we are assuming that that golf course  and we can let East Honolulu continue to take more water than the rest of the island, and we are not  I mean, when I look at your Catalyst No. 1, that are  that's all conservation, environmentalists, culture groups who are willing to put, you know  I don't know who's funding all of this. I suspect they're all going out and getting private funds.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"They're getting federal funds. But I do not see a like  a like response by your largest users, the swimming pool guys, the golf course guys. I mean  but it just  when I look at one end of the  one end of the island, I look at  I look at Leeward Oʻahu, everything is getting dumped over there, and those guys on the  on the leeward side, they have a little bit of water for agricultural, which is sustainable. But on East Honolulu, we're paying for swimming pools and a golf course. I mean, I am sorry, I'm  because I struggle with that at DLNR.we are struggling with water management  watershed management plans. How  our struggle is how do we charge the users an equitable amount for their impacts to our watersheds?  And I guess I just  I'm frustrated because I don't see a like  a like kind of appreciation when, you know, here in  I don't  I guess I just don't see that there is a  a measurable response to those who are using the most. But yet I've got all of these nonprofit groups running out there trying to get money to do these wonderful projects, and I don't see government trying to, you know, tell  I think, you know, it's like Neil says, maybe Kamehameha Schools has to rethink that, or maybe the swimming pools.  But I don't know, Barry and Abbey, is there  I mean, what  what kind of efforts is BWS  you know, do we just ask nicely or do  or do we just turn off the stick? I mean, like I said, I'm tired; this has been kind of a long morning, but I  yet, I'm struggling at DLNR because we have the same issues, and I'm trying to tell these large landowners, you've gotta pay  you have to pay for watershed management on East Maui.",0,B3,07/26/2023
How do  how is this  how is this equitable here?,0,B3,07/26/2023
"Good question. You know, two thie going into the next water rate increase in the next month, and, you know, the golf courses—the three golf courses that irrigate with potable water right now from our system—they're gonna—you know, they may go out of business, man, I don't know. It's gonna increase their water costs, they're gonna have to raise rates, you know, and so, you know, that may be a way to—well, certainly when prices go up, people use less. And they've been trying to use less. I know the golf course provides an income stream to Kamehameha Schools to further their educational mission. They have the—they own the areas around Koko Marina as well, you know. Those—those commercial properties—in fact, there was a presentation last night at the Hawai‘i Kai Neighborhood Board where—led by, I guess, Michelle Swartman and her team on revisioning—their entire properties, you know, in East Honolulu. Most of them—most of the lands are mauka, as Commissioner Hannahs knows, and, you know, they're trying to fold in culture and—but also supply, you know, funding for their—for their educational needs. So they're just starting in that process. You know, those are real good questions, what's gonna happen with the golf course? And that's—we kind of—in the plan, we tried to react to that. We did do an investigation on recycled water for the golf course, this is with American Water, which isprivate company that owns the wastewater treatment plan, and the previous owners of the golf course, and it wasn't economically feasible. You know, they need an influx of grants or something to put in the treatment so they can use it. But we were trying to help  or I was trying to help their discussion. But I hear what you're saying; there is an equity issue there, but they're gonna have to pay the higher rates like everybody else, and the big users are gonna feel it, and then they're gonna have to conserve more or pay the bill.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"I'll be clear, Barry, especially with my background, I'm  I would not want to see Kamehameha Schools treated unfairly or",0,B3,07/26/2023
"in this, but I think they have the potential to be a catalyst project as well. And it's gonna take dialogue. And you've got good people like Michelle there to work with. Just gotta, you know, catalyze  make that dialogue happen and see where it goes.",0,B3,07/26/2023
We'll express that to them.,0,B3,07/26/2023
"Going off of Chair Chang's comment, given East Honolulu's reliance on transfers Are projects  I mean, how is the Board of Water Supply kind of addressing the dependence of the district, you know, on other water management areas that can't reap the benefits of these particular projects? Like, is there a way  because it's probably  the income, you know, disparity of East Honolulu versus ‘Ewa, you know, we don't  is there consideration of that kind of transboundary reliance and ability to build in sort of reciprocity in that to support  to recognize the reliance of East Honolulu on conservation activities, say, in Honolulu or Ko‘olau Poko to maintain their subsidized water supply?",0,B3,07/26/2023
"You know, it would have been  it would have been easy to just say we'll just get more water from Windward, but it's not there. So they have to pull their load, you know, conserve kuleana, that one slide, they need to be more efficient. We didn't  what we  we also have two well projects in the Wai‘alae West and Wai‘alae East Aquifers too to supplement. So it's not only reliant on  on transfers and conservation. There are two small well projects that we  we have on the books. But, yeah, the  in the Ko‘olau Poko and Ko‘olau Loa Watershed Plans, there's a policy in those plans about the transfer of water out of these districts shall not be detrimental to these districts. That's the only way we could get the plans adopted and endorsed by the neighborhood boards. There. So that message was communicated to East Honolulu. What we got back was like, ""Hey, we're conserving, you know, and  well, yeah, but you can conserve more."" We have a rebate program for rain barrels; the stormwater utility is going  they're very interested in green infrastructure and trying to recharge the aquifer too. So the community there is very surprising; they're very motivated and very active in their activities around the coast and in these cultural sites and, you know  more so than I see in other communities, too. It's just the big users like, I think, Commissioner Hannahs was talking about it, and Chair was talking about, and, you know, we can  we can probably talk to them and see how that can be resolved. They tried developing sources. It's all salty aquifer water, so it's not irrigatable. But anyway, this is what we've done so far.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Sorry, a follow-up quick question asking  remind me, the Board of Water Supply is a member of the watershed partnerships?",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Yes. The Ko'olau Mountain Watershed Partnerships, yes.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Yeah. And does that mean financial, like, support",0,B3,07/26/2023
So that is in some way,0,B3,07/26/2023
"Yes. We provide annual funding to  because of Act 152, and because we created a stakeholder advisory group with folks like Mark Fox in there, you know, the big advocates for watershed protection, we're funding about 300,000 plus to the Ko‘olau and the Wai‘anae Mountain Watershed Partnerships as well as the O‘ahu Invasive Species Committee, and some funding also is going to DLNR DOFA for on-the-ground projects. Invasive species control like Miconia, Albizia removal, and fencing. And that's an annual thing that we continue to do with  with our budget. So in a way, you know, the rates are funding that investment in the mauka so that we can continue to make the forests healthier.  Okay, thank you.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"By the way, we're highlighting Kamehameha Schools' tenant's use of the water, but Kamehameha Schools is probably also your largest contributor statewide to watershed partnership investment of any organization, so   Yeah, (inaudible).",0,B3,07/26/2023
"I guess, Barry and Abbey, I think one The policy that I see missing is environmental justice. Since you have an islandwide  while you have these eight water management systems, it is an islandwide system that you have. There should be some level of environmental justice that perhaps how you allocate the costs  I mean, you know, again, it just kind of pains me when I think about the agricultural users down the west end who  you know, who are asked to conserve or we may not even have water for ag, yet on the east side, we've got  and I'm sure they're motivated, I'm sure they're doing their best, and they're trying, but I think there's gotta be some policy that drives a more equitable both distribution  either distribution of water or distribution of costs so that, you know, some of these  these other areas, maybe their water rates are less because they're using less. I don't know. But this slide, this presentation, I'm sorry, was a stark reality check that  I don't know if a lot of people, you know, see the stark disparity in  in East Honolulu versus West Honolulu. And I know you guys are caught between a rock and a hard place, but I mean, I think we, as government, have got to try to do  do things differently when we can see such disparity  I mean, that  we've got all these guys on the west  on the west end on  you know, they're on like drought and water conservation, so  but I am not  I'm not just criticizing you guys. I mean, I..",0,B3,07/26/2023
"I think we're all faced with this, but I would  Can I  if you're referring to the per capita demand higher than the average, yeah, you know, they are, but they're not the highest. You know, North Shore and Wai‘anae actually are higher because of the diversified ag that we serve off of our system, yeah.",0,B3,07/26/2023
But certainly East Honolulu should have that capacity to use less.,0,B3,07/26/2023
"Right, right, right. You're right, yeah.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Maybe we need  we need to focus our incentive program to these hot spots, perhaps.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"But I think the big-ticket items are the large users and, you know, addressing that  may go a long  a longer way than, you know  I mean, both  both strategies work.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"But, yeah, thanks for the feedback on the environmental justice and  and climate equity as well, you know, that's",0,B3,07/26/2023
"the same kind of concept, too right? In the  in the 2100, in the sea level rise, the demand goes down because they've gotta move away from the coast. It's gonna be all flooded, right? That's the same thing that's gonna happen in PUC is that when  with six feet of sea level rise, the water demand goes down. I don't know where they're gonna go, but they cannot stay there, right? So, you know, that's some of the things we're tossing around. What is the  what is a viable scenario to apply? But that kind of thing, they're gonna be really impacted in East Honolulu because all those rich homes on the coast, especially in Kuliʻouʻou and that area, that's really the hot spot of the  of the sea level rise, so  but those are, you know, 80 years, 50 to 80 years away.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Okay, thank you very much. Any  any other questions, Commissioners? Is there anybody in the boardroom or on the public that has a question for Barry or Abbey?",0,B3,07/26/2023
"One last thing, the 170 gallons per capita, you're taking the total use and dividing it by the population?",0,B3,07/26/2023
And those are really like apples and oranges. If you're talking about,0,B3,07/26/2023
"the big users, and thenyou're talking about North Shore being really high, but there are very few people on the North Shore.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"So I think you need a better comparison. It's very deceptive, and I think  I think it's making East Honolulu look really bad when it's probably not the household users that are doing that.",0,B3,07/26/2023
I can see your points.,0,B3,07/26/2023
"Yes, go ahead, Kaleo.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Ayron Strauch, a member of the public. (Laughter.)",0,B3,07/26/2023
"I just want to point out the  the issues with using an average is very misleading, as it's being pointed out. There are a lot of densely populated parts of East Honolulu  and I know because I live out there  that don't use much water for irrigating landscaping, and they don't own a pool. There are a few neighborhoods that are very less  is much less dense. I mean, homes on 30,000 square feet or more, and they have lavish landscaping, and they dohave swimming pools. And I'm happy to hear that there's a potentially, a new rate structure because there are neighbors of mine that are using 500 gallons per day or per person per day or more. And I think my house is down at 94; I just calculated it out, so I'm very happy about that. But the average doesn't necessarily tell the whole story. So, yes, thank you.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Yeah. We have an inverted block rate for residential because there's an essential needs tier that's the lowest rate, and the higher  the more water you use, the higher the rate gets, so, you know, it's gonna get even higher with the  if they adopt the rates. The non-residential rate, though, is flat because of the big diversity in commercial and nonresidential uses, but they'll definitely feel it. You know, it's over $5. When I started, it was $1.77 per thousand; now it's like 5, 5.20. So, you know, it's just trying to  everything  all the costs are going up. And we realize that, you know, folks are being squeezed, too, at the grocery store and all of that, inflation and stuff, but anyway, those are the dynamics at work here. I think, though, they work towards more efficiency, you know, and the extent that we can help with our incentive program, it's called Water Sensible, you know, we can help to quicken that pace, so",0,B3,07/26/2023
"By the way, I want to offer my four rain barrels in Kahalu'u to anybody in East O'ahu since it's always overflowing, and we don't need them.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Take him up on it, Barry. Take him up on it. Okay.",0,B3,07/26/2023
I have one last  sorry.,0,B3,07/26/2023
"As a renter, I would be really interested in understanding how the board considers renters who don't see a water bill, who may not be incentivized to conserve, and so if  and given the  like I don't know what the population that rents is, you know, like making sure that that kind of maybe is more directly communicated versus via jacking up rents. You know, that people can be engaged and aware. All of my students if I ask them how many of them pay a water bill, none of them raise their hands. So, you know, just really connecting to the population that rents that doesn't  that doesn't understand the (inaudible).",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Yeah, it's an ongoing challenge. It's the hard-to-reach customers that are renters that don't see the bill.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"(Inaudible.) We're ramping up social media and all of that and trying to hit  you know, get to them, but it's challenging.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Chair, can I  can I just add something real quick?",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Maybe for the commission to consider and then the board. So thanks for the presentation, Barry; it's always good to see how the board is kind of taking the lead on this ahupua'a model and the behaviors and values that go with it. But kind of similar to what Chair said, they kind of of totally don't exist in this East Honolulu Watershed Plan. There's just conflict between the value set of sustainable, self-sustaining communities when you see this massive transfer of water from outside their community into a community and then the high use. But just maybe something to consider, you know, as a  we are in a water management area, right, and the commission does  while we issue water use permits to the board as a  as a permittee, you  it is a tool that this commission has. And I'm curious from the board's perspective on strategies of managing and encouraging or even regulating conservation, whether or not that was considered in your planning process or something that you would recommend even the commission get involved. While the code says that we delegate to the board or the board  Department of WateSupply to manage their end uses if there's complications in seeing conservation, as kind of Chair mentioned, from those end users, is something that the commission should be considering in terms of its review of your water use permit to the board and/or those end users that are benefiting from that allocation? Just, you know, that's a policy or a strategy or a tool that I'm curious you've  whether you've considered. It obviously would put a potential restriction on you as the holder of the permit, but if there isn't an incentive or disincentive to change behavior, is that something that should be considered by this body?",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Thank you for your comment, Kaleo. Maybe we can start with a presentation one day, informational, on our conservation program and all the different facets. You know, you're talking about certain tactics and incentives on how to do that. You know, we've been expanding it as much as we can. Maybe we can just start there and then maybe the  you know, there are gaps that you see or not fast enough or something, and we can kind of, you know, react to it or address that. I think we're doing quite a bit, but it's a matter of focus so that we focus on the high  high-water users and, you know, we can  you know, if the commission is also saying that they support and are, you know, expecting, you know, greater efficiency, that may  I don't know if that would move the needle, but at least start with where we're at now and where we think we're gonna go and  and if you folks are willing, we'd be happy to make a presentation.",0,B3,07/26/2023
"Yeah. No, I think that's good. I think it's also just you come up with long-term strategies as part of this plan, right? And as a planner, 2100 may seem a long time away, but it's  it is far to see that reduction from 170 to 130 as a catalyst project. But in the interim, are there other strategies, tools that maybe this body can support the board in its implementation towards conservation effort, right? So, you know, we can have  and we probably should have that dialogue before this body so that we can understand what you're currently doing, what the ultimate goal is, and if there are additional tools that we can employ or support you with as the regulator, right, as the trustee of water here in this state. So thank you, thanks for the presentation.",0,B3,07/26/2023

"thank the presenters for their excellent presentation and I note four fundamental commitments: to mitigate or remediate the contamination that’s in that aquifer, to defuel the tanks to eliminate future risks, to develop a community-accepted plan for repurposing the tanks, and to take care of the affected citizens. I have concerns about how long the system will be offline and I’m pleased to see a comprehensive plan for dealing with it. If I read this correctly, the tanks will be defueled by June 2024? is asking if there is an end date for the remediation of the contamination and if you are working towards a specific date for when the water systems can be brought back online for drinking? I acknowledge that things can change and it’s important to have a plan and variance reporting, but I’m seeking a better understanding of the timeline for remediation.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"there is currently no clear timeline for the environmental remediation of the Red Hill facility, as a comprehensive site assessment and defueling of tanks are needed to identify contamination not only from the events that happened in November of 2021 but also look for anypotential contamination from other things that have happened at Red Hill over the last 80 years. There is the pursuit of a water treatment plant for the Red Hill shaft, but regulatory approval is required before it can be approved as a drinking water source. The temporary project for this is set for 2025, and the permanent project for 2027, after the tanks are defueled. The Navy Aiea Halawa shaft is being pursued on an emergency basis and treatment options are being explored as a contingency measure for the community’s protection.",0,C2,04/18/2023
what I take from that is that this system which supplies 25 percent of drinking water for O‘ahu will be offline at least until 2027?,0,C2,04/18/2023
there is potential in 2025 to have a temporary system stood up in place while the long-term system is being built but that is dependent on regulatory approval.,0,C2,04/18/2023
"so, the tank repurposing, that decision would be made next month with the DOH’s approval? Did I read that correctly?",0,C2,04/18/2023
"a decision-making process with the Department of Health (DOH) and regulators, potentially related to supplement number two. Currently, we are following option one but are open to changing to another methodology if necessary. I want to emphasize the importance of submitting all relevant information to DOH to make an informed decision in partnership with their team. We do not want to speak for DOH but believe that it is important to keep the momentum going and support moving into other options if necessary.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"It is important to create a plan for remediation and defueling once a decision has been made about which option to pursue in order to move towards closure on the issue. There is the need for a clear goal and tracking progress towards targeted outcomes and appreciates that progress is being made in this direction. However, I note that this plan addresses only one-third of the overall issue, which includes determining how long the O‘ahu-based system will be offline. It is also important to consider the pressures on other parts of the system that are meeting the demand that was once met by this part, and whether they are meeting existing allocations and future demand sustainability. Additionally, the need to develop new sources that don’t rely on the offline aquifer.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"we are working on understanding the whole system and aquifers as a whole, and managing everyone’s uses, including the Navy, is important from a regulatory standpoint. Data is important and I encourage others to support the commission’s regulatory role by providing timely and accurate data. There may be other priorities to consider but the ones mentioned are in alignment.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"we want to stay on top of any plans to open up sources in emergency situations and are actively monitoring data to understand potential environmental impacts. I agree with Kaleo that reporting is important, and actively monitoring the data that comes from reporting is the second component of our efforts.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"We are trying to work more closely with the Board of Water Supply to have a collaborative engagement with them, which will help make better decisions with good data. There are some bills in the process through the legislature that may give us additional tools to manage and regulate the system better. The governor’s office is looking at this comprehensively, and the Navy has to partner with them to help make better decisions through good data.",0,C2,04/18/2023
how often can we track or anticipate tracking the progress against the milestones?,0,C2,04/18/2023
"I suggest that the Navy may not have to come to CWRM on a monthly basis but instead provide written updates. The purpose of creating a platform was to get good information and provide the Navy with an opportunity to give accurate, current information. I suggest that they provide the commission with more regular updates, which may not necessarily be in-person presentations but could be written.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"they should come before the commission at least quarterly to have a report unless there's a significant variance, in which case they should report to the commission whenever it occurs.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"to address the Commissioners’ concerns, we can forward the schedule for Navy outreach meetings, which can provide opportunities for the community engagement and updates on remediation and closure efforts. This way, the Navy doesn’t have to directly address these issues to the Commission during their meetings, and the Commissioners can receive more regular updates. However, the commission may need to request updates on allocations and other matters they are responsible for as necessary.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"I am in agreement with Commissioner Hannahs regarding the usefulness of the synoptic view of plans, particularly because the written plans can be difficult to understand. I suggest that it would be helpful to have alternating presentations from the Navy or organizations represented in the group and the groundwater staff to understand and have a more informed view of the aquifer sector areas such as Waimalu, Moanalua, or Pearl Harbor. I also suggest that the public meetings be shared on the commission’s Red Hill page so that the public can access them. Can I get clarification on some terms used in the Navy’s infographics, particularly in the Gantt chart. There were three or four words that were repeated – dewatering, repacking, and unforeseen repairs, and maintenance before defueling.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"Dewatering is removing built-up condensation from the tanks to prevent corrosion and repacking is the process of reintroducing fuel into the lines to stabilize the equilibrium before defueling. Unforeseen repairs and maintenance is a window of time set aside to ensure that all conditions are set for repairs and response drills and training to ensure that all personnel are certified and ready to go. The tank bottom procedure review involves draining the remaining fuel from the main tanks, which is not at the pipe that drains into the main line. The overall process involves a series of iterations that use the same safety. We can simplify the information in the Gantt chart and provide further updates as we drill down with regulators.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"it does help, and it is my understanding that there’s tremendous pressure from these tall tanks, which is part of the safety issues, and that moving fuel is risky business.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"The repairs being done are to ensure the integrity of the system for defueling, and they are being done deliberately and with the help of regulators and third-party quality validation. The dewatering process is also being used to check and ensure the response plan is in place for safe operations. The team is moving fast but also prioritizing safety.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"there have been concerns about the possibility of a change in the defueling plan due to national security during the window of unforeseen repair and maintenance Colonel Williams, do you have any comments on that. She also appreciated the explanation of technical terms and believes it helps establish better transparency and dialogue. However, there is still significant concern about the lengthy timeline and the possibility that the plans may change.",0,C2,04/18/2023
we are committed to the Secretary of Defense’s decision on March 7th to defuel and permanently close the Red Hill facility and that that is the only decision that is out there and that is what we are moving toward every single day.,0,C2,04/18/2023
"I had one more question for NAVFAC, Sarah Moody, as I was a bit confused about that diagram. I see a lot of monitoring and investigation and also remediation and actual remediation. Why is it called remediation when it’s more monitoring? I was frustrated because there isn’t even a discussion of what you are going to do besides measure.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"we are actively working on remediation efforts at the site of the spill that occurred in November 2021 at Red Hill. We have already excavated contaminated soil, are using vapor monitoring ports to remove any remaining fuel and are skimming and removing fuel from the aquifer. There is a need for a larger, holistic approach to environmental care and remediation at the entire facility, beyond just the specific site of the spill. The remediation efforts will continue until everyone agrees that they have been successful and that monitoring, and remediation activities are occurring concurrently.",0,C2,04/18/2023
can you confirm that there's still free product coming into the shaft as mentioned? It’s about a tablespoon per month?,0,C2,04/18/2023
"yes. So usually, we only see a sheen of free product after a large rain event and when we do, we're able to collect it with the skimmers and the booms in the shaft and it's an average of a teaspoon to a tablespoon a month right now.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"what do we know about transport of safe dissolved contaminants beyond the Navy Sentinel Wells and immediate proximity, including the additional nine? As someone smart told me the horse is out of barn. (Meaning that the contaminants have already been released, and so the question is what is known about the situation?)",0,C2,04/18/2023
"The original goal of adding 22 monitoring wells was to create a plume delineation to identify where contamination had moved and to monitor if any contamination had moved, then to put them on the outskirts of Red Hill, to be able to either tell us if there had been a large transfer or indicate if any contamination was moving to those locations. The results that they are getting from those P Wells or plume delineation wells show that they don't have a lot of contamination outside of the immediate area of Red Hill. Their heat maps are showing that it's contracted down to the area directly below the tanks from the historical spill since 2014 and then right around the Red Hill shaft where they continue to do operations. The purpose of monitoring wells is to gather weekly data to give definitive answers on any transport of contamination and to look at it from a comprehensive standpoint, including any byproducts of the breakdown of fuel. So, they are looking at it from a comprehensive standpoint of not just current free-flowing fuel but if there are any byproducts of the breakdown of fuel. That's also the efforts of the modeling of what they're trying to do is to be able to create a model to identify where any contaminant may go if an event were to occur or predict potentially where any contaminants went from the events that occurred in 2021.",0,C2,04/18/2023
There was a February 2022 heat map that looked like there was a plume that quickly dissipated. Is there a current interpretation on your end? Was it just advected away or was that natural attenuation?

"a lot of it was removed directly from the Red Hill shaft. The continuous pumping of the gas allowed them to get free product off the top of the shaft and allowed them to remove as much as possible. I think there is a level of natural attenuation and that if you speak with experts, they will say that's occurring as well as what's happening in the strata. We do hope to eventually pursue studies that will give them more definitive information on natural attenuation.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"there is data related to monitoring wells and TPH hits and spikes. The presence of TPH doesn’t necessarily indicate a large amount of contamination. The current data shows fewer TPH hits than during the most extreme scenario. The goal is to recover every last drop of fuel, and the science behind defining natural attenuation and modeling transport. Partnerships are important and positive progress to make risk-based decisions. The end date for the project will depend on permitting, transparency, and belief and the focus will be on closing the site permanently before beginning broader remediation. Working on both remediation and closure simultaneously poses some challenges.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"The Navy does not have a good track record in Hawai‘i of stewardship like Kaho‘olawe, M kua, and that have UXO that still cannot be restored. There's this recommendation or option one by the Navy as the least impactful environmental option because there won't be trucks. It’s sort of in Congress with the reality that many people still can’t do ecological restoration in certain areas because of UXO or because of contamination. So, what may be fast for the Navy to close the books on leaves a long legacy for Hawai‘i and residents. I want to challenge you to think about what's best in the short term and then there's what may make sense for the rest of us in the long term. We are here for generations and beyond so please consider that DOH recommendation.",0,C2,04/18/2023
"for start, reducing the amount of non-potable water being put in H lawa stream. Also, the long-term remediation is being considered, including the establishment of appropriate monitor wells outside of Red Hill are critical. There are legal issues with monitoring wells on private land, but it is critical to put them in to deal with the contamination and spread of the plume, something that both DOH and DLNR can work with the private landowners. The Navy has offered resources and they’re willing to put the wells in, but until they are in place, it will be difficult to establish the type of science needed to understand how we can open the aquifer again. From a planning perspective it may take one to three years to have that type of science that they feel capable of opening the aquifer again. Finally, to remind the Navy that the Water Commission is not an official regulator, but they have broad regulatory authority with permits and permit modifications. The Navy’s request for emergency use didn’t go to the Water Commission, but there’s a lot of issues on the aquifer besides the Navy’s use of it. Over pumping, even in the short term, could affect other issues that the Navy may not be aware of. The presentation provided by the Navy has been positive and productive, and it is appreciated.",0,C2,04/18/2023

There are a lot of improvements, enhancements, and measuring devices that will be installed within the next two years. What would that organization look like and how would that organization be able to capture and maintain institutional knowledge, which was an issue faced in the Red Hill problem. Is there a better use for the water instead of putting it into the stream if the Navy continues to pump three million gallons a day or 1.8 billion gallons a day.

The operations of the water system will remain with the Joint Base staff and the water teams, and they will continue to support and maintain institutional knowledge by creating collaborative efforts amongst their team.

The failure in Red Hill was a fuel systems issue that led to fuel being released into a wellhead that got into a system. The Water systems operators have been working for the joint based public works department for up to 40 years and are essential to the local community. What they are looking at in terms of transition for informational purposes is that the Department of Defense and United States Navy are working together to manage fuel across all locations globally so that they are protecting the environment and communities and operating smartly. As the Joint Task Force completes its mission, there may be a transition back to Navy ownership, but it will not affect how operations are managed and permitted.

In the future in 2024 and 2025, we are looking for opportunities to increase staff to make certain that they don’t fail in their inability to monitor, and we are seeking support from Congress members and Senators to aid in this growth.

"we just have this juxtaposed against Dr. Longman’s presentation which was practical and useful. My last point is more of a comment and its sort of the line of Aurora’s comments. Kathy Ho and I we were very privileged to be part of Kaho‘olawe, during the transfer and I remember the Commissioners. I was with the Deputy Attorney General's office and advising the Kaho‘olawe Island Reserve Commission and I do remember Auntie Frenchie, Emmett, many of the Commissioners asking, “Dawn should we take the island back?” And I said, “As your lawyer, no. You're not going to have enough money and you're not going to have enough time. But as a Hawaiian, of course you have to take it because we will never get it back under any other circumstance.” General Hashimoto and it is publicly rhetorical. I know the Secretary of Defense has made a commitment to close and remove. But I want you to think about, will there become a point in time when U.S. DOD says we've put as much technology and money as we can, and this is as good as it's going to get. And it may not be good enough. But again, this is totally above our pay grade with that answer. I don't know what that is we're still struggling with Kaho‘olawe; no surface clearance, no subsurface clearance, people can't even you know it's not habitable. But we took it back because that's as good as it's going to get. So, I know looming against all of this is that ultimate. What are we eventually going to get back? This is so much more critical from a public health and safety perspective. But again, just bear in mind that is sort of for some of us the elephant in the room. At some point in time will the Department of Defense may say we've done all that we can. No, don't need to answer.",0,C2,04/18/2023

Also expresses concern about the Aiea Halawa shaft being put back online and how it could affect the spread of fuel and other contaminants to the lo‘i kalo and streams in the area. She raised concerns about the repurposing of tanks for non-fuel use and the lack of conversation around foreclosure and decommissioning.

There is a need for an accounting of what toxins should be considered. There is a need for what toxins have been brought into Hawai‘i and what is missing in the aquifer.

"Thank you very much, Dean. I'd just like to add to that, if you recall several months ago staff did a briefing to the Water Commission on the Maui temp housing to support the displaced residents of Maui, the fire displaced residents. We did share with you that if the water was coming from the County of Maui, under the Code, we would permit that to be an existing use if Maui County Water Department was servicing the Maui temp housing. However, this is a different circumstance and this circumstance we have a private water purveyor but also providing support to Maui temp housing, specifically for their employees. Rather than seek a suspension from Executive Emergency Proclamation suspending 174C to account for these unique situations, under the Code we have the authority to request a declaratory ruling by the Commission that a permit is not required given these unique circumstances. Given this situation, we chose to come to the Water Commission to seek a declaratory ruling that it's not that we wouldn't enforce, but we would not require a permit for this Maui temp housing, given that there is sufficient water in this aquifer and it is for Maui temp housing. Anything beyond that would require a water use permit and they've completed all the processes. We are continuing to move forward on the water designation process, but given the timing, of the necessity to build that these are clearly temporary housing units and that they are being put on the Kapalua Golf Course, I think CWRM felt that this unique circumstances that the appropriate mechanism was to bring this back as a dec(laratory) action to the Water Commission. That provides some additional background. We did receive written testimony, normally we take questions by the Commissioners before we take public testimony. Commissioner Aurora Kagawa-Viviani is not here, but she did have some questions. I'm going to read them into the record and permit staff an opportunity to address them. There’s no objections? The first comment relates to system source - assuming my interpretation is correct and I'm trying to read this verbatim from her email – “please clarify what the potable Kapalua public water system managed by Hawaii Water Service formally by MLP’s Kapalua Water Company is served solely by two wells, Kapalua 1 and 2, while Kapalua area non-potable needs are supported by Honokōhau Stream and Honolua Ditch. They are different systems. Note...”",1,B2,07/23/2024
"Yes, that is correct. The potable system is served by the two wells. Kapalua 1 and 2, and the region's non-potable needs are serviced by the Honokōhau Stream and actually the Honokōhau Ditch. Yes, there are two - the groundwater and surface water systems are two separate systems.",1,B2,07/23/2024

"She didn't give me follow-up questions, so I'm just going to read her question. “Third, actions upon expirations seem internally inconsistent. Existing language suggests water use permit will be required to extend use past 2031; however, ambiguity is introduced in recommendation two with the indication that the ruling may be extended or modified in addition to a permit application for new use. Given the permit process will be ongoing, is it possible to provide more clarity about the steps HWS should pursue?”",1,B2,07/23/2024
"That's probably my fault for not catching that in recommendation one. We did say that we will not require Hawaiʻi Water Service to obtain a water use permit until the year 2031 but wanting to provide some flexibility for the Commission at that time. I added in recommendation two that would give you folks options to, again, either extend this declaratory ruling, modify the ruling, or require Hawaiʻi Water Service or TY Management to file for a water use permit for new use or some other action you deem appropriate, either now or at that time.",1,B2,07/23/2024

"Just a quick question, you mentioned that the Kapalua water system is in effect a dual system for public purpose – one, for potable from the wells 1 and 2 and then it uses surface water as well and all homes served by the public utility have in effect two meters. Will these units have that second availability of non- potable water, surface water to them? Secondly, if not, does it make much sense to perhaps expand the permit from 400 to the usual 600 gallons per day because these are one, two, three, and four bedroom units. They might reach a situation in some of the larger units where they could use and should need more than 400 gallons per day. Just a question.",1,B2,07/23/2024

My name is Robert Strand, I'm an attorney representing TY Management Corporation and with me this morning is Onaona Thoene who's also representing TY Management Corporation in connection with the water in the Kapalua Village Project with the 50 homes for the displaced residents. There was one question, if I may address the first question, it is the intention of TY Management to remove the modular units after seven years. Again, if it turns out that the rebuilding of Lahaina takes longer, we would have to come back before the Commission and a lot of other both governmental and private entities and seek permission to extend that, but right now the intention is to remove them after seven years. As far as Mr. Meyer's question, there is not going to be a second meter for non-potable water. We don't anticipate there will be any need for substantial irrigation at the site and what the project is trying to do is to use as little water as is reasonably required. Commissioner Meyer is correct, there are two bedroom, three bedroom, and four bedroom homes, but we think with the check meters and the low flow appliances or I'm sorry, I should say...",1,B2,07/23/2024

"This land used to be part of what they call the Kapalua Village Course which has been out of operation for quite some time. They have the Plantation Course mauka and the Bay Course makai and in both of those courses they've implemented conservation measures for the irrigation water. At one time they used this property to grow sod and they were irrigating the sod and they would use it on the other golf courses, but obviously now that they're using it for housing there won't be any need for that irrigation water per se. They won't be growing sod on the, I think it's the first hole of the Kapalua Village Course, so there won't be any impact on the surface water that's being used for the golf courses.",1,B2,07/23/2024

The next priority would be given to employees within the resort, could be the hotels or the other commercial properties there, and if there's still units remaining, they would be open to any displaced residents of Lahaina who needed temporary housing.

"Aloha, for the record my name is Elena Bryant testifying on behalf of Earthjustice. We want to emphasize that we absolutely support the immediate construction of temporary emergency housing for displaced Maui Komohana community members and commend TY Management Corporation for self-funding these housing units and supporting its community members in this way. Here, it appears based on the submittal and presentation that the requested use of 20,000 gpd (gallons per day) for 50 temporary modular housing units can be accommodated under the sustainable yield in light of other requested existing and new uses with little to no impact on the aquifer. But, we have concerns about setting a precedent of exempting uses from water use permitting requirements in designated water management areas without express and explicit terms governing that exempted use and we have questions and concerns similar to what Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani has raised. We urge the Commission to add language to the ruling, making it abundantly clear that this use is being exempted from water use permitting requirements under the unique and extenuating circumstances involved here. We would urge the Commission to also include language in its ruling, making it clear that the requested use shall only be used for temporary housing of displaced Maui Komohana community members, that approval of this use will cease if and when the temporary housing units are no longer being used to support community members, and that the 20,000 gpd cannot be used for or converted to any other purpose without going through the water use permitting process and of course any other sunsetting provision clarifications that would aid future Commissioners and the public in understanding the terms of this use. Thank you.",1,B2,07/23/2024
Thank you very much.,1,B2,07/23/2024
"I'd just like to speak to this, we're having a crisis in trying to create some units for people to go because they have to move out of hotels. I greatly respect the process that the Commission follows to make sure all the t's are crossed and i’s are dotted, but in this case this is an area that is one of the few aquifers that is not being over pumped, where the wells have had very, very stable chlorides. I wrote a history of Maui’s water back in 2004 and suggested in that that the County should take over these wells because they appear to be unpolluted and have low chlorides. That being said, I think it's a good idea to look for opportunities where water can be provided to affordable units that are going to be kept affordable either temporary time to cover the need or longer term. There is another project I noticed in the presentation that was made to the department in June or made by CWRM in June that there was a map showing projects that were considered ready to go. One of these is Pūlelehua which I also and many others have tracked for years. This is a promised development that's supposed to deliver affordable housing, the housing is going to be affordable for 30 years which most housing in our County is not. Many people have been counting on this project for years and years but they too have no source of water except from Maui Land and Pine who pledged that they could use water either from Honokōhau, which now seems less probable because that water is really overcommitted or from some other Maui Land and Pine source which would be the Kapalua wells. Their need is 75,000 gallons, so I think that it is good to look at the big picture, but in Honolua aquifer if there are a few exceptions that could help get people in housing. This would help 50 people. Pūlelehua, first phase, would help I think 140 people. These are rentals so people don't have to wait in line to buy houses, they can just have a place, a roof over their head at an affordable rate. I just urge you to also be practical as well as upholding your public trust responsibilities and I am preparing a letter on behalf of Maui Tomorrow to go into more detail on this and it'll be submitted in the next few days. This is a difficult decision, but I think that we have people hurting out there in West Maui who are being forced out of the hotels and who really want a roof over their heads and they do need some water. Thank you.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"Thank you very much, Lucienne. Anyone else? I will share with you that as Chair of the Water Commission, working with CWRM staff and the Attorney General's office, we have struggled with how do we address Maui temp housing, how do we address the Maui housing crisis, and trying to very narrowly tailor where it does not fall on the Emergency Proclamation because we did not want to seek a suspension of 174C, but utilizing the existing code. We felt comfortable under 174C-48 that the County can redistribute and not be a new use, but as we're going through the water use management process, having to be very cautious about being transparent, fair, and objective, but also recognizing the unique circumstances of the displaced Maui residence. I think based upon those circumstances, we felt that the declaratory action was an appropriate action in this case as it permitted the Commission to take action in the context of a public meeting and so that we could do this in open. Again, we are trying to very narrowly tailor it - be on a case-by-case basis. As I think both Commissioner Miike and I have said, this is the first time I've seen us use a declaratory ruling and although as broad as it is, we are trying to be very cautious about how we implement the Water Code in light of these circumstances.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"Just dealing with the comments from the Earthjustice attorney, it seems like the submittal has everything in there except a more formal statement about the housing to be used only for displaced people from the fire. I think that it already said that, maybe we can incorporate that into the recommendation. You wouldn't have any problem with that?",1,B2,07/23/2024
"No, that's certainly the intent and in the priorities we mentioned, we're going to fill them all with displaced West Maui residents.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"I know Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani did provide - I don't know how different - she just says she would modify the recommendations: 1) “The Commission on Water Resource Management will not require Hawaii Water Service Company, Inc. to obtain a water use permit under 174C-48a for the delivery of up to 20,000 gallons a day of groundwater to its customer TY Management Corporation, TMK for 50 temporary modular housing units of the Kapalua Village Temporary Housing Project for Kapalua employees who have been displaced by the Lahaina fire until the year 2031.” That's what it says. Okay, I don't...",1,B2,07/23/2024
"Her point is that just a little bit of inconsistency between, we're saying that if you read Recommendation 1, it appears that they would need to obtain a water use permit after 2031. Recommendation 2 gives you folks options to either extend the ruling, modify it, or require filing of water use permit application for new use.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"She's recommending, “may include an extension of the ruling, modification...required filing of a water use permit application for new use or other action as determined by the Commission."" She was just bringing out the inconsistency? Do you have a recommendation?",1,B2,07/23/2024
"I agree with her recommendation of first setting an expiration or sunset date, defining that whether you want to go with seven years from today or end of 2031. That may be the first step.",1,B2,07/23/2024
Is there a preference?,1,B2,07/23/2024
"Well, I suppose we'd like December 31, 2031.",1,B2,07/23/2024
What’s a few months?,1,B2,07/23/2024
"There’s just so much uncertainty as to how quickly Lahaina is going to rebuild and I did see in the newspaper last week that there’s at least one house that had a permit. That fella is rebuilding, but it's going to be a very slow process.",1,B2,07/23/2024
Are we adding or keeping that about we still have the option of extending it?,1,B2,07/23/2024
"I think that's on recommendation number two, right?",1,B2,07/23/2024
Are you making any changes?,1,B2,07/23/2024
"I support this water use, but I guess the question in Recommendation 2, the last sentence is that is there a potential of this morphing into permanent housing? I would expect that we would have the ability if the need for temporary housing extends beyond the estimated seven years, that it'll be okay. The issue would be really is that if this morphs into permanent housing. It's like having temporary buildings on the university campus. There's nothing more permanent than a temporary building.",1,B2,07/23/2024
If we need to clarify that...we should probably be having a motion then discussion. The representation has been only for temp housing.,1,B2,07/23/2024
Are you ready for a motion?,1,B2,07/23/2024
"Yeah, I think we should procedurally have a motion and then have discussion and then we can do the amendments. Go ahead.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"I make a motion to take the staff’s recommendation 1 with the amendment that the temporary modular housing for the Kapalua Village Temporary Housing Project not be limited to the golf course employees, but to the displaced residents of Lahaina as a result of the Lahaina fires and this temporary modular housing will cease on December 31, 2031.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"And then Condition 2, are you making any changes?",1,B2,07/23/2024
"Chair, can we be more specific on the last sentence on the options for continued use of water where it says that “for new uses”.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"Okay, how would you like to?",1,B2,07/23/2024
"I'm not sure on what pathways forward that if the applicant applies for a new water permit, would that now become permanent zoning or permanent housing? My understanding is any permanent use is going to require new water use permit.",1,B2,07/23/2024
I mean this is only because it's temporary and that the intention is that they will get offline.,1,B2,07/23/2024
"Should that action be independent of this approval? In other words, do we need to narrow this extended use only for emergency use for temporary housing? That could go on for years beyond the seven years.",1,B2,07/23/2024
I think that goes to Elena’s comment about making it a little more clear that...,1,B2,07/23/2024
"I agree with that. I would support that, Elena's comment.",1,B2,07/23/2024
Can I have a comment on Kathy's motion? It sort of leaves it open that anybody could apply for displaced and their priority is their employees. Then if there's extra...,1,B2,07/23/2024
"I guess we should prioritize it with golf course employees, then hotel employees...",1,B2,07/23/2024
"Other resort employees, it could be commercial properties and then if there's still units left over, they will provide them to other displaced residents in West Maui. That would be the three levels of priority.",1,B2,07/23/2024
I would incorporate those three priorities.,1,B2,07/23/2024
"If I may, I can put up a Word document and we can edit that?",1,B2,07/23/2024
"“Options for continued use are limited only for Maui temp housing, but may include an extension.” Is that the language that we're looking at for number 2? So, there are three priorities in number 1 – 1) displaced golf course employees, 2) displaced hotel resort employees, and 3) fire displaced Maui residents.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"I think that language is, I don't know, the only thing I prioritized for 1) Kapalua employees, 2) other Kapalua employee residents, and 3) West Maui residents who have been displaced.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"I think that's the intention and I think the language that Dean came up with works with those changes, works.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"“And for fire displaced West Maui residents,” because we don't have fire...",1,B2,07/23/2024
"It says, “who have been displaced by the Lahaina fire.”",1,B2,07/23/2024
"Sorry, you guys are one sentence ahead of me.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"Move the last, the date?",1,B2,07/23/2024
"And we're going to move it to December 31, 2031. Then number 2, if we could where it says, “Options for continued use of water shall be limited to temporary housing and may include an extension of this ruling,” so that we do include that limitation, “it should only be used,” “but shall be limited to temporary housing for displaced Maui residents and may include...” Is that satisfactory? Applicant seems to be okay. Commissioners? Paul and Wayne?",1,B2,07/23/2024
"I’m okay, thank you.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"Can I clarify? Sorry, it says “shall notify,” so we're okay with them just writing us a letter notifying us of the change?",1,B2,07/23/2024
I think we would have to notify you and then get another approval.,1,B2,07/23/2024
"I would think that's the case, but I want to be clear that that's what we're intending.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"And we have other approvals we need get from the County and from the Kapalua Resort Association and other entities and hopefully, we’ll know well in advance if we'll be able to.",1,B2,07/23/2024
"It says, “may include an extension of this ruling...modification of this ruling,” so it...",1,B2,07/23/2024
Where do you see “shall notify”?,1,B2,07/23/2024
"It says right there, “shall notify.” They'll notify us and then further down it says, “may include an extension modification of this ruling, required filing...”",1,B2,07/23/2024
One requires them to notify us and then it requires a ruling by the Commission.,1,B2,07/23/2024
We have one more from Earthjustice.,1,B2,07/23/2024
Just commenting on what you guys said just now.,1,B2,07/23/2024
You guys have already received their testimony.,1,B2,07/23/2024

"I was just wondering project proponents, BWS, did you guys talk to John Reppun or Rick Towill or KEY Project? They’ve been very active here; this is where I grew up, so I know Waiheʻe Stream and I know that they like to be informed. I think this is probably advantageous, but did you consult with them by chance? MATTHEW MURAYAMA, HONOLULU BOARD OF WATER SUPPLY (HBWS): Sorry, can you repeat that?",1,B5,01/30/2024
"Did you consult with either John Reppun, Rick Towill, or KEY Project? They’ve been very actively involved with BWS.",1,B5,01/30/2024
I don’t think so.,1,B5,01/30/2024
"I would urge you to put a call out to them, ask Barry Usagawa to give them a call so they know what’s happening up there.",1,B5,01/30/2024
I would just echo that. That was a section of the application I also honed in on was traditional and customer practices and I know that there’s kalo farming in the area. Similar to with my comments on B4 when construction is occurring that there be communication with the downstream users because they will probably observe changes to maybe quality or flow or would be aware of the activities.,1,B5,01/30/2024

"PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Ryan Imata, Ground Water Regulation Branch Chief; Gregory Barbour & Dr. Alex Leonard, Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA) Staff gave an informational briefing on the status of the Ota Well.",0,C1,03/19/2024
Can you describe the Ota Well? You always talk about the Ota Well but what’s the capacity? Just describe it briefly.,0,C1,03/19/2024
"The Ota Well is a proposed well that’s planned to be drilled in the high level band in the Keauhou region and it’s above the Kaloko Honokohau National Park but Queenie, it’s to the south? I don’t think it’s in the particular ahupuaʻa that was being looked at for the Keauhou designation. Nonetheless, the Commission did require some special conditions attached to the issuance of the permit.",0,C1,03/19/2024
What was the capacity?,0,C1,03/19/2024
"It’s pretty large, yeah Queenie? It’s over 400 gallons per minute.",0,C1,03/19/2024
The purpose was to primarily I think to supply the Kamakana development. It is a mixed-use development.,0,C1,03/19/2024
Maybe explain the applicants.,0,C1,03/19/2024
"Sorry, I know you’re coming at this without too much context. The applicants are Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority and HHFDC (Hawaiʻi Housing Finance & Development Corporation) are the applicants and the well is intended to be dedicated to the Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply at some point. I think that’s it.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Larry, I think HHFDC intended for it to be an affordable, it was a housing project Kamakana Villages in Kona. NELHA was also going to get an allocation of that water for their facility and then the rest, they would eventually dedicate the system to Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply.",0,C1,03/19/2024

"Got it, I should have been more comprehensive in my presentation.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Aloha, my name is Greg Barbour, I’m the executive director at the Natural Energy Lab here in Kailua-Kona. I have with me Dr. Alex Leonard, our project manager and Dean Minakami from HHFDC was here earlier but had to go to the Capitol. He sends his apologies for not being able to stay. I can provide a summary of what we are requesting in our modifications and thank you for making the time for us. Like Ryan said, this informational briefing we wanted to give you an idea of what we’re thinking and trying to get some feedback and have a public forum for discussing our proposal. I do have a map and I will give some more background to the project. I want to start by thanking Chair Chang. Immediately after session she invited Dean, who is the executive director of HHFDC and myself to meet with her and she gave us very good guidance and gave us some direction. She said that if you’re interested in avoiding a contested case hearing, if you’re interested in resolving this and trying to make a request to CWRM board for modification, then the ball is in our court, is what she told us. She said we have to go out and do our homework and she suggested that we go out and talk to all the stakeholders in the area in West Hawaiʻi, on the island of Hawaiʻi and we did that. First of all, we came up with a proposal for modification for the two items that Ryan showed on his slide deck and then we started talking to people. Actually, now it’s been over a hundred people, in the past six months over 30 different organizations. Our discussions included lineal descendants of the area, cultural descendants of the area, as well. Aha Moku, we reached out to the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation and I think they’re here today, and then we talked with a number of government agencies including the Division of Aquatic Resources, the Division of Forestry. We talked with the Department of Health, we talked with DHHL Hawaiian Home Lands, which by the way they’re a partner with us in this project in addition to HHFDC. We talked with the county Planning Department, we talked with the county Housing Department, we talked with the mayor’s office, we talked with the county water supply. We talked with a number of private developers in in West Hawaiʻi, including Liliʻuokalani Trust, we talked with Lanihau Partners, I think we talked with one other developer but the name escapes me. Kamehameha Schools, we talked with them. I think we did our homework, I think we did follow Chair Chang’s advice. I think we have very good, proposed modifications that make much more sense. They clarify what’s being proposed in terms of the conditions and so I’d like to explain those to you right now, if I could share my screen.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Let me just clarify one point, Greg. I do not recall advising you to avoid a contested case, but I did nonetheless advise because both HHFDC and NELHA were not comfortable with the modifications. I did say you do have a permit, if you want those conditions modified, I would encourage you to meet with the community and then come back. After you’ve met with the community and developed a proposed modification of those conditions and we can bring that back to the Water Commission. That’s kind of where we are. Over the year, you’ve done the outreach. Based upon that outreach, you’re going to present to us these proposed modifications. I don’t know who else is on this call, but if there’s any lawyers on this call and if I advise you’re not going to get sued, I probably could get in trouble. Don’t worry, please go ahead with your presentation.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Sorry, Chair for misspeaking, I think you’re correct in [inaudible]. Here’s a map. This is Kailua-Kona town here. This is the Queen Kaʻahumanu Highway here. This is the upper-level road right through here. This is our well site, it is proposed for 1.0 million gallons. This is the Honuaʻula Forest Reserve which is part of condition 1a and this in the blue is the ahupuaʻa for this wellsite and it’s shown here. The proposed use of the water would be one-third for NELHA and that would be 330,000 gallons. One-third would be for HHFDC, Hawaii Housing Finance Development Corporation. They have an affordable housing project probably in this area right here generally just above town and they would get 330. DHHL, we entered into an agreement with them that we would provide them 2.6% of the water, so less than a third for sure, 2.6%. The way it works with the County of Hawaiʻi is that you drill the well, you develop the well, and then you dedicate that well to the County and they keep one-third peak use. We’ll end up with only one-third and HHFDC will end up with one-third. HHFDC, their development at Kamakana Village is stopped because they cannot get water credits, so this well if it was drilled and it was approved for use would provide up to an additional 2,000 affordable housing units in West Hawaiʻi that are badly needed. That’s kind of a summary background of our project. The condition, I believe it’s 1a that Ryan showed, we originally were opposed to that, completely opposed to that because we had no idea where that funding would go. We wanted to be assured that that money would be used to preserve that Honuaʻula Forest Reserve and after numerous discussions with the Division of Forestry, we came to an agreement that that water would be used to build a fence line generally in this area. I say generally but it’s basically straight across here and that that would be to keep the ungulates out of the upper-level area, I believe. They’re really trying to protect this native species in this area and we agreed as long as there’s a specified use for those fundings and we could be assured that that money would be used for that fence line. Then we came to an agreement where we’re not opposing condition 1a anymore. We are saying that in the yellow that these payments would be limited for a period of 30 years and not in perpetuity and then like Ryan said, we had been discussing this with Kaleo between the August approval. We were going to come back for reconsideration in October of 2022 and I’m not exactly sure what happened, why that was not agreed to. The items in red were items that Kaleo had agreed to and it was just really for clarification that that funding would be used for that forest reserve indicated there. That’s a summary of that. Maybe I stop there and ask if there are any questions?",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Thank you for your contributions and your willingness to negotiate some of these terms rather than have us all stuck in a fruitless contested case. The first, I want to applaud all the outreach you did, I mean we thought the work that Kaleo started, that Chair Chang is also supporting of really having the community reach out and talk to each other directly rather than have us be the arbiter of different perspectives, is really the way to go. Seems like you embraced that. I hope that you feel that you have a better understanding of how to align with their values and the expectations of the other stakeholders in this system. I want to applaud that work. The condition 1a ties to a sense of worldview or concept of reciprocity that for the benefit of the use, we have an obligation to contribute to the protection and the enhancement of the source. I think it’s fine to make that direct and so that that contribution you’re making goes right to the source of the Honuaʻula Forest Reserve. That’s terrific and it may be used for fencing or they may have other great uses for that money. I don’t think we’re going to specify to them how to use it, but I think that’s good. What bothers me a little bit is 30 years. I don’t know where 30 years comes from. I understand a business wants to cap its liability, I get that, but to me that should be associated as we originally intended for the life of the well, not in perpetuity for the life of the well. If your well has no use after 20 years, why should you be paying for this for another 10? Likewise, if your well has a useful life of 50 years, why should you not be paying, making a contribution to that source from which you’re drawing benefit for the 20 years beyond the 30 that you’re proposing? I just have an issue with that because I think what we’re trying to do and not just with you but with other users and we’ve talked about this from Maui, where is the contribution of the system users to the system source? I think we’re exploring more ways to create that attachment and I just hope you’d reconsider the original language we had there of tying it to the life of the well.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Thank you for that input, Commissioner. That’s why we’re having this informational briefing today, really get a reading if the Commission feels that we’re headed in the right direction.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"I think in many ways you are, so I appreciate it.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"I want to add to that, Greg. I, too, appreciate that you took it very seriously and took to heart the recommendation of engaging with the community. I want you to know I am trying to work with CWRM on how can we be equitable so that we’re not just charging the last person in, so that there is a system of, how do we assess all well permitees to share in the benefit because we haven’t historically and regularly done that. I do want you to understand that we are looking at this from a holistic department view on how can we be more equitable in sharing the cost of watershed management, sharing the cost of administering, monitoring the program. Again, just appreciate this discussion, your consideration, the fact that you took this very seriously. I want to be very clear, we are not expecting NELHA, HHFDC to bear this burden on your own, we will be looking at all users and having them share in the contributions. As Neil said, reciprocity for this is a shared responsibility for all of us, all users. How do we ensure that that’s equitably distributed?",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Condition 1d, and I want to make a correction that the second to last slide that Ryan had in his slide deck, we made an error. We should have deleted that before we sent it in. Those are amendments to 1d and what we’re saying is the last page that he had is what we’re proposing to replace it with. I can explain that to you in a minute. The idea of 1d is it was very broad. It was hard to understand what the purpose was. It was monitoring the waters offshore from the old airport, which is where my mouse is now, for the two miles down to the Kona Surf Hotel. It was offshore monitoring. After we talked to experts in the field and after we understood that no one is doing nearshore onshore monitoring of the basal lens, so before the water gets to the ocean, there’s absolutely no monitoring in West Hawaiʻi, as far as I know. Maybe down at the park but generally it’s the missing link. If you’re trying to understand our position, if you’re trying to understand the impacts of pulling water out of the basal lens from this well, which by the way is around 1,800 ft, so it’s tapping that basal lens which comes out along the shoreline, what we’re proposing is we would drill two monitoring wells. Those are the dots in yellow here. One is at the old airport on state property, one would be in downtown in Kailua-Kona on state property behind the Queen’s Palace. Talking with lineal descendants, they had indicated that there used to be a spring in that area and that’s state property. Another proposed location that in discussion with the County of Hawaiʻi, they also have a park further down, that magenta dot there, is so we could drill three wells. The idea is that we would be able to monitor the basal lens before it reaches the ocean. That will give you a much better idea of the anthropogenic impacts on the basal lens rather than if you’re sampling offshore. There are a number of other variables and it’s hard to understand causal relationships. Is it global warming, was there a lot of rainfall, climate change condition, rising seawater? Monitoring the offshore water is not going to help understand the impacts of the basal lens because it’s already entered the ocean. That’s our position. We talked to a lot of people, nobody has disagreed with us on that condition and I think it’s an elegant solution that Alex, Dr. Leonard came up with, especially since it’s the missing link. It’ll provide a lot of information and that’s what we’re proposing versus offshore monitoring. The other two sites would be the orange dots and those are two of the anchialine ponds in this area. We currently monitor 120 sites every 90 days. We’ve done that for over 30 years both onshore and offshore. We have 34 monitoring wells here at NELHA and we’re just at the north end of this picture here. We also have four anchialine ponds that we monitor and we do that every 90 days. Our water quality lab staff feels comfortable that we could complete this monitoring and have very credible data. We are an EPA certified lab and I think our people do very good work. It would provide a lot of good baseline information to West Hawaiʻi, to understand what’s going on. One of the bright spots of this proposed modification is that a lot of other people said that this could turn into a regional monitoring program for all of West Hawaiʻi. If we had other monitoring wells along the shoreline, onshore, and these wells, we don’t know how deep they would be, perhaps 35 ft, perhaps 50 ft. That’s something that we can discuss as we move forward. If we had a regional monitoring system along the shoreline of the basal lens, that would be invaluable to a lot of the decision makers in this field. I think it would be very valuable to your agency, as well. I know that when we talked with the Division of Aquatic Resources, they were all in favor and I would say excited about this proposal. They do offshore monitoring. Some of what we were going to do in the original condition would be duplicative, so they were supportive. I’ll stop there, but I think it’s an elegant solution. I think it will provide a lot of very good information to decision makers for the future. I’ll stop there.",0,C1,03/19/2024
I don’t think I was aware of that monitoring framework. What are you measuring and monitoring for every 90 days and then is this reported to an agency? What’s done with the data that you guys have been collecting for years?,0,C1,03/19/2024
"That was part of our original permit conditions when we got a CDUP for our project which began 50 years ago. We submit an annual report every year and we put it online. All of our information is online for everyone to see, basically to understand the impact of what we’re doing here. Is there any impact on the offshore waters? I don’t have the list with me, but I do...how many?",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Dozens of parameters, what we would call Standard Marine Water Quality Parameters, anything from physical characteristics to chemistry such as various nitrogen species, phosphorous species, inorganic solutes, turbidity. It’s a fairly extensive list. Basically, we’re looking for any signature that would indicate contribution of runoff from land into the nearshore marine environment.",0,C1,03/19/2024
Do you have any bioindicators that are part of that suite?,0,C1,03/19/2024
"We have what we call our annual biota survey. We have a number of transects set up offshore, they’re surveyed to do reef fish counts and coral health and growth, coral abundance assessments. We monitor that over time, as well.",0,C1,03/19/2024
And the anchialine ponds have their own different metrics?,0,C1,03/19/2024
"Have their own specific program, yes.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"So, this is adding on new sites into an existing framework?",0,C1,03/19/2024
"That’s the idea, yes absolutely. Let me just say that the details of the proposal for the Lanihau monitoring program are not worked out yet. The language of the original conditions was quite vague, very open-ended. I think the intent was for us to sit down with CWRM and other stakeholders and work out the details later. We intentionally kept it that way in our response now because we’d like to include everybody to make sure that we are answering the questions that people feel are important. From our perspective, this gives us a window on the groundwater as it flows into the ocean. It gives the opportunity to look for man’s impact on that water flow both in terms of quantity and quality. We have the option to look for trace chemicals, petrochemicals, run off from streets and then also very importantly because of the ongoing discussion about the hydrology of this area, it gives us a much better opportunity to look at tracer studies to look at where the water is actually coming from.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"I really appreciated you embracing this challenge and designing a model that was relevant and appropriate for both the community as well as our intention. I know that DAR, they do a lot of offshore monitoring. Rather than being duplicative, what I understand is you found the gaps, where’s the missing data points, and designing this framework and it was in consultation. Alex, I would like you to talk a little bit about your experience doing the outreach because I know you did a lot of it and the benefits that you got. One other point I’d like to make is I know that Keith Okamoto with Hawaiʻi DWS, he too is embracing this regional approach. Hawaiʻi County is looking at identifying inventory, where are all the monitoring wells, and where can they supplement that. I don’t even know if we could have even come up with this model, but I think for me at CWRM and with DLNR, we are looking for good data and this is a good approach to get us that information to look at mauka to makai. I know you did share previously because you did a lot of the outreach and I think I’d like the Commission to get a flavor of the people that you spoke to and some of the discussions and just how you walked away given your community engagement.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Thank you, Chair Chang. Where we really started with this was trying to understand what was at the root of the questions being asked by the community. When Covid hit and we were unable to hold the community meetings that had been proposed for these discussions, Kaleo took it upon himself to go out and reach out to people himself, had these hālāwai meetings with a number of lineal and cultural descendants and in conjunction with ʻAha Moku. They came up with these series of recommendations but mostly it was a question about man’s impact on the environment. They came and it was really Kaleo, I believe, who came up with the idea of the biological monitoring plan that was the original proposal for 1d. That’s something that is easy to point at. The concern is, is the groundwater flowing into the environment impacting resources, fish for example or ʻōpihi, or limu along the shoreline? Very valid questions but it was hard for us to get our hands around what was behind those questions and because we’re missing this piece in the middle. Talking with, for example, Charlie Young who was present in those meetings, he fully embraced this idea because it really got to the heart of the community’s concerns. That’s really what they want, that’s really what people want to know and because they are concerned about the bigger picture, but nobody had yet come up with a way of getting to where they wanted to get to. Talking with neighboring landowners and developers and all of them seemed very keen, very eager to see this happen because they understand that what really is needed here is a regional network. If we’re going to be responsible about our resource conservation and management efforts, we need more information than we have. Overwhelmingly, people were supportive of that concept, applying this elsewhere. I reached out to the people that had been originally consulted by Kaleo, principally it’s the Kanuha family who are lineal descendants of this area and I’ve had a number of conversations with Jerome Kanuha about this and he assures me that he speaks for his family and the ʻohana. He was very supportive of this, he says that this goes to the heart of the community’s concerns and he’s very keen to see particularly the site in downtown Kailua-Kona being evaluated because that was his grandmother’s property at one point in time. He remembers there being a natural spring that emerged at that location, so he again is very supportive. I think that’s about it.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Chair, I join you in commending the effort and the work that you proposed, really adds value. You could have just taken an easy way out or a cheaper way out and so forth but you try to do the right thing to help us all understand. I think that’s commendable. For our written record, I just want to correct something Greg said, that the area is from the old Kona Airport State Recreation Area to Royal Kona Resort. I think you said Kona Surf, it’s to the Royal. It’s not that broad, it’s to the Royal Kona. Yeah, thank you.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Ryan, for my verification the last slide in red, does that replace the entire 1d?",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Yes, I believe that’s what Greg was saying.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"To clarify, they’re going to pay for this.",0,C1,03/19/2024
There are other parts of 1d that if you look at...,0,C1,03/19/2024
"What I did was I basically copied this from NELHA’S letter to us because it was represented that the yellow highlights were their proposed changes, then Kaleo had done the stuff in red. There wasn’t a way to cross out the second to last page and represent that that’s what the applicant was proposing. They are proposing to replace it.",0,C1,03/19/2024
Replace the entire section. That’s helpful.,0,C1,03/19/2024
"At the beginning of that, working with practitioners and ʻohana and DAR and so forth, are we going to lose that language because I think they’ve done that?",0,C1,03/19/2024
That was my question.,0,C1,03/19/2024
That should be retained.,0,C1,03/19/2024
"Okay, that makes sense. See Ryan, on the original one it says working with practitioners and ʻohana, but on the one they took that out. I think you’re right because it more accurately reflects their outreach. When I came on board, Ota Well was this crisis, nothing is going to move forward without Ota Well. If you’ve known me after a year, I’m process but I’m also about staying in our lane and in my view it is the applicant’s responsibility to do the outreach, not the department. I think Kaleo felt it wasn’t happening so he wanted to do it, but I think having the applicant go out there and do this, they were able to fashion something so much more meaningful and so much more relevant given their own expertise, as well.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Greg mentioned that at the end of the day, the well was going to be turned over to DOW (referring to the Department of Water Supply). The applicant is somebody else, how does all of these conditions and responsibilities fall and who becomes ultimately responsible? Again, just to help me balance the equation on this process because we have a lot of conditions here generally.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Maybe discussing with Greg, perhaps with the dedication of the well to Department of Water Supply, the responsibility for the conditions of this then falls upon Department of Water Supply. Is that kind of what you’re saying?",0,C1,03/19/2024
These conditions would be applied to NELHA and HHFDC. I can tell you in discussions with DWS that a condition of dedicating that well to the County would be that we continue to pay for these conditions.,0,C1,03/19/2024
"So, you would be responsible for the monitoring, the reporting?",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Yes, we’ve agreed to do that. It’s not an issue as far as we’re concerned.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"I guess you triggered this and I had to think about it, Chair. Under 1a on that fee that we’re assessing, you said that would be an approach and holistic pattern. Have we determined that policy on how these fees and how it’s going to be, or is this a one off?",0,C1,03/19/2024
"the intention is we will have conversations both with CWRM and even the AG’s office. Do we need to do a rule amendment, can we just put that as a condition? I don’t know what the answer is, all I know is I think the outcome has to be a more equitable sharing of these costs.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"In determining that amount and for that period of that, are we there?",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Dean, are we there?",0,C1,03/19/2024
"I don’t need an answer, but philosophical question. If you’re going to put in for lack of a better word, tax on users.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"It’s a fee, it’s not a tax.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Whatever you want to call it, a license or whatever it is. Is a mechanism in place for this process to be equitable and not arbitrary and capricious? I don’t need an answer right now.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"It’s a very specific number, can you shed light on how it was calculated?",0,C1,03/19/2024
"No, I don’t. I wasn’t involved in the...",0,C1,03/19/2024
I think it was proportional to the amount of pumpage of the well.,0,C1,03/19/2024
"Again, you’re focusing on one user and that is not equitable. I don’t need an answer today.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"But it may be the one-time fee up front is based upon a calculation then there’s an annual registration fee that you pay every year. We have not worked out the details, but I think that is the goal because in talking to NELHA and HHFDC, that was an issue. How come we’re the only one that’s being charged this? Point well taken. It made me think, okay I think we have to find a more equitable way. It’s not that we can say we’re not going to do it, but how do we equitably distribute especially for those who already have a well permit. How do we make them share in this because they have limited capacity and to go out and monitor and to do all these other great things, we need capacity or we need resources. This is something we are exploring.",0,C1,03/19/2024
But in this case this applicant has also agreed to other conditions in terms of establishing monitoring ongoing.,0,C1,03/19/2024
It’s probably a good model for us to look at for future applicants who have similar kinds of requests.,0,C1,03/19/2024
"This is not a water management area, correct? Everybody has equal rights that are correlative rights of overlying landowners. The issue in the future is that suppose this well goes in and we start seeing some effects, it’s not just this landowner that has to decrease their use. All the others have to do it in some equitable way and if someone else comes in later on and it affects it, it’s not first come first served in this area. It has to be, so that’s an issue we’re going to have to face as long as we’re not in a water management area. I also want to raise the issue for now is that we’re placing a whole lot of mandatory conditions on this well drilling permit. We had a discussion about that before, that’s all I got to say about that.Fair point. Part of this was they wanted to move forward, NELHA and HHFDC, contested case hearing was filed, encouraged them to meet with the community to come up with some conditions that would be more acceptable to them. As a result, they withdrew their contested case. That’s not to say that somebody else may not file a contested case, but at least they have found a path forward.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"But if we put it in the conditions, a different issue all together.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"I’m Loke Aloua, my attorney Ashley Obrey of Native Hawaiian Legal Corp has submitted testimony and I’m not going to regurgitate that. I just hope that there can be some answers to what the process is going to be moving forward with responses to our hui’s questions, for NELHA regarding these revisions that they are requesting. That’s one thing for sure and then I just have just some other comments so please look at the letter. I’m not going to recover it, but I keep hearing the term equity thrown around in this meeting and I really have to say, there is no equity until there’s true justice for the illegal seizures of Hawaiian lands and waters by the continued illegal US occupation. NELHA sits on 800 acres of stolen land. These people were evicted upon NELHA’s creation. Families were taken off these lands and if you look back through the historical record since 1848, Native Hawaiians have been asking for access to these lands to live on and they’ve been denied that access. This is just a continuation of that colonial legacy of denying Native Hawaiians land while also creating the situation of not enough housing. We have 800 acres at NELHA, we have at least 500 million gallons of water being used there, we have zero homes, zero families housed, but somehow they have access to all of these resources. We cannot be talking about equity in this space until we’re talking about true justice. What we’re trying to do is damage control. The other thing is you folks keep talking about a regional approach. The Department of Water Supply hasn’t provided an updated water use and development plan to provide the regional approach that we’re looking for. This well by well is not going to work. We need something that’s updated which this Commission has asked for under Chair Case. You guys had a lot of really great comments for the Department of Water Supply and somehow those plans are not provided. We have environmental reviews right now sitting on our laps for two more wells that are already waiting for this to move through. Josh Green has secured $5 million from the legislature this year for this project, which is still going through the consultation process, I’m critiquing the process, we’re uplifting NELHA when really we need to be uplifting Kaleo because Kaleo is the reason that this had worked out. Without Kaleo, I’m really curious how this going to work moving forward because he was a source of trust for the community. He really held us together, he brought us together, and it’s not to knock on NELHA’S efforts but it’s to really put Kaleo back in his place. Another comment on Kaleo is ever since Kaleo left, we’ve been left in the dust. That was partly my concern which I shared with Kaleo. When Kaleo was in the position I said Kaleo, what going to happen when you no stay? What can happen to us as a community? He said just trust the process and Kaleo isn’t here and that’s not Kaleo’s fault, but it shows that if Kaleo’s not here what’s next for us as community members? I’m requesting transparency over the process to really know what to expect next because I’ll be honest, ever since Kaleo left it kind of just feels like NELHAs going to do what they want. We asked NELHA, okay we have to take some time to think about what they gave us, so we asked them, hey we have some other additional comments. It was like a stroke of a brush, hey guess what you guys like know, you guys go CWRM, you guys go sit inside a meeting and then that’s when we’re going to address your concerns. That’s not community. I’ve never ever told anybody in my community as somebody who’s responsible to my community that kine answer. That’s not one answer. I just really need your guys help, CWRM, please help with the water use and development plan. Please help to get us some answers for the questions we have. We just want to know and we would like it in a written document so that we can have it for our documents and to share with our keiki about what is exactly happening here. Even if in the end things are going to stay as they are because I’m just me, I’m just trying to bring some things forward. In the end, we need some radical realigning because climate disaster is on its way. My family and I was just in Lahaina running away from those fires and I tell you taking water from the aquifer, you’re increasing the surface air temperature, all of those temperatures everything is rising and everything is in sync. What happened in Lahaina is happening in Kona and we’re lineal descendants of Lahaina and we moved to Kona because we’re lineal descendants of Kona from my grandma’s side. Now we’re getting the same issue repeating itself in Kona and nobody here, not even me, should be tapping my back telling me I did one good job because we have so much that we have to repair. There’s so much that we have to prioritize. Kona needs help. There’s two more wells coming, 2 more million gallons. If we’re looking at projections USGS gave you folks for what the recharge might be, looking at mid-century we’re looking at a decline of 33 - 53%. That leaves us with just a few million gallons of water left under your folks equation for sustainable yield, but folks are saying today, hey the outdated plan is final, the WUDP, therefore we get more, there’s more water to use. That’s a problem. Sustainable yield is changing, it shouldn’t have changed. That doesn’t indicate environmental health but then at the same time we’re talking about, this is really great for regional approaches. There is no regional approach. This is well by well. We want regional approach, too. Please help us, I know you guys know this because a lot of you guys we’ve seen but we need that WDP updated. NELHA, you need to do better. This isn’t your first time, you’ve been in Kona a long time, you need to do better to show up for your community and to help us because this is the only first time you’re doing this kind monitoring. Show up for Kona. Pau already guys come take, take, take, no can. I talk to businesses at NELHA and they tell me we get issues with NELHA. We need transparency over the process as well because not everybody that should have been in these meetings was talked to. I talked to kuleana landholders who have title in Lanihau, they never was talked to and that’s not to say that all the people that were talked to weren’t valuable, but it is to say that we still aren’t getting the people that we need to at the table. We just need more transparency and I’m also bringing this up because I’m asking for transparency from future wells that we work with ʻAha Moku and outside of ʻAha Moku because not everybody believes or can trust ʻAha Moku yet. We need a process for the broader community to come in because I cannot be sitting over here giving all these answers to everybody because it’s really not all fine and dandy. It’s not all good, you guys. Please help us. Thank you, but please help us.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"I really appreciate your time on this issue. I’m here with Loke and Kimberly, who’s also on the call. They’re part of Hui Ola Ka Wai who’s been a part of this process for quite some time now since this well was first proposed. With this long history of how things have gone and the well-being, decision making on the well at first being deferred for the purpose of consultation, trying a little bit better to understand the impacts. The year and a half long process that Kaleo went through of talking to community, a number of meetings, a number of discussions and drafts to reach like some consensus on the conditions that were approved back in August 2022. Then there was this really long pause after NELHA’s request for contested case hearing and not sure what was going on and my client Hui Ola Ka Wai had not heard anything from NELHA until January 31st. My understanding from this meeting is that there had been discussions being had for about six months, so it’s a little frustrating because I think this hui has been a part of the process from the get-go and rightly so, there’s expectation that we would have been among the first talked to. Not to say the only ones talked to, I agree with everything Loke said. There are a lot more people in the community and I don’t think it’s the burden of Hui Ola Ka Wai or anybody to go tell NELHA who they should be talking to but there needs to be a better process to make sure more community is involved. I think that would have been remedied by more open-door meetings, public meetings and just more advanced notice. The WDP is important, we keep talking about this regional approach, the necessity of really thinking through how best to approach Kona’s water at this point. This is the first well since the failed designation, this is setting the tone for everything that comes after because this is in a designated area. There’s no regional plan to rely on so there’s just a lot of concerns and I think we put a lot in our testimony, it’s about four pages. The process is really important, I think that’s the bottom line. We can appreciate that this is an effort to increase mitigation efforts and I think mitigation is always great, obviously, but without going through the process, without really understanding the impacts, without talking to all the right people or at least creating opportunity for all the right people to sit in the room, it just makes it hard to know where things are going. I think Loke also pointed to the fact that there were some concerns that were raised in the emails back and forth between myself and NELHA addressing some of the concerns we had about the red lines and things and so there was still some outstanding questions. There were some modifications that we would have requested and maybe some of it was touched on today, but not really. If we can force some of that information out before any kind of decision making down the line, I think that’s really important as well. Just to reiterate the comments that Hui Ola Ka Wai just really wants us to all get on the same page in terms of what’s next for water for Kona and how we can work together to make this a process that really works for the community. I think that’s all.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Can I ask you, what would you want to see as your as process? What are you recommending?",0,C1,03/19/2024
"We put general bullets in the testimony, I don’t want to completely read everything but I’m going to reference it so that I don’t miss anything. We’re talking about ensuring that there are these open meetings, that it’s not just like we’re going to make a few phone calls here and there and talk to a hundred people, but I don’t really know who’s been talked to. I don’t know who was invited to these meetings outside of the select few that were chosen and I’m not sure how those people were chosen in the first place. Figuring out ways to make things more open and transparent. I may not have the perfect solution, but I’m trying to throw out these ideas. Working on that water use and development plan, I don’t know how we engage DWS in the right way to get things moving.",0,C1,03/19/2024
Have you asked them?,0,C1,03/19/2024
"I have not recently, I have not. It has been raised in the past. I’m trying to remember at a meeting, some kind of finance meeting a while back. It’s been at least over a year for sure.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"That’s really their schedule, right? We will encourage them.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"I think it’s important, we’re thinking about the public trust and our kuleana, your kuleana, not you specifically, but as a body, as the State to make sure that these resources are managed properly for future generations. You can’t do that without those plans and those plans are part of the Code and the whole thing. I think that’s an important step and maybe that would play, the next bullet that we shared in the testimony, talking about requiring full environmental study for all wells. Whether or not that’s a requirement under the law I think that’s part of the planning process. Just thinking through what this is going to look like yeah from a regional perspective and how all these wells will work together long term. It’s all there and I don’t mean to just reiterate, but I think there’s some things in the written testimony that could be helpful. I know there are others who want to speak so I’ll be here for questions if anything.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"Aloha Chair, Commissioners, and Deputy. Again, we have more of our detailed points in our testimony submitted by Ashley and Native Hawaiian Legal Corp. Today I just really wanted to remind us why all of these conditions are so important and as times have changed I feel like it is important that the way that we make decisions change. When we’re throwing around the word equitable to everybody and how we start imposing, what’s it registration fees and things like that, reminding us that as we grow smarter, as we grow wiser, these things are what come with that kuleana that we carry. As we’ve been hosting students for the last spring session, one of my favorite things to reiterate is this full circle connection from mauka to makai because we’re drawing the water from up mauka but it does in fact make its way makai and the importance of every single drop of that water. If you can imagine the way the forests used to look with the koa, with the kukui, with the ‘ulu, with the ferns, with the lichen, and everything in between and how that water used to be purified and put into the aquifer and then that water would make its way down to the kai where it would grow all of the diatoms. It would grow all of the limus, it would grow the phytoplankton and the zooplanktons, and that would feed our nearshore fisheries, our reef fish, our herbivores, and it would work its way up the chain. It would then feed our predators. When our herbivores and our predators and our reef fish would spawn, that spawn would go out into the ocean and feed our pelagic, it would feed our whales, it would feed our ‘ahi, would feed all of these mea ‘ono that we have out there that we are so fond of in Kona. Kona gets to be known as the sports fishing capital of the world and I just kind of want to reiterate that and kind of share the irony that we are allowing this well to be permitted for NELHA who wants to increase their growth capacity of these fish in cages in the name of resource management and sustainability by removing those resources from their place where they’re supposed to be. I think what they’re doing is just barely scraping the top of what their kuleana is to give back. Although housing is needed and all of these things are needed in Kona, we live in a multigenerational family house, it’s really important that we step back and think about what the damage is done what would be better and how to move forward in the most pono way. I think they’re really just scraping the top of the barrel of what their kuleana needs to be to give back to the community in their capacity of taking. Mahalo.",0,C1,03/19/2024
"We had a couple well permits today and I’ve been thinking in the case of where we have surface waters, the Commission works with USGS to have stream gauges but we really haven’t thought as much as maybe we should about those groundwater connections. Hawaii island, in particular, the streams aren’t on the surface, so how do we do our due diligence in terms of monitoring? Sure, there’s deep monitoring wells, but maybe there’s some lighter weight methods. I don’t know what they are, it does sound like what NELHA has proposed at the near onshore basal monitoring is probably...I don’t know what the costs are but they do seem useful and more feasible. Each island is different. On Hawaiʻi island, all the water comes out below ground. It doesn’t have to be massively expensive geophysical research. That’s nice, university does it, but I think there needs to be different approaches to monitoring and I do think that community members have a lot of knowledge. They know where the punawai are, they know where the luʻuwai are and that’s information that I think we need for decision making. It’s better if it doesn’t have to emerge out of these conflicts. I would like to see us also request the water use development plan updates from Hawaiʻi County, just to say how’s it going, what’s the status, and create that forum so it’s not individuals who are frustrated who are having to ask. The other comment I have is less for staff, but I ask to testifiers. I think it seems like NELHA has made a good faith effort, but I work in the sciences and oftentimes people are intimidated by community or may not know who in the community to talk to or understand the texture of that community. What is the ability of a group and they pointed out that not everybody trusts Aha Moku. Aha Moku is what we see on the state side, but what’s the ability of Hui Ola Ka Wai to convene or help identify who isn’t being talked to because I think it’s a little hard to assume that NELHA knows or has the pull or has the credibility. They might invite someone to talk, but what if they don’t show up? Is there some way for a community organization like Hui Ola Ka Wai to create some of that space? I’ll just put it out there, maybe it’s naive of me. I’m new to this Ota Well conflict and Keauhou failed designation preceded me, but I do see some kuleana on the Commission side and opportunities for helping us do the right thing.",0,C1,03/19/2024

"If I may, the formula that they came up with was actually something that had been proposed as part of the leasing process for East Maui in order for the applicant in that case to help fund the watershed management plan. Rather than reinvent the wheel per 171-58(e), the applicant is supposed to come with the watershed management plan, but in that case a watershed management plan already exists. How can they basically help support implementation of that plan? In this case for the Ota Well, they hold that formula that they use in that case and it’s in the submittal where it’s water use in MGD / available water in MGD * the annual management cost. There is a watershed management plan for the Honuaʻula Forest Reserve and so that’s where the total cost for that was identified as $525,500 per year. Based on the water use and the available water came up to that amount. That’s all in the submittal and I believe there’s a table of values in the back of...",0,C1,03/19/2024

"But you can’t get there in one step. We take a little step forward and start to reinstitute this nexus between the users and the source, but do we drop all the federal or state funding we get for watershed management? No, we’re going to take that while we can and create a better balance of contribution between the users and generic contributors through tax payments or philanthropy. I just feel like directionally, we’re correct. We are far from there, but it’s a step you take and then the next one and the next one that gets us closer.",0,C1,03/19/2024

"I was just wondering in regards to the Kauaʻi production of what you're doing. Is it the original expansion area that you want replenished or it's been reduced right? The area for the fishing? Am I on the right page? I'm looking at number three, the Kauaʻi one.",1,B3,12/19/2023
I don’t understand the question.,1,B3,12/19/2023
"The boundaries, have they been somehow stricken, decreased for the area that you're particularly looking at?",1,B3,12/19/2023
Have you seen the map?,1,B3,12/19/2023
I'm looking at for the surface water hydrologic limits to these areas on Kauaʻi like Waikomo and I'm wondering have you been given a limit and now you want an expansion of the limit to the hydrologic area?,1,B3,12/19/2023
"I'll try to frame it. Throughout the State, Dr. Ayron Strauch works with all of our streams and so throughout the State and what the Water Code talks about is us establishing and these hydrologic units, fancy term of what we consider the watershed or the catchment basin for all of our streams. That's an administrative boundary, it's lines drawn on a map of what we consider a hydrologic unit that we manage. The current Waikomo hydrologic unit actually on paper took away some of the streams so there were natural streams that flowed but on paper the line was cut.",1,B3,12/19/2023
So it has been decreased?,1,B3,12/19/2023
"I wouldn't say it's been decreased it's just the line that was drawn on paper doesn't actually match what's actually happening on the ground, on the land. What we're trying to do is say in this area use Mānoa as an example. It's like drawing a line through the middle of the valley and saying we're going to split that stream in half. What we're saying is we need to make sure that we manage the stream from its headwaters all the way out to the ocean. Right now as drawn on the map in Kauaʻi it cuts off certain streams on paper and so we're just trying to correct an administrative line that was drawn from the Commission in order to clearly reflect what's happening on the land there in that hydrologic unit. That's all we're doing.",1,B3,12/19/2023
"There's no change of water allocation, it's really just the boundaries, making it more consistent with like Kaleo said on paper.",1,B3,12/19/2023
"Yes, to match what's happening on the ground.",1,B3,12/19/2023
"Does that affect obviously the farmers and the irrigation, what they're growing?",1,B3,12/19/2023
"No, this is an administrative management tool that gives us kind of a weight of water budget. How much people use, where their diversions are on the stream, those are built infrastructure and those go through separate permitting and regulatory processes. If you wanted to actually take water out of a stream that you don't have access to, you come to the Commission for a water use stream diversion permit. This action today is purely administrative, it's not actually taking water away, reducing water in any way shape or form. What it’s doing is on paper correcting what's actually happening on land.",1,B3,12/19/2023
I was just concerned if it would take away from communities and cut down on their availability.,1,B3,12/19/2023
"No, that's not the action proposed today.",1,B3,12/19/2023
"Thanks for the question, are you a resident of Kauaʻi?",1,B3,12/19/2023
"Oh okay, you seem very interested in Kauaʻi.",1,B3,12/19/2023
I'm interested in the water everywhere.,1,B3,12/19/2023
"It's just a comment for Deputy, given we heard about the Kauaʻi Water Use and Development Plan. Can we make sure that this change is communicated?",1,B3,12/19/2023
I will comment that the Water Use and Development Plan is very much focused on the water use side and that the majority of the data and the focus is on potable water. As you can see there was very little attention to surface water or non- potable sources and they were defining everything by groundwater hydrologic unit which is a different administrative boundary.,1,B3,12/19/2023
"Getting to what you're saying we will incorporate and obviously communicate with the County in making sure that actions taken by this board are consistent with their water use development plans, that's a given. One of the things that we're trying to continuously work on is the connection between surface water and groundwater and how those are regulated and managed by our agency as well as how that's implemented on the ground by various purveyors. You have in the Hawaii Water Plan context that you presented the Department of Water Supply is developing this water use and development plan but they are one of many purveyors of water. That's where people get confused or oftentimes have issues because a lot of what's presented is focused on their specific systems, not the overall water needs. What you hear is that they struggle getting access to some of that other data whether it's private water systems, irrigation systems, non-potable demands because they are one purveyor of many and they're focused specifically on potable water versus for example the planning department or some other county entity that could access higher level policy data that integrates planning and water resource management. Those are things that we're working on and I think are going to become more important as we look at management throughout the State moving forward. The integration of how do we coordinate surface water IFS establishment which then allows for water to be used for off stream needs that then can sometimes also augment and support groundwater development and groundwater potable source development strategies.",1,B3,12/19/2023
I just noticed that Grow Farm submitted a letter.,1,B3,12/19/2023
There are over a thousand land owners in the area and we did not reach out to a thousand people to get their input. This is really an administrative issue that we needed to address as we came across it doing data gathering. It wasn't a full-on community engagement needed for this administrative thing. Obviously when we go to addressing actual water sources and water uses and various owners of stream diversion works and reservoirs and irrigation systems we will engage with them and we actually do engage with them pretty much quarterly in the field. We are working hand-in-hand and with them.,1,B3,12/19/2023
I think this is a unique action that people misunderstood what we’re doing here.,1,B3,12/19/2023

"Your last column, percent of land, is that the percent of land that's irrigable and that's the limit by amount of water you have or is that?",0,C1,12/19/2023
"For the Kīlauea aquifer system area, if there's only 0.3 million gallons of supply and you wanted to irrigate at 3,400 gallons per acre per day, you could only irrigate 5% of the 1,700. Again, the 0.32 is the best available published number that there is.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Seems high. Okay, I just wanted clarification about that percentage.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Department of Water Supply and Kauaʻi supports about what percentage of the population or the island? Because you named different purveyors but just for me to get a sense of who are the players there for drinking, for portable water.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"I don't know about an exact percentage but it is the vast majority of the island. There are, as Amanda mentioned, Princeville, Gay & Robinson a couple of the small State sites, but if I were to guess would be in the 99% area.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Thank you for your presentation. Lucky you live Kauaʻi. The gap between use and sustainable yield, Kauaʻi truly exemplifies waiwai. The literal meaning of that word, you’re blessed with a rich resource. Neal, this is in part for C1 as well. When I look at slide 3 and see what is characterized as being protective, that our role is to be protective of a resource, I don't think that really speaks as well as it could to what this body does. You shared with us I believe at our last meeting the constitutional preamble that recognizes Hawaiʻi’s desire to really celebrate the uniqueness of our islands and expresses the state motto, ua mau ke ʻea o ka ʻāina i ka pono, and that we wish to preserve this. I think we have a more active role, not just a protective, security guard role but to balance the interests of the life of the land with the needs of the people, not only in this generation but in future generations. Let's be real clear that we're not just trying to hold back stuff from people who want stuff now, we're trying to balance the needs and interests of what the land needs and the ʻāina needs, what the Lāhui needs, and what future generations need. I would hope that we really express that a little bit more clearly. These are just shorthand labels of course, I'm not trying to wordsmith, but I really want to make sure we get what we do correctly. In your district-by-district models, you have sustainable yield as a static assumption and you had growth demand as a dynamic assumption. Do you have access to data? Because I don't think sustainable yield is going to be static and it'd be fairer and more accurate if we had access, whether from our team or USGS or whoever to really reflect what we've heard. It's way more impactful on an island like Maui or some of the other islands that aren't blessed with your resources to understand that sustainable yield may be here now but it may go down in the future because of the climatic change. I think it would build up the presentation if we had dynamic assumptions about where sustainable yield is going to be in the future. You’re at such a big gap I don't think it's going to matter, but I think it's the discipline of looking at things in that matter. The final comment I have is how long are we going to keep clinging to plantation era assumptions about agricultural land? Plantations are gone, they're not coming back. We're in a new era and I don't put this all on the county or the consultants and so forth, but as a community we need to really rethink those assumptions to what the need is now and what the need will be in the future as we develop sustainable food systems and so forth. We're not developing new plantations, it's going to be something different. If you have comments or questions or comments on the comments but I guess there's more comments than questions.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"I'll just say thank you for those comments and with respect to future sustainable yields and climate change, we spoke with the Water Department and the consultant about that and the approach right now is these are actually established by the Commission. But we will be looking at possible future adjustments to sustainable yield based on future rainfall estimates, future recharge estimates, so that's something that if we do adjust these plans, we’ll adjust accordingly as Amanda was talking about a living document. That’s a good point.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Can I add on? Just because the climate change conversation came up. Are you aware you can now access models of future rainfall projections for the island and is that incorporated? I know usually you look to Water Resource Protection Plan for this information but really starting the conversation right now while you're in these public interfaces about how to think proactively about the future declines in rainfall which are looking like they're over the center of the island. That's going to affect your base flow or your groundwater perhaps, even in wet season.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"In the part we just have a general description of the potential impact of climate change. We do have the old rainfall atlas in there, we can maybe look at if a graph could be added.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Right now the Hawaii Climate Data Portal builds off of the atlas and you can look at future projections. There are different scenarios, there are some models that are a little bit more conservative, but you could see the range of projections and I think that's the best available science right now. Anybody can access it, just look up Hawaii Climate Data Portal. As you're talking, I'm looking up this data and going, okay. I think it would strengthen the Water Use Development Plan and really start the conversations at the community when you guys are having these where it needs to be at, like what does this mean for agriculture and the water quality in wells whatnot. I just wanted to point that out because sometimes the connection between the science and the decision-making is a little bit far.",0,C1,12/19/2023
Can I ask a question on that? I like that idea as far as incorporating it. Would it be directly impacting the sustainable yield because we just pulled that from the Water Resource Protection Plan or would it be a chapter that describes how it might impact the sustainable yield?,0,C1,12/19/2023
"The hard thing is people can predict rainfall but translating that into recharge, that's really tricky and takes time so I don't know if you want to wait on that, but this is already available on rainfall. You can say, well this is how we think it might affect dry season flows, wet season flows like irrigation demand because temperatures are increasing. There's going to be more evaporative demand and it might be a little bit more qualitative, but I think it's good because people are already thinking about this on Kauaʻi with flooding. If things are going to be a little bit more extreme, how do you have to manage for a less certain future? Even if you don't know you still have to prepare, so I think it would be really helpful to have that conversation in this.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Amanda, thank you for your presentation. You're using 2015 as your starting point. There have been quite a few, to me, cosmic events between now and 2015. Does that impact your analysis or how is that being comprehended in your analysis with the Kauaʻi General Plan? Secondly, at least on the non-potable existing water uses there's quite a few TBDs. Will you be looking to somehow capture that by the time the final plan is submitted for acceptance?",0,C1,12/19/2023
"To start off with the first question, we started in 2015 back when the description was approved. We did pause for a bit because we were waiting to see what the sustainable yield number came out to. It took a little bit of time to develop the full report. During that time, the 2018 General Plan was developed and before the 2018 General Plan was developed around the same time that we were working on the analysis, they had done a technical memorandum to look at these projections, so we are in line with their projected amounts. And yes, as you mentioned it was prior to some of these events happening, so we can take a look back and see if there's any adjustment. Overall, I think the bottom line is that the 20-year projections as you could see in the graphs were down at the bottom. Even if they did slow down during certain years or if there are slight adjustments, it's in the overall magnitude compared to sustainable yield, compared to full buildout, they would be somewhat insignificant.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Another thing to add, in that 2020 period of COVID the water demands and all of those things were not normal within that period. It seems maybe more within that 2015 or 2020 period might have been a possible look, but it seems like in the most recent years if we were to pull that data, it's still on the lower side of what it was historically around that 2015, 2014 time.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Second question about the lack of information on surface water, we'll touch base with Ayron and CWRM on if there's anything more recent, but generally the Agricultural Water Development Plan hasn't provided that and that's where we would otherwise get that information. It's kind of beyond what the Department of Water is able to do to gather that data.",0,C1,12/19/2023
There was a question asked earlier about the number of the amount of users that the Department of Water captures. How many private water purveyors are there on the island?,0,C1,12/19/2023
"Four? I think it's again Robinson, Princeville, the State Parks, and then DHHL.",0,C1,12/19/2023
And they provide metered water to their PUC-regulated companies?,0,C1,12/19/2023
"Yes, I'm not exactly sure about the State, those are in the State parks like Polihale and Kōkeʻe. There are maybe much smaller service areas, I'm not exactly sure how…are they regulated as a public? I'm not really sure about those.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"My question is, you're capturing domestic water use for a certain population of the island, how are the private water users being integrated into the Water Use Plan? I see the municipal, I see the private water systems.",0,C1,12/19/2023
The private water systems are reflected in there because most of them do report. What you might have noticed or maybe what you're referring to is that in some areas domestic well usage wasn't. There's poor reportage in some cases so those might not have been reflected in the 20-year projections.,0,C1,12/19/2023
"Essentially, whatever we were able to obtain and collect is what is included in the report.",0,C1,12/19/2023
I guess is there a sense of what is missing? Is it material to your analysis?,0,C1,12/19/2023
"It would just be the domestic wells, so we can take a look back. The most significant would be Kīlauea that there were a handful of domestic wells and very little reportage but some of the domestic wells even though there are plenty, the amount of usage there versus a Department of Water system is different, the scope or the amount.",0,C1,12/19/2023
Those were concerns brought up by the community as far as the request to make sure that the reporting is better or the data that we're able to pull into our report is collected so that we can include it in our report.,0,C1,12/19/2023
"One last question and personally related to this is that in your projected water use slide for the Hanapēpē aquifer you have listed 904 acres at 3 million gallons a day. Is the coffee farm, the 2,700 acres part of the Makaweli or the Hanapēpē projected agricultural water use?",0,C1,12/19/2023
I need to double check on that. I can get back to you on that.,0,C1,12/19/2023
"I believe the 2,600 acres is just the Makaweli side of the ag portion. My last question is, how do you account for water that's being diverted from one aquifer to the next? Plantations used to do a lot of that and there's still some of that going on currently, surface water.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"In the surface water tables that were shown where we tied the diversion to an irrigation system and we didn't know if the service area was in a different aquifer system area. Say, well kind of a moot point now, but say Kekaha and Kōkeʻe Ditch. One of them was actually associated with a gaging station that was in Nāpali but we knew that the service area was down in Kekaha so we did move that over to the service area location.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"In your projected water use, on your percent of land that can be irrigated it's comprehended that number?",0,C1,12/19/2023
"I know that there’s been a community desire for greater housing development, so when we talk about full buildout, does that include any of the future housing development plans?",0,C1,12/19/2023
Within the State Plan there includes those projects. As far as other ones it’s just based on if it was built on the current zoning.,0,C1,12/19/2023
"The recent community plans, the Līhuʻe and South Kauaʻi community plans were also assessed.",0,C1,12/19/2023

Maybe we can ship some over.,0,C1,12/19/2023

"It has to do with surface water, Kauaʻi is a little bit different. Hanalei is a major poi producing area so how are irrigated kalo lands considered in agricultural water demand or are you only looking at the plantation infrastructure? From an agricultural side it's still an important agricultural production, but in other settings it's sort of a competing interest and on Kauaʻi it's part of the agricultural picture.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"The agricultural analysis, what we showed very overall broad brush, looked at the important agricultural land study. We do know that kalo can use a lot of water but we also know that it is flow through. We can take another look at that and how it's incorporated. We also do know of DHHL’s demands that were put into the State Water Projects Plan.",0,C1,12/19/2023
Was your question related to how is it accounted for in the report or how is it managed as a resource?,0,C1,12/19/2023
"When you were looking at like agricultural water use you used that 3,400 number and then you constrained it by available surface water based on diversions. Those would be plantation diversions, ʻauwai are not metered so I understand that. It's interesting because Kauaʻi challenges us to think about what we call agriculture is often not inclusive of traditional agriculture. Maybe there's a different way to think about it that makes sense for the island of Kauaʻi which is dependent or in this particular area. Water flows through it, irrigation for kalo is not a competing issue it's actually the main focus for Hanalei and maybe Makaweli. This is the intellectual in me thinking, huh Kauaʻi can make us think differently about water and irrigation and agriculture, given its diverse landscapes. Maybe I need to follow up with you on this but how we account for what's available surface water and what's agricultural production and how to make sure we have water for agricultural production should incorporate the diversity of things that are being grown. I don't know if that makes sense, maybe somebody can encapsulate it better, but it occurred to me that it's not only the plantation diversions that are important ag waters. If that can be addressed somehow or identified how you think about that. The last thing I had was you gave a lot of graphs but do you have these in map form about existing demand and projected growth like heat maps? The public and decision makers think in maps, not graphs often. Do you have those?",0,C1,12/19/2023
"These are our main graphs, we’ll need to talk to the Department of Water on if there's another graphic that would be helpful.",0,C1,12/19/2023
So it's mostly graphs?,0,C1,12/19/2023
It's mostly graphs like that.,0,C1,12/19/2023
"It's basically summarized that there's the initial island where it has all the aquifer systems and then it shows the breakdown of the hydrologic unit areas. As far as the translation of the information back to those, you'd have to kind of go back and forth between this is the visual area on the island and then this is the graph of that area.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"I'm saying this because there are metrics that are water stress indicators. They're used in global development but they can kind of help you identify it might be a ratio of supply to demand to highlight graphically some of the hot spots because the human brain doesn't generally look at a graph and go, ah ha! It might be useful for, well I know you guys are at the end of this process but helping explain and have good conversations in specific places. Just want to suggest.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"3,400 gallons per day, is that a standard number that's being accepted by the agricultural community for how much you need per acre?",0,C1,12/19/2023
"It was just pulled from that report. That's why, right?",0,C1,12/19/2023
Because that's a big difference.,0,C1,12/19/2023
"The 2,500 was used in Waiāhole and then 3,400 is out of the Ag Water Use and Development Plan which they only looked at a specific area and with a specific climate. Like Amanda mentioned in her presentation, that may vary but it's a planning number. It might be a little on the higher side, a little conservative in that sense I suppose, but people use it.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Versus a 2,500? Is that becoming a more acceptable number, the 34 versus the 25?",0,C1,12/19/2023
"I see people using the 3,400 referencing the 2004 Agricultural Water Use and Development Plan.",0,C1,12/19/2023
It makes a big difference when you're calculating several thousand acres.,0,C1,12/19/2023
"It does for sure but it's adopted plan, as well.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Just anecdotally, it seems to me Kauaʻi has a lot more rainfall than the other islands. I don't know how you would factor that in, but when you talk about averages it’s going to differ not just by crop but by where you are.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Sure and when it comes down to actual evaluation in water management areas, staff does use the IWREDSS (Irrigation Water Requirement Estimation Decision Support System) which is a demand model looking at climate, soil type, cropping, cropping practices and things like that to get a more accurate estimate. But for planning purposes it could be on the high side given Kauaʻi is probably the wettest island, but there are some dry sides as you know.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Let me let me ask another question then. How significant are reservoirs on Kauaʻi in terms of agricultural irrigation? All I know about reservoirs on Kauaʻi are the ones that busted but it seems to me that if we're talking about reservoirs, are they just an insignificant amount of water over there for agriculture or are they a significant source?",0,C1,12/19/2023
There are several significant reservoirs remaining.,0,C1,12/19/2023
It seems to me that with climate change people start worrying about whether they should start storing more water in the future.,0,C1,12/19/2023
There's definitely a lot of feedback as far as discussions about land owners or reservoir owners looking to decommission them for liability and all that maintenance related activities and cost. Then there's definitely a lot of feedback from some of the communities as far as expressing the interest to keep them for the purpose of ag and promoting all of these kind of things. I don't know how to truly respond since it's not really part of the Water Departments but we do acknowledge and I wanted to relay that that is a concern.,0,C1,12/19/2023
"It was just a curiosity question, that's all.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"I will say that our engineering department as a result of Kaloko, legislation was passed where we are doing dam safety. There's been a major push by our engineering department, they've done an assessment of all the dams and reservoirs and they've issued notices of violations. People are having a choice, you either upgrade or you decommission but there's a tension now between fire suppression that these reservoirs should be made available. Last week Friday at the Land Board meeting, I think it was in Kalihiwai or maybe it was Wailua the original landowner had proposed to decommission, that new land owners, a hui, have now reconsidered and it's quite a large reservoir. People are paying a lot more attention. There is a $10 million grant program, that's monies that will be available to private land owners to upgrade or even decommission their reservoirs but again I think with fire suppression becoming a real concern there is a reconsideration by some including government on whether we should be taking over some of those reservoirs to ensure an adequate amount of water is available for fire suppression.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"The Kīlauea public meeting, which is the nearest to Kalihiwai, that was one of the big items.",0,C1,12/19/2023
That was a positive movement by those land owners.,0,C1,12/19/2023
"Chair, I want to go back to your point about the average requirement to support agriculture. That's the danger of averages because if people come to expect that you can supply it in a wet area like Kauaʻi, in an aid area that's an unrealistic number. We have to start to adjust our expectation, we can't apply the average across the board, it has to be contextual to the supply that we have and then your choice of agricultural production is going to have to relate to what's available. It’s not like the plantation days where you could move water from here to there, that's why all that plantation criteria is so anachronistic and dangerous because it still assumes that, but the only way that was possible was because of things we can't do now or don't do now. I appreciate the point about reservoirs, that's why if you want more water in an area you have to invest in infrastructure and that investment is generational and it's large. There's some public purpose served to it for fire suppression so we have to think about how we're going to invest in that. Really, if you wait for the landowner to do it who's got an agricultural crop, they're going to decommission every time. Our government has to work in partnership with private sector to really say, okay we're going to contribute a certain amount of this because it serves a public purpose. You get a real return for your investment and they’re going to balance.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"I just wanted to add my two and a half cents here in this discussion. West Kauaʻi is deemed as the agricultural area of the island that the development plan focuses on and to have sustainable ag you need three things. You need soil, you need sunlight, and you need water, so generally you don't want it in a very rainy area and the use of 3,400 gallons per day per acre is really a function of where you're taking it, how you're using it, and how you're storing it. Reservoirs, at least for the 3,700 acres of coffee are key because we can take water, during the last several weeks we had a lot of rain coming through. We can store that water and save it for when there is no rain and if we can't do that or ag can't do that they'll have to start drilling water like in the Central Valley of California and we want to avoid that competing with potable water sources using it for ag. I think the balance here is that we need to have storage capacity, we need to be able to balance the high flows with the low flows. We just had a meeting of fire suppression with the county with the PMRF and with private landholders and what assets were available to help fight wildfires and water supply for. Reservoirs is one of the key factors there. I think all of this in your Water Use and Development Plan is key. One last comment, you made a reference to that the part of this plan is in the Water System Improvement Plan, I think the integration between surface water use, groundwater use would really help identify where you, the Department of Water would be doing its capital investing. That's my comments and I look forward to the plan when it's submitted to us for approval.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"I am going to, Kaleo, challenge CWRM. This daily average 3,500, 2,500, it's going to be a lot. It's going to be very critical that if we're going to tailor something based upon location or types of crops that we have some kind of form because this has already come up and it will continue to come up. As we look at water allocation I think we need to have some kind of a mechanism to appropriately consider all of these factors in coming up with that formula because it does concern. There's a very big difference between 2,500 and 3,500 and I've got DOA saying 3,400.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"The update that was a couple years ago that Department of Ag presented, they actually increased that number to like 5,600 gallons per acre per day, but what we've been working on and pushing back on and challenging our agencies to think about is critiquing that number and evaluating how we came up with that data. As Neal said, our IWREDSS model is a really useful tool and what we've been trying to do is make that front-facing so community applicants or agricultural practitioners can access that and play around with scenarios when they're doing their conservation planning. They're like, okay we're going to do drip irrigation or in certain areas going to do spray, we can get to a decent quantity sometimes beyond the 3,400 gallons per day based on crop type. We can present this back Commission on IWREDSS, it would be very enlightening for not only the public but this Commission to see what tools we do use and currently have available to us.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"First of all, I want to thank everybody for the work that's gone into what's happened here and the discussion underway. I appreciate that Commissioner Katayama mentioned that this probably should be 2025 to 2045 as opposed to having the data start in 2015. Also want to appreciate Commissioner Hannah’s, his input on the reservoirs are significant and wanted for future use even if they aren't being used right now a lot. We are very conscious of the future, we could have changes. I will be meeting with the Department of Water next month to really drill down on some of the specifics that are of concern, but I want to comment that Moloaʻa, the information here is insufficient. There's a concentration of wells, I know even in one square mile area we have about 65 wells, many of which are being…Moloaʻa is a problematic area because we don't have county water really running through there and those wells are having a problem staying filled with water. The Kīlauea yield does not meet the demand. I want to highlight that the county has gone through great lengths to purchase 50 acres to put in some affordable housing program and we also did just get a special permit issued for a 7th through 12th high school, middle school right there across from the county housing in Kīlauea and both we don't see where we're going to have the water for it. We have a 1- million-gallon tank that we're hoping to put up in Kīlauea and I think if we have that it should help. I also want to just acknowledge the striking lack of reference to the Waiahi surface water treatment plant that feeds basically Līhuʻe, Puhi, Hanamāʻulu and that can range much further than that. My understanding it has the potential to reach all the way to Kalaheo to Keālia. These are the type of questions I want to figure out, how we get the Waiahi surface water treatment plant on there and then also I want to just ask I didn't see water reservations in there for the DHHL development plans that are underway. I might have missed it, I didn't see like in January we're going to be breaking ground in Hanapēpē and our service to our Hawaiian beneficiaries has been long overdue, so thank you so much. Those are my key points and I'm looking forward to working with the Department of Water coming up soon next month.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"My name is Melania Kekaula and in reference to this, of course, I have a question, I have two actually. The first one is do we know whether the aquifer like the one on both sides of the island, in recent years have they remained the same as say maybe 40 years or what is the trend? Are they the same or have they decreased in amount of water because that's important to whatever we plan right now and going forward. The second question is I just love the presentation and the breakdown of water use, that was amazing, thank you. But I noticed that the agriculture was not included and I just wondered why? Thank you.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Normally we don't take questions, but if you'd like to answer them and if you can, would you like to answer that?",0,C1,12/19/2023
"So far as the agricultural, we did that separately because we do have a lot more information on groundwater and the land use plans and policies, surface water, as we've gone over extensively here. There's a lack of available information on that. I'm sorry if that doesn’t answer your question, but we did do that separately with just that chart.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Okay, I hope that answers your question.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"And then the second question was agriculture, did you?",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Aloha mai kākou, Commissioners. For the record, my name is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer on this item, I'm here as a water consultant to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. A few observations from and reactions to the presentation. It was good that the consultants mentioned one well known and significant limitation to sustainable yield which is there's a gulf between sustainable yield and developable yield. If you're not aware, it didn't seem to be in the presentation. That's a very significant issue on Kauaʻi in particular where lots of wells are drilled and you just can't extract much water because of the density of the rock. I don't know what the gulf is between that but having that on the charts would probably be meaningful. I'll just highlight for you, the 2019 Water Use and Development Plan which updated sustainable yields for the state which is the numbers that are being used in this plan, this is reflective of Commissioner Hannah's comment, has an extensive discussion of we know that climate change is real, we know that rainfall is decreasing, and we're not taking into account new data in setting the sustainable yields. The sustainable yields that are reflected in this update aren't actually likely accurate whatsoever so should be aware of that. Adding another line of projected sustainable yields, the same kind of analysis you went through for Maui designation might be meaningful. Just in case it's not top of your mind, other limitations to sustainable yield include the assumption that wells are equally placed across the landscape, are all at the same depth, are pumping at the same rate, that geology is uniform throughout the aquifer, that there's laminar flow, that precipitation and recharge across the aquifer is the same which is of course not true anywhere in Hawaiʻi. There's a whole host of things but most importantly for groundwater dependent ecosystems where groundwater is flowing into the coast, there's no explicit accounting for that in the setting of sustainable yields. I think the biggest thing and this is the exact same methodology that was used for the Hawaii County Water Use and Development Plan sustainable yield, just because you're below sustainable yield does not equal you are sustainable. It is maybe a first run step of, okay we have a bunch of water here, maybe we're okay at providing for some future extractive uses but the analysis is not there to determine whether or not public trust uses including DHHL’s uses. I want to acknowledge the department did reach out, asked for a meeting with one staff member at the department. We did not know, however about the 2023 meetings and I'm aware that many of our beneficiaries did not know about the 2023 meetings. Looking on the website, there are meeting notes from those meetings but there's no attendance numbers so I just have no sense of how many people came. My concern and it's a concern for the success of this plan is that if this now goes to public hearing, there were five meetings in 2015 and five meetings in 2023 which may have not been well attended, if this now goes to public hearing for approval, the level of engagement and dialogue and improvement might be more frustrating than productive, absent additional public outreach. I only just saw that on November the draft plan was posted to the website at the end of November. We haven't reviewed it so don't have any specific comments.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Let me follow up with Amanda since you acknowledge the delta between sustainable yield and developable yield, is that a data point that you could put on to the maps?",0,C1,12/19/2023
"No, I'm not sure how we'd um come up with that line.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Maybe some theoretical discussion of it and how it could play a big role in how you think about utilization of resource. Use a case study, use an example here since you don't have data to apply it across the board. At least where you do have some knowledge, use that as an indicator of what the impact could be.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"We can take a look at that or see if there's any way to indicate even though these lines show full buildout is below it, that this these areas are getting close. Maybe those warrant a closer look and more in-depth analysis on a future update.",0,C1,12/19/2023

"CWRM is to hold public hearings, Kaleo. I know there are three hydrologic units, do you have a strategy on how you're going to hold these public meetings?",0,C1,12/19/2023
"This is specific for the Kauaʻi Water Use and Development Plan, so usually we just conduct one public hearing related to this and during COVID we've done most of them via Zoom. We can do it on island we'll coordinate to see what works best for Kauaʻi DWS and the community. We could hold more than one to provide opportunities, it just becomes a cost and resourcing issue but that is the next step in this process is to take this out for even more public information and receive comments on the draft plan.",0,C1,12/19/2023
"I do want to take Jonathan's comment, I don't want to take that lightly. I would rather have the community talk about this than when the matter comes back to CWRM for decision making, the community saying we never heard about this. Maybe there's a possibility of coordinating with some of the homestead associations to have meetings in some of these communities there that are being impacted or even just calling a meeting with all the homestead associations on Kauaʻi. That might be a really good opportunity to get good input. We have our own kuleana, we have to do a public meeting but that is not to preclude the Water Department from convening more public meetings. It is in your best interest to meet with as many people before it comes back to us where I think we prefer not to have, legitimate controversy yes, but if it's people that haven't heard, it's better that and I think we've already heard from some people that there's not enough…",0,C1,12/19/2023
"Getting back to developable yield since you can't get that number, you might use some of the numbers that we use which is 70%, 80%, 90% where you start to worry about reaching the developable yield even though the sustainable yield side I think what you said right now. Even though you can't call it the developable yield, you can see a warning sign something like that on the graph.",0,C1,12/19/2023

The permits for modifications was approved in June of last year, I believe, and that work is still forthcoming because they’re subject to other permits such as SMAs (Special Management Areas) or CDUP (Conservation District Use Permits) or Army Corp concurrence, that sort of thing.

"My name is Lucienne de Naie, I’m representing the Maui group of the Sierra Club. I’m also a Huelo resident that lives in this area and is familiar with many of my neighbors who live in this area and their uses of these various streams. Sierra Club did ask for these streams to be restored several years ago and grateful for the approval of the Commission; however, it has been very difficult to track the process. You notice no public comments, you notice no comments from Aha Moku Council. We have requested from the very beginning even on those streams that you approved on January 30th, the category 1, that there be a community site visit. Seeing is believing my neighbor Moses Kahiamoe, Sr. says and there’s truth to that. Seeing little pictures and charts with confusing numbers and two sets of numbers, it’s called this, it’s called that, the public cannot participate. I’m sorry, that’s only for policy wonks. You really need to stand there at a place where people may be familiar from going with their families and look and say, here’s what we’re planning to do here, is this kind of what you folks were hoping would help things? We’ve had years to do this. We waited several years, there’s just been no outreach. We are happy to reach out to people in the community and organize these kinds of accesses, we’ve done so before with Ayron, it’s turned out very well. You get useful comments, you find out what’s really going on. It should be a standard condition, everything that is being requested in the Huelo area and our intention is not to delay this permit. This site visit should have been offered before this meeting. This site visit should be offered after this meeting as a condition if it hasn’t been before because there’s still more permits coming up that require Army Corps, we’re being told. We participate in these quarterly meetings, they are very confusing, the time frame is very compressed, many different agencies need to report. There’s tiny little pictures that flash on your screen. We continually ask, please let us just stand there and look at these places. It’s not too much to ask, it’s a respectful thing for we are an applicant in a way, the Sierra Club is because we ask for this to be done. One of our board members lives right by Hoʻolawa Stream, one of our Sierra Club Maui group board members. She asked me, what’s being planned? I go, God it is so confusing I’ve asked for a site visit so someone can explain it to us. Even the staff didn’t realize there were still more permits to do. We need a time sheet, we need a spreadsheet that shows what is in this phase, what is in that phase. We’ve requested that, it has not been delivered. We understand the staff is really busy but we are willing to help set up some sort of a visit and seeing is believing. If we can see what’s proposed, we can really offer meaningful comments. Also, we are confused over which intake on Waipiʻo Stream number 8, L8 or L9 is actually meant by 238. On one staff report from 2022 it’s said to be Lowrie Intake 8, on the most recent one it’s said to be Lowrie Intake 9. They’re very different intakes, this is the one that requires the overpass. We’d sure appreciate knowing more what’s going on. We appreciate that these are being approved and moved forward and modifications made but gosh we live there, these things are in our backyard and the cultural impact documents that are offered are fragmented. Often, no questions were asked about these particular streams or diversions. We want to have a good process, we want to have a speedy process. Aha Moku reps would come to a community meeting, they live right in the Community, community members who live and depend upon these streams would come to a site visit but it’s very hard to hike to these places on our own. The roads are bad, there’s gates, there’s no key provided for our community use. If you drive an all-terrain vehicle, you can get to them fairly easily so you could have a very successful site visit if access were allowed that was driving access and the community was invited and those who could show up on that day would show up. Please, please, please make that a condition of every permit in the Huelo area. A thousand people live in the Huelo area, it’s not unoccupied...",1,B3,03/19/2024
"Can I ask, Mark, is that possible?",1,B3,03/19/2024
"I think that’s pretty much up to the Commission and the staff. For the majority of these, I think there have been visits, there just haven’t been recent visits, but they are aware of what’s going on out there.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"There’s something to be said about an independent assessment and I mean in the long run, I think this community needs to work with EMI. I do see some value. Commissioners, do you have comments or anything additional you want to add?",1,B3,03/19/2024
"I don’t want to delay the abandonment process, but maybe Lucienne, it would be best to go ahead and do it and then you guys go and check all these thing to see whether it’s been accomplished.",1,B3,03/19/2024
We can’t get access easily.,1,B3,03/19/2024
"That’s what I’m saying is that if they do the abandonment then you guys go over there and look it over and see whether it’s done, what was supposed to be done and whether you people have any kind of suggestions if there’s something else to be done.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"Commissioner Miike, when I bring this up with EMI, they go, it’s up to the commission. So, the ball is in your court to tell EMI to please do this. I’m sure they will comply, otherwise they don’t think it’s their kuleana.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"What I’m asking is that if we do put this as a condition, would you be happy with that? But to go ahead now and do the abandonment and go and then you guys go in and check?",1,B3,03/19/2024
"Yes, I already stated we have no wish to hold this up but please you have another set of permits coming up so make it that before you see those, there also needs to be a community site visit so that our only choice shouldn’t be holding things up in order to have something that we’ve requested over and over and over again. We requested this on category 1 permits that were approved in January. I couldn’t make it to that meeting and let you guys know that. It’s just sad. We requested it in 2020 for those permits.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"What I understand you’re saying, you have no objection to Commissioner Miike’s recommendation or comment about making this a condition after that the community can see whether the abandonments have been completed.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"We would actually like a site visit before they are started, not to hold them up, but to understand what is being planned before it’s done.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"Given the logistical access challenges, is something like drone footage that gets a little bit further away from looking at the specific structure be helpful? I’m just saying this because I know it would be for me, trying to visualize where and what is going on.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"Possibly, but that’s a lot of commitment time. We have to have a community meeting to view the drone footage and then if people have questions what are you going to say? Well, we can’t go up and see it, they won’t let us go. It’s better to stand there with people who have lived here all their lives and have them look at it and you can drive to all of these places.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"I understand the community, is that 1, is that 10, is that 20, is it 50? If we had a representative that and a representative of the community would accompany CWRM staff and the applicant to ensure that these the conditions have been complied with?",1,B3,03/19/2024
"You should have several representatives because each stream is different and you can’t expect one person to know every stream well, it’s not fair.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"Do we, the commission, have the regulatory authority to require an applicant to do something like this or do we just strongly encourage the applicant in a letter to embrace the community’s concerns? I just don’t know if we have that regulatory authority to require the applicant to do something. We could maybe have as a part of the application process, make the applicant go through a community meeting, but I guess that’s a question for the lawyers.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"I don’t see anything that it’s a requirement, but if CWRM needed more information or something then that’s one thing.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"What I’m also hearing, Mark, if it’s a condition you’re more apt to do it versus I don’t get a feeling that you’re going to voluntarily do this.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"It’s not that we’re withholding this opportunity, I know just over the years there have been multiple visits to some of these areas but discussions like this hadn’t been had at that time. CWRM staff has been there, Lucienne has been there, we haven’t all been there together talking about exactly what is happening. That’s, I think, what she’s looking for, but to entertain something like that we have to limit the group size so that it’s easier to get around, it’s easier to move, it’s easier to access. I do understand that and I think representatives of the community, certain representatives, absolutely. If that’s something that they’re looking for and you’re going to make it a condition of this permit, then we’re willing to comply. I just know that this has been done before.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"I just wanted to add that most, not all, of these sites are easily accessible. One you have to walk down the stream channel maybe a thousand feet, that’s the Ohanui one, unless a new trail is blazed. Not Ohanui, Old Hāmākua one. The Waipiʻo site, the current landowner because the land ownership has changed, the current landowner does not want people on the parcel and correct me if I’m wrong, Mark, but even EMI staff have been threatened on that parcel. I would say of the seven, five are easily accessible but these are still not ADA (Americans with Disability Act) accessible. It’s a fairly narrow road. I could lead a group of five to all of these in half a day if we were diligent about sticking to the task. That is not a hard ask.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"Part of this is building trust and the community having to independently verify has there been compliance. I think it is something worthy to consider, but I also understand liability issues, I understand issues related to size of the group, so some kind of compromise.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"May I speak, Chair Chang to address some of your concerns? Sierra Club has a liability insurance policy.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"Is that to your members, Lucienne?",1,B3,03/19/2024
"It covers anyone on any of our activities so our activities are not limited to our members so this can be considered an official site visit activity. The insurance policy, the liability, is to cover the landowner, not the participants, so the landowners are covered on that liability. The community could agree to limit the number of participants but we would need to make sure that there were people that knew about the various streams that we were visiting. That’s all. These other past visits that we’ve had, we had one visit that was part of a contested case where several community members, like about six, and Mark and one of his staff people and Mike Kido who was a biologist who was looking at the streams went. We had no idea what was being proposed for any of those streams at the time, so you’re not looking at that, you’re just looking at the stream conditions in general. It’s kind of like not on the same topic so this would be the first visit where what is being proposed is being looked at on site at the streams, for the record. I appreciate Ayron’s suggestion and I think it would be very workable.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"I would think a reasonable number of people would be like three or so for one vehicle, passengers, and that sort of thing. It would certainly cut down on the intrusion and be much more easily scheduled. I don’t know, Mark, what you and Sean think about that in terms of group size or Ayron for that inspection?",1,B3,03/19/2024
"I think two vehicles at max, so whatever we can fit into two vehicles.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"There you go, thanks Ayron. That makes good sense to me and I think there ought to be those parameters, they ought to be agreeable. I don’t know if they need the Commission’s intrusive presence on that, but certainly we have some thoughts here that are on the table the Commissioners could deal with.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"I wasn’t around for the EMI decisions, but I think it’s a neat opportunity to change the tenor of what’s been happening on East Maui. Having Ayron there, the things we see in pictures but pointing it out, I know I really valued the crazy day trip out there and being on site. To have Mark and other representatives of the community with Commission staff to explain what’s been done, what’s been planned and actually a large part of it is also in the drive on the way where that dialogue can be outside of the three-minute testimony and hearing space, I think could be very helpful for longer term. I was going to ask Dean about the quarterly meetings, maybe they haven’t been as helpful so this is a complimentary action. I’m kind of hopeful and interested and excited about the possibility of this.",1,B3,03/19/2024
This was requested at the last quarterly meeting. If you look at the tape you will see and frankly I think five people is more practical because you might have a driver of our vehicle who may just be a driver and provide the vehicle.,1,B3,03/19/2024
"I don’t want to get too much into the details, but I do see value and it’s probably helpful maybe for Mark if we gave him cover, that we made it a condition because EMI isn’t the only one where this is going to come up. West Maui, almost wherever we have issues, I think it is helpful seeing the place, having an independent assessment by the community, verify. I think it does move towards trust as well as towards ensuring that there is compliance.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"The decision and order was meant to reconcile a contested case that was dividing our community so we took actions to do that and part of it is what’s happening in the streams with terms to water flow, with respect to infrastructure, but it’s also how we build community. I think you’re spot on in terms of let’s not miss the opportunity to create stronger relationships in managing this very important resource by the many stakeholders who are involved. It’s kind of hard to think about that as a condition, I just wish it would happen. I do get that on one hand, Mark is willing but there may be some other landowners who you need some leverage over and so if our decision helps give you, this is a requirement of the Water Commission for the management of this infrastructure and these streams, then I’m happy to vote for that.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"If I might suggest again Mark and Sean and Ayron as well, an important element here aside from the insurance policy is individual release and indemnities that are absolutely mandatory in this kind of situation for a landowner. Any participants, I would think, would be required and should willingly provide release and indemnities on acceptable form. Shifting gears for a second, Ayron, I’d like to ask under the conditions where the ditch is under a grated intake because you mentioned the rebar and bedrock and the extensive heavy equipment work that might be necessary to remove these. Has it been considered to perhaps deal with these grated entries over the ditch condition being resolved with a steel plate being fabricated which fit and perhaps was attached with bolts that would be perhaps less intrusive, certainly a lot less expensive? I mean moving heavy equipment to jackhammers and demolition equipment into areas like this is first of all it’s very expensive and difficult, but it also does some damage in its own right. Might it not be easier to deal with those conditions? I think there are a few with just a steel plate application.",1,B3,03/19/2024
"Most of these locations are fairly accessible in terms of distance from a drivable, passable road so I think pneumatic drills or whatever could be used. In terms of grates that are flowing over ditches that were acting as stream diversions, I think sealing them whether it’s through concrete or steel plate, I think it might last a little bit longer but that’s up to the applicant. The bigger issue is the concrete walls that dammed up flow to generate the head necessary to get the water into the ditch. In other circumstances, if they are existing on the ditch itself a very careful amount needs to be removed but also not damage the infrastructure. That’s where the applicant is going to do their best to remove as much as possible and we’re comfortable with the amount that they propose to remove. In theory, the entirety of it, but again we understand that there might be some that is not removable simply because it’s integral to the ditch.",1,B3,03/19/2024
I realized it’s a site-specific individual piece by piece analysis but thanks for sharing that.,1,B3,03/19/2024

If a site visit prior to this is going to be able to move things forward in a way that’s going to be more collaborative than between myself and Dr. Strauch and whomever else on the CWRM staff, we’ll arrange something. I apologize for wasting everyone’s time in executive session.",1,B3,03/19/2024

Over the past four years, Mr. Manuel has demonstrated a high level of diligence, commitment, and objective solution-seeking in his oversight of the administration and implementation of the State Water Code and the public trust doctrine. Under his leadership, the Water Commission and its staff have been able to successfully realize the prudent planning and protective mechanisms envisioned in our State Water Code including: • updated instream flow standards for streams throughout East Maui • water management designation for West Maui • updated interim instream flow standard for Heʻeia stream, Oʻahu • updated interim instream flow standard for Waiʻoli stream, Kaua‘i For these reasons, the Sierra Club of Hawai‘i respectfully but strongly urges the Commission to approve the appointment and retention of Marvin Kaleo Manuel as the Deputy Director of CWRM.",1,B1,01/24/2023

As an ‘ohana who relies on the wai and cares for our natural resources, we respect and appreciate and mahalo Kaleo for always being transparent and pono and for genuinely listening to our concerns and for putting our natural resource first. Mahalo nui. Without wai we are nothing. We know this job requires a special and skilled individual, someone who has the knowledge and ability to work effectively and fairly with this community, always putting our natural resources and those who rely on them first and foremost. In my opinion, Kaleo does all of this and much more. Mahalo nui.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"Good afternoon, Chair Chang and members of the Commission, Happy New Year everybody. Nice seeing you and here’s to a good 2023. I’ll keep it short since we all know Kaleo needs to get back to work. You don’t need any encouragement or reminder of how he is objectively truly the best choice for this job. All these supporters and well-wishers, we see how Kaleo as Deputy of the Commission has stepped up its commitment and its progress in fulfilling its public trust kuleana. Of course, credit should go to the Commissioners themselves and all the Commission’s dedicated and hard-working staff, but today is Kaleo’s day. As a decades long advocate for the public trust and an admirer of true public servants, I’m glad that the Commission is keeping the band together here with Kaleo continuing under the new administration. He’s worked hard over the years to grow into this role and we all need him to help lead the Commission in following through on the hard work ahead. Mahalo Kaleo and mahalo Commissioners for voting to confirm. Mahalo.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"Aloha mai everyone. I’m a former eight-year, two-term Water Commissioner and served to the best of my ability with many of you here in this room and a pleasure to meet you Chair and appreciate the work that everyone is doing in this capacity. I’m here to strongly support with the utmost confidence the appointment of Kaleo to continue as Deputy. I think it’s critical to continue the momentum that he has been able to achieve. Kaleo is one of the best facilitators I’ve known. As we all know a positive and important role of this Commission is to have a diversity of opinions and interests and Kaleo does a fantastic job facilitating all of that. I can go over numerous cases and decisions where I felt his leadership was pivotal. To be honest, the last day of my term on the Commission when we released the Nā Wai ‘Ehā decision, Kaleo and I were on the phone multiple times. I think some of us remember there were some challenges or errors in that final Decision and Order and Kaleo was just on it through the whole process. I just want to firmly give my support for his leadership and I want to thank your administration for continuing and seeing his service and where it can take us and water in the future for Hawai‘i. Happy to take any questions.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"Aloha Chair Chang and Commissioners. I’m testifying today in strong support of agenda item B1. Like many of you, I wear lots of different hats in our community and in that capacity, I have had the great privilege of working closely with Deputy Director Manuel on several issues impacting many different islands across our pae ‘āina, but today I am here in my personal capacity. I have been fortunate to have been appearing before this Commission since the 1990s. Yes, I am that old. I was trying to recall how many Deputies I had worked with over the years from Linnel Nishioka, and Yvonne Izu, to Ken Kawahara and more recently Jeff Pearson and then Kaleo. For me, Kaleo stands out as the very best for all the reasons you have already seen detailed in the voluminous written testimony as well as the people who have already appeared today. My voice joins the chorus of others who are deeply grateful that you, Chair Chang, have nominated Deputy Director Manuel to continue the important work of this Commission. Like Wayne Tanaka, I was also at the meeting four years ago supporting Deputy Director Manuel’s first term and I’m excited to be back here again to support him continuing and as someone who tracks water issues closely. I really scrutinized his work over the last four years and have been impressed not simply with his grasp of the issues but by his integrity and aloha and how as a process person he brings so much to this Commission - I think as Commissioner Beamer pointed out. You’ve already heard a lot from folks and as Isaac said we need him to get back to work. I just have a couple of things I’d like to highlight. In his first term he implemented some important changes. I think having issues presented for discussion at one commission meeting and then decision-making at a second meeting has really helped the Commission and all affected stakeholders be able to engage in meaningful discussions without the fear of a contested case hearing hanging over everything. I also got to work closely with him on several issues. One example is our Native Hawaiian and environmental rights clinic supported the Wai‘oli Valley taro hui with challenges to restore their lo‘i kalo and mānowai. This was incredibly important work and incredibly complicated work and you folks know we were working side by side. I cannot say enough about how important Kaleo’s role was as a facilitator to bring together all the different entities, not just with Commission staff, Ayron and others, but also folks throughout DLNR and that was crucial in helping us leverage resources and to make meaningful changes not just with what happened before this Commission but also from a larger policy perspective so that other kalo farmers don’t have to have these issues. Others have also mentioned what an important bridge he’s been and now we can have meaningful two-way discussions not just one way directives. Kaleo has also had the courage to uphold the law and the Commissions processes and that has garnered some grousing, but I think as an attorney, I think that better protects this Commission and has reduced the number of appeals that we’ve seen during his term, at least compared to others. I can go on and on but suffice it to say I think you see I strongly support his reappointment and I want to urge all of you folks to vote in support. Thank you so much and I’m happy to take any questions.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"I have had the privilege of meeting Kaleo as a young undergraduate at the University of Hawai‘i and throughout his graduate studies at UH Mānoa. He took several of my classes and he also joined halau. I’ve never been so proud of him over the past four years and watching him grow under DHHL. He led our PA'I board through an amazing planning process to develop our PA'I strategic plan and watching him facilitate those meetings and watching him in the community, I know that he has done such amazing work in the last four years with his team here. I thank the team here, his staff for the support that they give to Kaleo because a leader can only lead if you have people, and you have staff that strongly support the vision. The fact that he’s holding us all responsible not just the people at the Commission, but to the laws that were put into place to preserve our natural and cultural resources, and water is our most valuable resource. I know that he takes this very seriously and his kuleana to support and abide by and hold up the Water Commission standards and the laws of our ‘āina is going to be something that he takes very seriously, and he also knows that he must answer to his kumu. Thank you very much, I have such strong support for Kaleo. I have gotten to know him, and he is just going to be super for you.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"Aloha I come from Lahaina, Maui. I am just testifying in strong support of Kaleo Manuel to be reappointed to his position as Deputy. Strong kāko‘o to all of the Commissioners of CWRM. We saw him in Lahaina quite a few times especially the past year. I think last spring was when he came out to facilitate a public meeting with all of us. I just really want to commend the awesome work that he did navigating the crowd that we had. He was informing us about the water designation in Lahaina and not pushing any kind of agenda on us but just showing reasons why designation was important and how it could only support the future of Lahaina and how it can help our community as well. Just wanted to quickly testify and show my kāko‘o as a community member of Lahaina for Kaleo Manuel.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"I’m the secretary for the Wai‘oli Valley Taro Hui. Four generations of kalo farmers of Hawai‘i, our organization works in partnership with you and your staff, including Kaleo to amend the IIFS for Wai‘oli Stream in Spring 2021. Our testimony today is in strong support of agenda item B1 and I’m here on behalf of our hui of farmers to support Kaleo because he has supported us after a very long road starting with the 2018 flood. There were tons of applications, exemptions, studies, consultations, time at the Legislature and potential easements. Last year, Chair Case confirmed that we are pau with the water leasing process and can focus all of our efforts back to restoring our farm and we have life in Wai‘oli Valley. It took four years but it felt like a lifetime and we never would have gotten here without the help and support of Kaleo and Ayron. I’m not just talking about the IIFS. Kaleo was an important liaison with the Land Division and DLNR more generally. He was a bridge to ensure clear and transparent communication, a process that was completely confusing for us as kalo farmers. He even came to Wai‘oli to see firsthand the waters and other resources we were talking about and together with Ayron, was key regarding the installation of our gage so we can better monitor both streamflow and water use in our ‘auwais. This is a wonderful example of agency and community working together and this is just one example. I’m sure there are many more across Hawai‘i so please vote to confirm him.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"I’m a Law Student at the William S. Richardson School of Law and given the overwhelming and powerful support already provided, I’ll keep this really short. I’m in strong support of B1 and I will stand on my written testimony. Also wanted to thank Kaleo and the Commission for the ability to testify via Zoom, which makes access to these meetings and information much more open to people who usually have to travel to Honolulu.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"Aloha mai everybody. I’m here to testify in support of the reappointment of Deputy Director Manuel and just wanted to say we have had a lot of positive and very respectful lōkahi and engagement with Deputy Director Manuel. The Honokōhau Valley residents had the opportunity to hike up the valley to see the state of wai as we were renegotiating the IIFS and beginning the conversations in terms of the designation of West Maui. I think it speaks volumes when you have somebody in the Deputy Director’s position to come and walk with the community in their place to sort of really see what the historical impacts are and what other things like developments and other interests have on the ‘āina and on these resources. I would like to see at least one more term from a fellow kanaka and somebody who is truly dedicated to this resource, to our community, to our ‘ohana and hopefully his work and the work that we can do together as a lāhui will benefit the little ones like this and hopefully Deputy Director Manuel, if my boy here needs a job, I hope you can give him one. Mahalo. And I say this in full trust that you will do your best to mālama your kuleana to this next term to ensure the security and integrity of wai for all of us. Mahalo nui.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"I want to support the picking of Kaleo for the position. I met him way back before he worked for the State, and he has always been honest and truthful which is in my experience somewhat rare in government these days. And even when it’s things I don’t want to hear, he tells it to me. I just want to say I support Kaleo and I hope you folks pick him. Thank you.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"Aloha mai kākou. I often appear before you on behalf of various entities, but I am here today solely on my own behalf. Like Professor Sproat and Mr. Moriwake, I’m part of the folks who have been here for three decades. Not only was I here when Kaleo was last appointed, I was also here when the previous Deputy was appointed and the previous Deputy and at one point I was in that seat and the person before that. The thing I wanted to share other than to echo the long support that we’ve heard today for Kaleo is how different it is with respect to those who have come before Commissioners and Deputies. This has been a body that has been deeply hostile to local communities and Hawaiian communities. You have all these voices coming from across the pipeline saying hey, they recognize what you do, and we support what you do, we don’t always agree with what you do but we have a connection now. Not everybody has been happy during Kaleo’s time, but I think that’s also because it’s not that conflict didn’t exist before, but it was suppressed. Voices were suppressed, issues were suppressed, and we know what happens when that happens for too long. Bringing up a process where many entities now feel at least they have the opportunity to come before this really important board and have a fair hearing, will make our lives and Hawai‘i so much better. Mahalo nui.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"I would like to just say mahalo to all of those who have provided written and oral testimony. It is very clear as Mr. Scheuer very aptly stated, things have changed, and it is nice to see these voices at the table. I appreciated reading through all the testimonies as they were individualized based upon a personal experience and I think that really matters. I appreciate everyone who took the time to submit testimony for our consideration, so thank you again.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"I was so happy to hear that Kaleo was coming back. Incoming Chair if you had anything to do with that it was a very wise move. I’m so happy for the Water Commission because Kaleo has done an unbelievable job in managing the Water Commission. I am so happy for the State of Hawai‘i. We’ve heard a lot of descriptions of the last four years, we’ve had an opportunity, maybe for the first time to really implement the Water Code over large regional areas. I am so happy for the State of Hawai‘i that Kaleo is back. Finally, I am so happy for Kaleo himself. He is a unique individual with knowledge, skills and abilities and he has an opportunity to be in a position, which he has demonstrated, over the next four years to make a positive impact and those are experiences and memories that he will always cherish. I am incredibly happy for Kaleo and I am 100% in support of his reappointment.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"Fist of all, I want to thank the testifiers who came forward, took time from your day to be here and be a part of the process and for all that you shared largely in support of Kaleo. I acknowledge the testimony of Charley Ice in opposition and appreciate Charley’s courage and status and stepping forward and stating his views. We’ve heard certainly a strong support from our Hawaiian community and grass roots of our supporters, of our culture and our environment. I also appreciated the testimony of Mike Atherton as a developer who is trying to restore agriculture and other uses in a balanced way, and I think that his testimony was key and an important element of support for your continuation in this position. When Kaleo first came into this position, I met with him in his office and we talk about this all the time, I saw this number on the whiteboard and it was the number of meetings he would have in his term of this Commission and a recognition that every one that passed without productive outcome was a lost opportunity. That is a profoundly important attribute of a public servant who is trying to work especially in this area where so much needs to be done for such a vital resource. That attitude was telltale, and it is one thing to want to get the work done and it is another thing to get the work done. The unprecedented results that we’ve seen in your submittal, Chair, as well as in other testimony, I think testifies to the fact that it’s not only a matter of wishing things can happen but an ability to make things happen. So appreciate that and I love Kevin’s comment that we provided an ear to people who didn’t feel like they had one before and we’ve provided opportunities to really kind of work out the differences so that we have a framework for how to move forward not only to protect the resource, not only to perpetuate the culture, but also to provide for development of agricultural and other urban uses in a way that’s very compatible with those goals and outcomes. That’s balance and I think it’s an important duty of this Commission. I think the team, not only Kaleo, but this team is doing a remarkable job in achieving that. I recognize that as a new administration steps in, there’s a desire to eagerly bring your team in and I appreciate that Governor Green has recognized that some members of the team that came before were really, valuable attributes and deserve recognition for what they’ve done in the past and are going to be valuable in his administration going forward in continuing progress and achieving greater results. For these reasons, I’ve seconded the motion and eagerly await not only the approval of this motion but also the months ahead. I think I have about a year and a half while we continue to work with the work we’ve done. Mahalo.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"It’s with great relief that I heard Deputy Manuel was going to be reappointed. I’m the newest person on the Commission and it was a very eye-opening experience to realize how much of the work of this Commission really happens between the meetings. The Deputy and staff working together to really organize information and provide it to us so that we can make informed decisions. As testifier Kapua Sproat pointed out, the informational briefs that precede decision-making have been really helpful. The submittals are super dense so it’s helpful to have that lead time to wrap our brains around these complicated issues. I’ve had the opportunity to get out to East Maui to walk and really see the area that we are making decisions on. We can’t always go out there, it’s hard logistically with Sunshine Laws but it was facilitated by Deputy and staff. I’ve seen him and a lot of his staff take lead on different issues, Ayron Strauch on streams, Ryan Imata on Red Hill and really take the long view on many things. We’ve had conversations on capacity building, we all know that CWRM doesn’t have enough staff and wanting to do all that it should and wants to do, so how do we take the long view? That’s somebody not looking at a four-year term but really with a long-term kind of intergenerational interest in mind. Alongside with that we’ve had conversations about climate change, how do we better think about climate change in the context of our decision making and that played into the Lahaina Water Management Area Designation. I’m relieved that we can continue the work because these are challenging. As people have noted his facilitation skills are impressive and humbling. I don’t know how to learn those skills or how to create more people who have those skills who can really leverage them in public service. It’s not easy to be an agent of the State especially working in community where there’s been so much distress. I really respect the rapport he’s built especially as I was on the Red Hill permitted interaction group, I’ve seen what happens when we break trust with institutions and how harmful that is when really taking care of our waters. I appreciate the stamina that you bring, and you will find in the coming years. I’m looking forward and I fully support your nomination. I’m looking forward to continuing the important and complicated work ahead.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"I think Kaleo’s accomplishments over his tenure as Deputy have been well documented and described by oral testimony as well as written testimony. I think this is an interesting and unique situation, could you provide some historical perspective? My first question is, I don’t think any agency in the State other than the Water Commission has a Deputy and Chair to be confirmed by two different bodies. How does the relationship work with the Chair being temporary and the Department Deputy being confirmed; should that not run in tandem? But let’s put that aside for a moment, I think it’s a very powerful situation that we have a resident Deputy that’s being nominated again and in reference to Mr. Ice’s testimony, has that been vetted to see if the internal mechanisms of the department have been working as intended? I don’t know if that was ever articulated in the narrative that was presented as well as the resume. All the big stuff for the future I agree with because I was there for most of it. But we do have a fiduciary responsibility to mandate things that we need to interface with the public in terms of well permits or other kinds of administrative things. I was wondering, has that been vetted? That’s sort of my big areas - do we need to talk about it a little more?",1,B1,01/24/2023
"Aloha Commissioner Katayama, mahalo for the question. First of all, I want to say mahalo to the community for support of my nomination as well as the Commissioners and staff that are here. I think the question is tied to that in terms of internal management and staffmanagement and resources. I know what it is like to come in as staff as I used to work for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands as staff and the change in administration every four years and sometimes shorter if they don’t last, so continuity is really important. I will say in my defense, I’ve always come in working within the systems that have been created, but constantly asking questions about efficiency. How can we do things smarter with less resources, take advantage of opportunities when we see them? A lot of the internal dialogues that we have with staff, hopefully eventually some of them will talk with you one on one, or the freedom to do that, and I encourage staff to share their thoughts with me. We’ve constantly had great conversations, we don’t always agree but I’m always willing to listen to staff and look at ways that we can improve our systems. Some of the criticisms in Mr. Ice’s letter I was unaware of. I process permits, well construction and pump installation permits, as they are presented to me and I take every signature I put on a piece of paper very, very seriously. Most of my staff can attest to that as they probably get things sent back to them if there is even just a typo because I want it to be as perfect as it can be. That’s the type of person I am. The commitment to quality, that I’m committed to. I’ve worked with a supervisor and the supervisor would work with me, so we work through some of the issues especially related to well construction/pump installation permits that we’ve reviewed. Again, my commitment is just to be as good as I can, be an open door for staff to work with. As my kumu talked about in her running her halau, you as a leader are only as good as your team. I believe in every single one of my team members and the staff that are here today because I cannot lead without them. They really support me and I actually support them, I’ve uplifted them and a lot of the credit that has been given to me is actually credit that should be given to them because a lot of the initiatives and work that’s been presented, they’ve been worked on but have never gotten to the agenda or have never been prioritized. That’s my response to Commissioner Katayama’s question about a review and analyses of time frames. We were in the middle of a pandemic, I just want to highlight that. I got caught with that one so a lot of the time for review and processing were not only potentially stalled because of the pandemic, staff had retired, other agencies that have to do reviews for example, the Department of Health and State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD) also established new processes that we had to work through and navigate through. While some of the numbers may not line up, I do have data and statistics on permits processed, etc. through my four years. I think a lot of it was just situation based and timing.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"Thank you Kaleo. I guess in going through this process, I believe my fiduciary responsibility is to cover all the bases. All the testimony in support was well deserved.",1,B1,01/24/2023
Mahalo and I appreciate the question and hopefully item C2 will also highlight some of the limits of our resources and the budget and staff that we do have.,1,B1,01/24/2023
"I do have a concern and the concern really is that over many years, I worked on a lot of different teams and a lot of corporate and governmental positions and it’s absolutely critical for the effectiveness for the organizations to have the boss and the assistants to the boss and the Director, Deputy Directors or Deputies to be of one mind and be pulling in the same direction and that usually implies that folks have worked together for some time and they’ve had adequate time and effort devoted to conforming their goals and objectives for the organization and the mission. This is a situation where it appears to me, that we haven’t had that time, unfortunately and that’s the nature of the beast perhaps but we don’t even know for example, if the Chair’s position is final, if that’s correct. I’m concerned about that and this is something that should be discussed in executive session, but that’s a concern because the Chair and the Deputy should be able to finish each other’s sentences. They should have complete agreement, they should really conform the concepts of goals and directions and in a small organization, a relatively small organization like the Commission, that is a big task and shortfalls and budget and in staffing, that’s something that is critical. It’s critical to achieving the correct objectives for the people of Hawai‘i to filling our obligations under the Water Code and I’m just concerned that we haven’t had the time for that conformance and unity of goals and missions and thoughts to take place. I hope it doesn’t appear that there are difference of opinion or things don’t get done as efficiently as possible because that would be unfortunate and again, this is something that we should have talked about in executive session. I really think that we need to make use of that vehicle more often in situations like this. I admire Kaleo, I admire his work and he certainly has a lot of energy and I appreciate and admire that. Thank you very much.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"I’ve only been sitting as Commissioner for 18 months and in that time, I’ve worked with Kaleo, I must say he has a lot of energy and positive energy. He is committed to the mission of the Commission and that is to protect and sustain our resources and our precious water, which I am also committed to. We have some disagreements, we’ve talked about them, and we will continue to work towards the betterment of our State. I am pleased that he has been nominated and fully support his nomination.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"Thank you very much, Kathy, appreciate the comments. I just have a few comments. I appreciated both Mr. Katayama’s and Mr. Meyer’s comments. This is a historic moment for us, one that the Governor has had confidence in nominating me as the first Native Hawaiian woman, with a team with Laura Ka‘akua as the First Deputy and Kaleo Manuel as the Deputy for the Water Commission. I think it is a statement about the Governor’s commitment and his recognition of sensitivity to the Hawaiian community and that we do bring that to a department that touches and concerns every single person, whether you live here or whether you visit, but most particularly Native Hawaiians. You will find that I am a process person and there are people that are far smarter than me on substance, but I am a process person who believes in providing a safe venue and platform for genuine community engagement. I have appreciated the good work of Kaleo, as articulated by many of you who have provided testimony. Sometimes the pendulum swings a bit, and the pendulum has swung a bit where we are creating a platform for voices that historically have not been heard and it is those people who have probably been most affected by the decisions of the Water Commission and other agencies. Both in DLNR and at the Water Commission, it is my intention to create a space for those good conversations. I intend to use the Board of Land & Natural Resources as well as the Water Commission as a vehicle to hear community voices and concerns. We may not all have the same decision, but we are going to try very hard to create a place for those voices to be heard. Our first duty is to the mission of the Water Code. We’re not here to necessarily advocate, but it is to ensure that the Code is being upheld not only in the letter of the law but the spirit of the law. What was it intended to do with respect to my style of management. I say I am much too makule, too old, to micromanage but it is to provide the team, the staff with the tools for them to be successful whether it’s resources, capacity or funding but it is also to provide good input as we all make informed decisions. We are going to do a lot of internal coordination. To Mr. Meyer’s & Mr. Katayama’s comments, we’re going to speak very candidly within these walls, all the divisions will speak, and we have numerous divisions that don’t necessarily have the same mission, but when we leave DLNR we better have one voice but that means that we’re going to have a lot of hard discussions internally. Not everybody agrees with me, and I don’t agree with everybody, but we are going to create an environment where people can feel like they have the ability to say what they have to say and you’re right, I am not confirmed. I am here, I am the interim appointee, subject to Senate confirmation and I don’t know how that’s all going to go but during the time that I have here I am going to make the most of my time here sitting on both the Water Commission and DLNR. And like Kaleo, we come from similar values, and we share similar experiences and I think visions for the implementation of the Water Code. We may not all agree on how we get there but I think we want to get to the right place. I am optimistic that with the Water Commission as a collective body and the good guidance by staff, we will be able to continue the good work that’s already been instituted by the previous Commissioners and the Chairperson. I know that I have big shoes to fill with Suzanne Case but I will do the best that I can. I am extremely grateful that Kaleo has come back to return, that is the Governor’s decision to reappoint Kaleo but I think he has already heard a lot of the people in the community. Mahalo. I’m going to call for the motion that has been made by Commissioner Buck and seconded by Commissioner Hannahs, to approve the recommendation by the Chairperson to appoint Kaleo Manuel as the Deputy Director of the Water Commission, all in favor please say aye. Let’s take a roll call vote for this one to make sure we get it on the record, a unanimous vote. Ms. Yoda will you please do a roll call vote?",1,B1,01/24/2023
"The motion has been made, seconded, and unanimously approved. Congratulations! Mahalo to all of those who are here today and those on Zoom and Kaleo for your willingness to serve another four years.",1,B1,01/24/2023
"Mahalo. My white board is empty so I can put that number on the white board. I appreciate the confidence and again, thank you and mahalo for the support from the community that are here and online as well as staff, mahalo for all that you do and I look forward to another four years.",1,B1,01/24/2023

Commissioners do you have any questions for Dean?,1,B2,08/15/2023
"Before I do, should we hear from the applicant? I have a number of questions... Avery Chumbley’s.",1,B2,08/15/2023
Should I wait till then?,1,B2,08/15/2023
I’m kind of like interested in getting staff’s response to both. Well I’m interested in their response to Avery Chumbley’s letter.,1,B2,08/15/2023
"I’ll just hold off, ok.  What’s staff response to that?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Frankly, I’m not fully aware of what’s going on on the PUC side, even though we did do some coordination or consult with them on West Maui as part of the West Maui designation. As far as Na Wai ‘Eha’s concerned, I think those questions would be best left to Mr. Chumbley and Mr. Geiger.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"All right. With that being said, I think that was Commissioner’s request that we’ll hear from Wesley, the Mundys.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Good morning, Chair and Commission. My name is Wesley Mundy, this is my wife Jodie. We purchased this property close to two years ago and Jodie being from the area, her family’s been on Malaihi Road for about three generations or more. And there’s actually a family lot below us, about a mile that has been engaged in farming activity for that period of time that the family’s been here and as our goal to restore kalo to the area. We remember being up here on this particular lot with regards to taro and agriculture and just being part of this community. Thank you for taking the time to hear us and I’m gonna do our best to answer your questions.",1,B2,08/15/2023
I have a question for them.,1,B2,08/15/2023
"No, please go ahead.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Mr. and Mrs. Mundy, you say you’re going to try to restore. Have you looked and researched the land to see whether it had appurtenant rights because your application says you’re not asking for appurtenant right nor are you asking for traditional and customary rights. Do you know anything about your land? And why didn’t you apply for appurtenant rights if you don’t know that it had water.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"The reason we didn’t apply for appurtenant rights is when you look at the conditions related to this property. When Mr. Chumbley sold the property initially, I believe it’s Mr. Singer, it’s mentioned in there that the appurtenant rights or that service water rights did not transfer. So, it’s my understanding that there we do not have appurtenant rights on this particular property. However, if I’m wrong, I would be very happy to correct that and add that to the application.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Hi, thank you Chair Chang. Avery Chumbley, President of Wailuku Water Company. As a note I've been with the company now 41 years. Chair, before I talk about the B-2 application, I had tried to send a note to the secretary to provide a comment on your C-1 item and I would offer to the Commission, Wailuku Sugar Company has daily rainfall records going back to 1887, which is 136 years of rainfall records across Na Wai ‘Eha from Waihe‘e to Ma‘alaea. And we are more than happy to share that data and that information with the Commission. And we were recently recognized by NOAA and USGS for 125 years of continuous data submission so I offer that up. And I think as Commissioner Hannahs had noted it's important historical information.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Thank you very much Avery. You can send them to Ayron, send them to the Water Commission to...",1,B2,08/15/2023
He already submits them.,1,B2,08/15/2023
"It's not quite that easy. It's in this big book about this thick. So, if you have somebody from UH that can come spend time and convert that into electronic data, I think it's worth your while.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Fair enough, fair enough. Okay, thank you very much you want to comment on B-2?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Yes, I do Chair. Thank you. We've provided detailed testimony, approximately 10 pages, and to put some of this into context I'd like to say this is the first time since June 28, 2021 which is 26 months ago, when the D&O was initially filed that there are SWUPA applications before the Commission for delivery service off of the Wailuku Water Company system. There have been four previous SWUPAs awarded, three of those were directly off of Wailuku River. One of them was directly off of Waihe‘e River. So, this is the first time that SWUPAs have been up for consideration off of the Wailuku system. We take no position on the volume of water sought by the applicant or the proposed allocation in the staff submittals. We do however, have concerns over jurisdictional issues and significant operational issues. Our detailed testimony talks about some of the jurisdictional issues and I'd like to ask our Council Jim Geiger to expand on some of that. They are complex legal issues that I think that this Commission needs to consider before it takes any action today. So, with your consent Chair if Jim could explain some of that.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Yes. Please go ahead, Mr. Geiger.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Thank you, Chair, Commissioners, Avery. We have an issue of concurrent jurisdiction that we're facing with this particular Surface Water Use Application. Wailuku Water Company has a surface water use permit issued by this Commission and we have to follow the terms of that particular permit. In addition, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission because we are a regulated utility. One of the conditions that we have imposed on us by the PUC is that we have to maintain the status quo; we can't take on new customers, we can't change any rates, and we basically can't deliver more than what we are, what we did. So, if this permit is granted without having consulted with the Public Utilities Commission and gotten some agreement and understanding with how their jurisdiction impacts this particular permit, we are faced with either potentially either violating this Commission's directives or violating the Public Utility Commission's directives. And I don't think that the Commission wishes to put anyone, whether it's us or any applicant or any permit holder, in that untenable position. In review of the staff report I noted that there was no indication that the Public Utilities Commission had been contacted even though we were aware that there was a memorandum of understanding between the Commission and the Public Utilities Commission. That was confirmed by Dean's comments or earlier that in fact the staff had not contacted the Public Utilities Commission with regard to Na Wai ‘Eha permits. We think that it would be very important for this permit application as well as future permit applications if that consultation was had and the staff of the Commission as well as the staff of the Public Utilities Commission could meet together with us so that we could determine the best way to handle these types of requests. I don't think anyone wishes people who have an application and rights to receive water be denied water, but at the same time I don't think this Commission or anyone else wants to, by their actions, put a permit holder in violation of another permit or certificate. And so our position on this is that we believe that a short deferral of the application would be appropriate to allow Commission staff, PUC staff, and the company to coordinate as per the memorandum of understanding on how best to handle these type of applications. And if there are any questions, I'll be happy to answer the questions.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Thank you very much, Mr. Geiger for the explanation. Commissioners, do you have any questions? So, I mean what I'm hearing you say Mr. Geiger because I got a copy of an MOA, but it's not signed. Do you know whether this is in effect?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"We do not. We believe that the Commission approved the MOU/MOA, but we have not seen a signed copy either.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Okay, but you're not necessarily suggesting that the MOU prohibits each PUC or CWRM to exercise their own authority, but what you're suggesting is pursuant to the MOU there should be some coordination?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Both pursuant to the MOU and the fact that there is concurrent jurisdiction. In this case, you know, you may have other situations where you have Water Management areas where you do not have a regulated utility. Obviously in that case the concurrent jurisdiction would not come into effect. But in this case because we have a regulated utility in a water management area, both the Public Utilities Commission and this Commission have jurisdiction and we want to make sure that what one board does, does not place a permit holder in jeopardy before the other board.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Okay yeah, I understand what you're saying. Yes, Larry?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"From what I understand, by the way Avery you're looking good after 20 years and I haven't seen you in a while. I know I'm not looking good.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Good to see you, Larry. You still have dark hair, mine's all white.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"I haven't dyed it yet. From what I understand every submittal, there's a direct conflict here. The PUC saying we can't, they can't change any of the water and then we're saying we're going to give it to them if the Commission approves. So I'm sorry, Commissioner Meyer has his hand up.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Oh no, go ahead. I'm sorry, I do have a question for Counsel Geiger. I wanted to ask, it would seem that this has potential to invalidate the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity of the Utilities. Is that in fact the case? Seems contrary to the rules and regulations of that certificate.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"We are concerned that the action that this Commission takes would in fact have an adverse impact on the Certificate of Need and Necessity before the PUC, yes.",1,B2,08/15/2023
That would be my impression as well.,1,B2,08/15/2023
And that's why we think coordination and communication is critical for these permits from this point forward.,1,B2,08/15/2023
"Yeah, I wish I'd had more time in this one to research it myself, but thank you. Chair, I would recommend that we refer this to the AG for further review. I think it's a significant enough issue that the Commission really ought to be on firm ground here, but a deferral for a month would certainly be adequate for researching that question, I would think. Thank you again. I'm sorry to interrupt, Mike and please carry on.",1,B2,08/15/2023
I see Mr. Mundy has his hand up. Did you want to clarify something? Go ahead.,1,B2,08/15/2023
"Well, I just wanted to make a make a point with regards to and to be fair I'm not familiar with the public utilities, the permit and that process, but however from what Mr. Geiger said, things need to be maintained as a status quo with regards to the draw on the water and we're not requesting an additional draw on what's currently flowing. We're just asking to be able to utilize what's already flowing through our property. And put that to proper use as opposed to just going down the drain so to speak. So anyways that's the point I wanted to make.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Mr. and Mrs. Mundy, do you have any objections? Mr. Meyer has suggested a deferral, Commissioner Meyers, based upon...there are other people here who may want to testify, but do you have an objection to a one-month deferral?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"I mean with regards to it being reviewed, Madam Chair. Chair Chang: By the Attorney General, yes.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"I have, I can wait for their response.",1,B2,08/15/2023
Do you have any objections to a one-month deferral?,1,B2,08/15/2023
"At this point, I mean I don't see how one month deferral would necessarily impact our total production. We were hoping to move forward on however, the purpose or the question with the deferral is does it affect their current PUC? And it really, our request shouldn't affect that because we're not asking for an additional draw, we're just asking to utilize the current draw. But in regards or respect to your question, we wouldn't have a problem with the deferral, no. But just as long as, yeah.",1,B2,08/15/2023
Thank you. I appreciate the cooperation. I see Hōkūao’s hand up. Go ahead Hōkūao.,1,B2,08/15/2023
"Aloha Chair Chang, Commissioners. I have a testimony that I wanted to provide, but I’d just like to ask before going into that, that everybody pause on any decision making in regards to this only because the next water use permit application applicant that's coming up is off of the same system. It's a family that has generational ties to Wai‘ehu. Yes, they're utilizing the same system. It's a family that has been waiting for water for a very long time. I'm concerned that any type of deferral, even a month, when the reality of that sometimes can take much longer. That's a family for sure that has been waiting to receive water to restore, not restore, to reopen their lo‘i that have gone dry for some time now. So, I just, I think before any decision, I'd like to see if that next applicant could also be a part of this discussion or at least sharing out that that piece.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Thank you very much, Hōkūao. Is there anybody else? Oh, Mr. Mundy your hand is up.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Apologize and thank you, Hōkūao or Mr. Pellegrino for your insight. We're very familiar with the next applicants. They’re our neighbors who've actually been very helpful to us in understanding some of the history and to my wife, the lineage that their two families actually share. Their grandparents actually farmed the same land together. We found out through conversation and some records and archives and whatnot that my mother-in-law had. But with regards to this, would it be possible to get maybe get in a or maybe with an approval subject to a later review by the PUC be an option also? I just thought I'd present that.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"I want to respond directly to that, but you know Mr., Commissioner Miike had a good number of questions. I want to make sure that we honor your interests.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Yeah. I have several things. By the way Hōkūao how are you doing also? I haven't seen you in a long time. I assume Hōkūao, I'm assuming you're talking about the Ho‘opi‘i application?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"I don't have any concerns over the Ho‘opi‘i one right now on these issues about to raise, but I do have some about the Mundy. According to the application you folks didn't ask for either appurtenant rights or traditional customary rights and yet the Commission staff is suggesting the traditional and customary rights. It's sort of like unique to me that an applicant asks for something and the Commission is going to give them something they didn't ask for. Well, that's one thing. The other thing is that I'm not clear and I'm assuming this is being guided by the contested case which was then issued as a decision in order which according to, I think Avery's thing is on oral arguments in front of the Supreme Court next month and ends in September. But the way that this decision and order is written is not clear to me in terms of traditional and customary rights. First of all, it says that any applicant who qualifies as a Native Hawaiian and who does not intend to grow kalo for commercial purposes qualifies. And then it also says that in the executive summary that an applicant's is separate from the land. So, what I read that is and Julie can answer this, is that mean that any Hawaiian, who can meet the definition of Native Hawaiian in essence, descendants from citizens of the Hawaiian Kingdom, regardless of whether they have a history of traditional and customary rights have now the right? Is that correct Julie?",1,B2,08/15/2023
I'd like to go into executive session to discuss this if you want to.,1,B2,08/15/2023
"Oh, why? I'm just, okay anyway that's one question. The second question of that part is, it looks as though as far as the land it had to have been used according to the decision and order. It had to have been used before 1892 for these kinds of practices. Not a problem with that, but the current Supreme Court decision says that an applicant had to have traditional and customary rights that trace back at least to 1892. And from the decision and order it looks like that no longer is a requirement. Also, in the executive summary says that the statement that it is established that the application of a custom has continued in a particular area. It's ascribed to me, well no, that's a direct quote from PASH. I'm clear and we can go into executive session as Julie suggests. Is that now being, is this decision and order saying that you're breaking away from that? If any Native Hawaiian going into an area that was had traditional and customary practices now has the right and I'm distinguishing between a practice that is traditional and customary versus the right to that practice. Okay, looking back at my, in an executive session I brought along my proposed D&O versus the final D&O and I'll show you what was kept out and what was kept in. Okay, so that's one question I have is that whether we're talking about Mrs. Mundy because her family lived in that area qualifies or whether just because she's Native Hawaiian she qualifies. From what I just heard you say Mr. Mundy, your wife's family has actually been there for a long time and so I just want to know whether they just happen to live in the Na Wai ‘Eha area or whether they were actually living maybe right on the land that you now own and whether your family really can qualify on what the current Supreme Court qualifications are. Okay, the second part is that for 45 years now, the second part is your understanding that your appurtenant rights were extinguished when the land was sold. For 45 years now the Hawaii Constitution said that it preserves appurtenant rights and for 36 years, the Hawaii Water Code has definitely stated that appurtenant rights are preserved and the only difference between riparian rights and appurtenant rights is that riparian rights cannot be severed because a Supreme Court had ruled that they had a statutory basis and that appurtenant rights don't. Well we now have a statutory basis since at least 1987 and a constitutional basis since 1978. And then in the D&O which also was in mine, a decision about a Supreme Court stands and I quote, until the decision has been reversed or overruled by the court of last resort in the Hawaii Supreme Court or there's another issue or altered by legislature in that I addressed the legislator enactment piece in my proposed D&O. That was taken out of the D&O and the conclusion was reached that the Supreme Court has not acted. So, from my standpoint since at least 1987 and probably since 1978 the Supreme Court has already ruled that you cannot sever an appurtenant right anymore. So, what I would say is that if they go through this thing, the Mundys to me, probably can prove, you would have to do this though, that they not only have traditional and customary rights under the current standard, but they also have appurtenant rights under what I say should be the law.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Okay, you want to go into executive session?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"I'm not sure if we're going to go to executive session, but I have just a simple question that's kind of apart from the D&O issues that Commissioner Miike has raised. Mr. Chumbley, what constitutes a customer to you? Are they going to be, what's your criteria and do the Mundys meet that?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Okay yeah, Commissioner Hannahs this is where it gets a little bit difficult over the cross-jurisdictional overlap between the PUC. The original PUC document that we filed along with the amended document, amended application calls for the CPCN [Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity] to be issued as two categories of users. A user was identified as someone who was getting a delivery of water from the Wailuku Water Company system which could mean the kuleana users or any other institutional type users. And then there was the category that we identified as customer which were the individuals under contracts or license agreements. So, in the case of the application, both the users and the customers are generally within the same definition as someone receiving service from the Wailuku Water Company system.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"So, the second part of the PUC order that prohibits you from adding any new customers would apply to users as well?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"We believe it does, yes. Now I would also mention that the risk of a violation of the suspension order with the PUC puts all of the users within Na Wai ‘Eha at risk, not just the Mundys and not just the Ho‘opi‘is. It's everybody because if we are deemed to be in violation of that suspension order, the PUC basically could shut us down. That means no one gets water, including the County of Maui and including all the kuleana users. So, this jurisdictional overlap is something that really needs to be addressed between the Water Commission and the PUC before any new applications are approved that take water out of our system. The four applications that were previously approved since the D&O was issued, were all directly off of the river or the stream, so they had no impact to the Wailuku Water Company system. Now if Mundy and Ho‘opi‘i could take water directly off of North Wai‘ehu stream and not out of our system, it may not be a violation of the suspension order. But we still just don't know that until we have this exchange between the two overlapping jurisdictions.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Or it may be that users don't constitute customers in the PUC's eyes but that needs to be clarified and going back to Mr. Mundy's point, just as an alternative pathway to outright deferral might be a kind of approval subject to receipt of confirmation from the PUC that the action does not constitute a breach of the PUC order that regulates Wailuku operation. I'm not offering that yet but there's a couple of pathways that we have.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"I think Commissioner, you know I don't want to prolong the applicants permits, but I'm concerned that any approval and authorization of a permit today by the Water Commission puts that CPCN at risk. And I don't mean this as a threat, but if a conditional approval or even an outright approval would require me to ask for a contested case. There's too much at risk here. A deferral of 30 to 60 days to work with the PUC and get this resolved is really the right thing to do for B-2 and B-3 applications.",1,B2,08/15/2023
Thank you for your testimony.,1,B2,08/15/2023
"Commissioners, do you have any other questions or is there a motion? I think, yes.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"If we are going to defer it, I would request that of the issues that I raised that the staff, if they are going to continue to recommend, address my issue which is whether they can find out from the Mundys whether they may have T&C rights under the current law and the appurtenant rights, but mainly with T&C law because the way that it's written now, just because the Mundys lived there they were given T&C rights. It's just not, inadequate as far as I'm concerned. So anyway, it will help to clarify as well.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Okay, no I appreciate that.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"So, the deferral, but you really have two purposes: one, to sit with PUC resolve those issues if we can and secondly, have staff sit with the Mundys to review T&C, their rights.",1,B2,08/15/2023
And clarify because it's very fuzzy right now.,1,B2,08/15/2023
"Chair, has the issue with, related TNC use for home-use only been clarified? What can you do with any surplus production?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Kaleo, I don't. My understanding is under Article 12 Section 7. We are obligated as a Water Commission to ensure that traditional customary practices are preserved and protected. So, there is a separate analysis that goes into all of the Water Commission action to do a separate traditional customary practice analysis and that is one to ensure that. And I mean I too I have a little, maybe I disagree with a little some of our analysis, but essentially the analysis is to determine does the applicant’s proposed use have an impact on traditional customary practices? Now in this case the applicant may actually be a practitioner who's entitled to separate rights, but I think our analysis as a Commission is to determine that the action that's before us, is our action granting this permit going to impact traditional customary practices? This one, the analysis is on the applicant and I don't really think that that's the appropriate analysis. I think the analysis is identify what the traditional customary practice is or what the resources are, two what impact does the proposed action have on traditional customary practices, and then three the mitigation. But in this particular process we are treating, we're determining whether the applicant has traditional customary practices. That to me is an independent, I mean they either have it or they don't, but that's not the analysis that we go through. To me that shouldn't be the analysis and because you know the burden. And we're using a Hanapī, that was a criminal action where the burden shifted. The burden shifted because Hanapī utilized traditional customary practices as a defense to criminal trespass. So, the court says that in the context of criminal trespass the burden shifts to, in that case, Mr. Hanapī, but in the case of us in a civil action the burden is ours or the burden is the applicants. I shouldn't say the burden. The burden is the applicants to demonstrate that their actions will not impact traditional customary practices. I'm sorry, that’s a long-winded kind of explanation.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"So, are we clear on the path that we’re taking?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"All I'm saying is that, I agree with all that. All I'm saying though is that it was the staff that took on the burden of which is the applicant’s to prove that they have traditional and customary rights. If it's Mundy, I don't have any problem with the staff helping them on that, but what I don't understand is that the way that the decision and order on the Nā Wai ‘Ehā cases, it's so general that I have no idea what they're talking about to satisfy being a traditional and customary practice which has a right to it.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Yeah and I guess I, look at now. Commissioner Hannahs: Mr. Mundy, Mr. Mundy.",1,B2,08/15/2023
I mean I'm going to take first Mr. Mundy and then I'm going to take Hōkūao. Go ahead Mr. Mundy. You have a question?,1,B2,08/15/2023
"Thank you, Chair. No, I wanted to just address the question of why we didn't put in, go for Hawaiian rights and again appurtenant rights which I explained why we didn’t look at that initially. And with regards to the Hawaiian rights, this being our first process of doing an application like this after the application was submitted, we had learned about those options and we were told that this forum here would be an opportunity to bring that up and to talk about it more. So obviously we're more than happy to abide by what the process is and to add what needs to be done. So just wanted to make sure we answered that question.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Because you said, Mrs. Mundy, is it your grandfather or grandmother they are related to the Ho‘opi‘is who are from the area?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"No, they're very close friends.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Oh, close friends okay.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Yes, and they worked at the farm, the taro farm before.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"But you are not from, are you from this ahupua‘a? Are you from this area? Jodie Mundy: Yes, I am. I was brought up here.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Do you know whether your family also grew taro in this area? Jodie Mundy: Yes, yes.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Okay, okay. So, I think the point that we're trying to make is you may have the right to continue to exercise traditional customary practices independent of any appurtenant rights. Your rights run with the land as someone who has a lineal connection to that place through your ‘ohana, that you have independently traditional customary practices that you can assert which is the forms of basis for why you have the right to use water. Which is a little different from appurtenant rights or one that comes with, I mean you have an inherent right as someone if you can show that your ‘ohana did practice there. Hōkūao, did you want to say something?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Yes, you know whether there's going to be a deferral or not, I just wanted to be on record to at least provide a little bit of our testimony in support of the Mundys and the requests for kuleana water regarding their Surface Water Use Permit. The use that they are requesting is in direct alignment with the work of our organization and you know while the staff support and recommending this approval of the water use permit is now on the table, we just would like to thank the staff for the work, the Water Commission staff for their initial support. And if the Mundys need any assistance in working on their appurtenant rights requests or just any kind of information in regards to their lineal and cultural ties to Wai‘ehu. Hui o Nā Wai ʻEhā is there to support them and happy to work with them to ensure that they are receiving the type of support on all levels. So, Hui o Nā Wai ʻEhā is again in support of their water use permit application. Mahalo.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Thank you for that offer, that's very kind of you. Do I have a...Commissioners, do you have any other questions or a motion?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"I have just a reflection of what I'm hearing. It sounds like the applicant and staff have to kind of revisit the application given the additional knowledge they now have. The staff have some homework to reach out to PUC to clarify and make sure that what we're doing doesn't create more tangles and that you had a request on the Ka Pa‘akai analysis part of it, as well. So, staff have two assignments or three assignments. The applicants have another assignment. Is that, am I getting that correct?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"I think so. I mean I will tell you I am, I need to have a better understanding and maybe I think Julie suggested we go into executive session, but what the impact of this MOU. Because I cannot imagine PUC asserting jurisdiction over, I mean we have to be able to work independently so. But what I'm hearing you guys tell us both Mr. Geiger and Mr. Chumbley is that the difference is it's how the water is being taken out of the system. If the Mundys would be taking water directly out of the stream as part of their traditional customary practice that's different versus they're taking it out of your system, is that correct? And the fact that they're taking it out of your system is what triggers the PUC and that order? Okay, okay. Hōkūao, do you have a clarification on that?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Yeah, I do want to make one point is that although the source of water for these two applicants are coming from Wailuku Water Company’s system, you know first and foremost that you know the original intakes and the po‘owai for these users were likely obliterated at the time of plantation which forced them to connect to these systems, but secondly the ‘auwai system that flows to these particular properties, both including the Mundy’s and Ho‘opi‘i’s and others’ below them, is actually the traditional system. A good portion of it is the traditional system. So, you know I want to make note that while maybe the intake and the source now currently comes from the Waihe‘e Ditch, the system that flows forth is still very much part of that original traditional infrastructure. And so again I don't know if that has any play in all of this, but I think that's important to note that not the entire infrastructure is not necessarily Wailuku Water Company, but the intake portion is, which has, you know, they don't have any other choice to be connected to that system. Mahalo.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"It does seem like there's a factual question and then there's a legal question. Do I have a, Kaleo, do you have a recommendation? Oh Mr. Mundy, your hand is up.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Thank you, Chair. Just and again just to point out with regards to the draw on the water. We're not asking to be an additional draw on the ditch. This water is already flowing and is already servicing farmers below us and we're just asking to be able to use what's currently flowing through. And as far as being a customer I guess that would come under the decision of the PUC, but with regards to the actual use and the impact on the system we're not looking to be an additional impact on the system. It's already flowing and with regards to, as I understand the Ho‘opi‘is and not to speak for them in any way shape or form, but just to point out when you walk the Waihe‘e Ditch which flows behind our property you can see that the mechanisms for distribution still exist just at some point in time they were damaged, not repaired. And so this kuleana water flowing from you know a source up in the mountains doesn't start at the Waihe‘e Ditch. It starts at another location as Mr. Pellegrino pointed out. So, and again our intent is not to be an additional impact on Mr. Chumbley's operation, it's just to currently use what's already flowing through the area. Thank you again.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Thank you. Kaleo, did you want to make a recommendation or?",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Yeah. Hearing what’s said, I think maybe to clarify the MOU with PUC and our staff conversations with their council as well as their staff. The MOU really was about consultation and data exchange and as part of this process as we're getting through and issuing new Surface Water Use Permits or going through that process, there are rules right? We have to put a public notice out. During that period that's when we expect these comments to come out. Unfortunately, for various reasons people don't always participate in that set time period and it comes up at these meetings before we get testimony or these concerns. So totally hear Wailuku Water and Commissions concerns. Similarly, we can reach out to PUC more directly per the MOU agreement and then we can coordinate that or at least ask them for their comments and their feedback on this and try to bring it back in a timely manner. So, I'm not against deferral to provide more facts and data to you folks so you feel comfortable making any decisions. I don't, I'll ask Dean, maybe Dean has any comments as well as staff that's going to have to work on this. But I guess pre- deferral or even pre-executive session if that's where you folks decide to go, you might want to take up B-3 as well since Ms. Ho‘opi‘i is here, but in the waiting room and maybe have that deferral one time. I don't know if that's an option.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Yeah, I'm open to that if the, I mean is the Commission, are you open to that option? You know we'd put this in advance here B-3? Yeah, yeah because they seem to be similarly situated.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"I just wanna, since she's here, give her the opportunity. Chair Chang: Yes, yes, yes.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"I'm assuming the similar testimony from Avery and folks as well as Hōkūao would apply to B-3 also. Just want to make sure we get that on the record if there is a deferral, so there's direct items to staff on what those follow ups are going to be.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Right, right. Very good. I mean I think that's efficient. I respect consistency.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Okay, hang on. So, Mr. Mundy, we're going to hold your item. We're going to hear from Mrs. Ho‘opi‘i and then we're going to try to make a ruling on both, okay? So just hang on tight.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Thank you very much and likewise Mr. Chumbley, Mr. Geiger, and Mr. Pellegrino because I suspect it's the same so just hold on tight. Go ahead, Dean.",1,B2,08/15/2023
"Informational Briefing on Well Construction and Pump Installation Permits PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Ryan Imata, CWRM Hydrologic Program Manager",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Staff provided a thorough overview of the current permitting process for well construction and pump installation. He expounded on the application review process, post-construction review process, and possible next steps.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"In your existing process, what you've covered to date the process, there is no public review?",0,C4,11/21/2023
"We publish it in our bulletin and anybody that inquiries about it can have our application and look at it and provide comments to us, but we don't write letters to anyone specifically in the public unless there are certain conditions. No, I can't think of any conditions that require us to, I mean it's just very specific people that we might ask questions of.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"So, there's no opportunity for public? I think that that was part of the comment that was raised on Hāpuna and that's part of my concern too is just this, a delegation that doesn't provide opportunities for public oversight. That's why I wanted this to come back to this Commission.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"What I was going to say was that the wells are published in our bulletin and anyone that has our bulletin is aware of wells that are on our application, that we're looking at the time.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Looking at your list of agencies that you sent, there's a letter from Kali Watson from DHHL saying that they’d like earlier review. You don't automatically send DHHL any of these reports?",0,C4,11/21/2023
We don't send them applications for wells. We do send DHHL all water use permit applications.,0,C4,11/21/2023
"It would be a simple matter just to include them in that list though, right?",0,C4,11/21/2023
It's just putting them on our header and then having our secretary email it to them for comments.,0,C4,11/21/2023
"Now in non-water management areas, once you approve this permit they can go ahead and pump up to the capacity of the well?",0,C4,11/21/2023
You'll see as we go through the review process if we do approve the pump capacity then they can pump up to the capacity of the pump.,0,C4,11/21/2023
"I have a little problem with that. As long as it's well within the sustainable yield of an aquifer, you routinely approve these or do you match that to what they claim they're going to use it for? I come in and say I want five million gallons. Do they have to provide a justification for the amount for the capacity?",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Good question. In a non-management area no, you don't need to justify the use as reasonable and beneficial; however, we do look at the pump capacity with respect to a couple of things. We look to see if the total MGD is within the sustainable yield and again remember that delegation of authority is only for wells that are in aquifers that reported pumpage is below 70% of sustainable yield. So, somebody can't just come in. I'll give you a good example, Mahi Pono came in for an application and this is where I said we have that provision for pump replacements where we're exempt from getting a permit from our office. But I have a problem with that because now Mahi Pono wants to put in pumps that would far exceed the sustainable yield of Pāʻia, so no. I think that you're absolutely spot on. If the pump capacity shows that it's going to exceed sustainable yield, I think we have to present it to the Commission.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"That's not my issue. My issue is that even if it's well within the sustainable yield, if someone comes in for five million or some large amount I would think that they'd have to justify why they're asking for such a large amount. I can see an exemption for a homeowner with a home well but someone could come in for such a large amount and we don't do any review of why they're asking for it, I really have problems with that.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"As we go through, there’s one thing that will address your concern. The other thing is Kaleo has been very mindful about looking at our applications and saying, hey this quantity doesn't seem appropriate for what they're proposing to do. So, we go back and we ask and then we will present it to you guys if we need to in that case.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"The code and the definition of wells talks about that wells are supposed to be evaluated for reasonable, beneficial. It doesn't say whether in or outside of management area and so as Ryan said oftentimes in our review or at least my review when an applicant checks what they've planned to use the well for, there are some basic categories and some estimated end-use based on pump capacity. Oftentimes your pump capacity is usually larger than what you anticipate your end-use being and in that analysis we get really good at understanding standards and comparing it to water system standards of the county or what this Commission has already approved in prior decision making as it relates to reasonable, beneficial. Staff as well as I have already put on those goggles, basically your goggles that on prior decisions, for example 2,500 gallons per acre per day for ag. In scenarios like that if those numbers are way off as Ryan said historically or at least in the years that I've been here, I've challenged staff to ask the applicant are you being efficient? Why is this number so high? If there's uncertainty or concern, I've always proposed to bring it to the Commission because it's something beyond the normal routine. Again, based on internal staff review and our expertise as staff. I will say as Ryan is going to get to it, a majority of the well applications that we do receive are small capacity, almost domestic wells where there isn't service by other large public water systems. Taking on the kuleana of owning and operating a well is a big one and costs a lot of money not only in the initial investment but also long-term operation and management. It's a long-winded answer. I think if we can get through the presentation and highlight all the stats then you can start to ask additional questions. The concept of five million we haven't seen, I haven't seen one well come across my desk for five million. A lot of times it's pump replacements for these shafts that are causing us pause, but all of those as Ryan talked about, we are wanting to bring back to the Commission because those are old. The shafts don't meet standards today. They were done before the code adopted these standards. All of these things brought together, we want to make sure that the Commission is aware of their obligation to protect the resource and also ensure that it meets reasonable, beneficial use standards. I would just suggest if we can get through it, I think it'll help inform the dialogue at the end.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"I wanted to provide some context. The reason why I asked for this informational briefing is one, I also sit as the chair of the board of Land and Natural Resources. There's a lot of delegation that comes, but it always is to the chairperson. I had asked the staff to provide me background information. I said and this was in light of Commissioner Katayama's inquiry about ministerial versus discretionary so they provided me the 1997. This was the delegation authority and for me times have changed since 1997 and even in DLNR we do annual delegations. The different divisions will come to the board every year asking for a delegation to approve exemptions for EAs or things like that, so I felt very uncomfortable with a 1997 delegation. I also felt that that should be to the chairperson unless there's something specifically in writing from the chairperson to the deputy. Similarly, I also felt that I really wanted the Water Commission to vet this out because a lot has changed since 1997, Ka Paʻakai expectations by community, the more information we're realizing about the interaction between groundwater and surface water that I thought that this required a much broader dialogue with the Commission. And as Ryan said a lot of the permits that they're getting is Hawaiian Paradise and maybe that's an exception, but I thought it was still worthy for this Commission to have that discussion and then revisit the question of is it appropriate for delegation, do you want everything to come to the Commission or are there certain things that you're willing to delegate? At Hāpuna there were some members of the community who raised the whole question about the delegation and the well permit approval process so that's the backdrop of why this is coming. There's no decision today. Ryan, thank you for the comprehensive overview of your process and the considerations.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"I'm pretty satisfied with the explanation. I think since it's such an old policy that you question, I think you should bring a recommendation to us about what you should do about it.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"The types of permits that are being delegated, I don’t have a...",0,C4,11/21/2023
"The difference between ministerial versus discretionary because Ryan, I know that that was Commissioner Katayama’s. You just have a total number of permits or do you have a separation of the types of permits?",0,C4,11/21/2023
"I kind of thought that that question was going to be asked. I can tell you just sort of anecdotally. I don't have statistics but I can tell you that you are seeing the ones that are in management area areas already which are not a lot. You can imagine water management areas they're pretty much tapped out, so we don't bring that many applications to you. Most of the applications that we do bring to you that are in that are for wells and pumps are also accompanied by a water use permit would be in Wailua and Mokuleʻia as groundwater management areas. I'd say about 50 to 60% is Hawaiian Paradise Park with another 10 or 15% being the Navy monitor wells. Aside from that, there are wells going in in Maui but again now Lahaina is a designated management area. You're going to see all of those. We do get a handful of wells on Kauaʻi which maybe you're not going to see. I think that most of those are small residential wells, too. If they're not in compliance with the standards, we bring them to you, too. I guess the question is what's the breakdown of the ones that you don't see? If the question is what's the breakdown of...",0,C4,11/21/2023
A breakdown of all of the well permits.,0,C4,11/21/2023
"I would say maybe 70% is little individual domestic wells. You get maybe about 10% of wells that might be for systems like Kāʻū Pūlehu. You are getting maybe about 10 or 15% and maybe more now that the Board is looking for alternative supplies of municipal wells and then another 10, 15, 20% of Navy monitor wells. I don't know if that added up to 100%.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"If I can Chair, what we can do is we can get the specifics in writing. We have that data, we have WRIMS which is our Water Resource Information Management System and we can populate those reports, instead of these round numbers. I think the purpose of this presentation is very high-level focus on delegation, but if we can provide the specific permit amounts per island, types of uses we can do that analysis and provide that in writing in a future submittal.",0,C4,11/21/2023
As part of that recommendation.,0,C4,11/21/2023
"Yeah, as part of the recommendation. What I think I'm going to ask and help facilitate this conversation is based on what's presented, what feels right, what doesn't feel right, what are thresholds that you want us to consider and bring for the recommendations, what are you comfortable with, what are you not comfortable with. Again, as Ryan has said and I will speak for myself in this process. I've come into this as an appointed deputy operating under the practice that has existed since 1997 and prior and so now that there's a desire to revisit and evaluate this process it would help us to understand what is it that you want us to focus on and then bring back to you folks recommendation. If you can gear your dialogue to that, that would help us frame the recommendation that we bring forward in a future submittal.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"I have a comment and a question. I came onto this Commission on the sort of tail end of the Ota Well discussions and I saw some of the contention around that because it's my understanding that well construction permits don't necessarily require Ka Paʻakai analysis and I think that was what came up at the last meeting. Ryan or Deputy Manuel, can you confirm or explain is Ka Paʻakai analysis part of a well construction permit generally in or outside of a water management area? Because you referred to it as part of the case law, but I didn't see it as part of the regular process of a well construction permit.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Part of the reason why I presented that was because of the Chair's request and the comments that Ka Paʻakai, times are different from 1997 to today. What I will say is that yes, Ka Paʻakai is required in groundwater management areas and that's what I present to you when I present you well pumps and water use permits. Specifically for Ota Well it was required as that was part of the denial of the designation of Keauhou, was a requirement to make sure that that was addressed. I will say and I don't know if this is correct, but for wells that are in compliance with the standards and where we have assessed that a pump test shows no impacts then no, we don't require Ka Paʻakai analysis.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Let me just add on very clearly the Ka Paʻakai as we've discussed and as Chair made a priority in her coming into this agency is the kuleana of the applicant. The application does not ask the three questions or Ka Paʻakai analysis is not asked of the applicant currently on well construction permits. Very simplistically I think Ryan highlighted in our review process if there's areas via Kīpuka or even in staff review that we've known, there's been issues with practitioners or we know there's an existence of resources then we ask the applicant to go through that extra analysis. Again, that is discretionary and staff have used that judgment right now. Currently in the application there is no Ka Paʻakai that's required.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"And it is my legal position. I believe Ka Paʻakai applies to everything so long as there is a potential impact. Now the analysis may vary depending upon the scope, but I do believe one still has to do the analysis and I do believe the burden is on the applicant. If the applicant does not provide us sufficient information I believe then it is our constitutional obligation to say we're going to deny your permit because you haven't given us sufficient information to do the analysis. But I also think government agencies have not been very clear with applicants on what those expectations are. I think we are trying as we move forward to make that very clear and I think Kaleo and his staff have done a very good job of elevating Ka Paʻakai. I think that's where I saw somewhat of an inconsistency on these well permits. Some places maybe it's a subdivision where we've got other Ka Paʻakai analysis. I think we should be able to look at some of those as well, but nonetheless I think we still have to do the analysis.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Thank you, Ryan for the analysis. The genesis for my question was one, are we consistent? Do we have a standard that we request of all well applicants? And two, is there an area if there are special conditions and where the proposed drilling takes place, not post-drilling but for review prior to the drilling? For example, in the Keauhou the issue was that aquifer may be under pressure so is the engineering and the process sufficient to handle any issues arising from something like that? I guess internally if it's addressed properly in the application maybe it should be handled within the department; however, I am very sympathetic to a very efficient and orderly processing of applications and it should not be extraordinarily cumbersome as long as we feel that we're protecting the aquifer. In today's conversation with the Navy they asked on the status of the three applications they have within your department. From my perspective, are we being most efficient, are we being most consistent, and are we ensuring that we're protecting the aquifer under some unusual situations. I know that you've articulated the 70% rule but are there any other special considerations that should be disclosed prior to drilling?",0,C4,11/21/2023
Can I build on that? I appreciate that point. In the commercial world we call it the customer discovery. How do people look upon this? Is it onerous? Is it impeding not only creating inefficiencies but impeding things that we want to have happen in our world that are good things: agricultural projects and sustainable food systems and so forth? What's broken about that that we can and should fix without compromising our mandates and obligations on our part for the resource?,0,C4,11/21/2023
"I think since Kaleo has been here he's been very good about moving forward things where he feels like we need to be efficient and that we don't need to put like super deep scrutiny into. For example, I'm talking about the Hawaiian Paradise Park wells. They're such small capacity pumps. The sustainable yield is so high and you know Kaleo just kind of lets those things, how do I say this he allows us to be efficient in approving those things, whereas I think where things have a deeper cause for concern Kaleo goes back and forth with us. I don't know how he has the energy to do it and to put the scrutiny on every application, but Kaleo definitely does. Why are they using this much, what are they doing this, why are they identifying this water level? I do think that right now we are pretty efficient in the way that we get things out. Again, I am severely understaffed in Groundwater Regulation Branch, that's why you heard the Navy asking where are those three wells and we are understaffed and we haven't been getting things out as quick as we can which is why I'm kind of an advocate for efficiency while also recognizing that we do need to address the concerns that the Commission brings up and to bring focus into those things that you guys think are important which is why we're reaching out today so that we can get the best feedback from you to make a recommendation.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Just so I can speak for myself, thanks Ryan. Like I've said in most public settings and I'll tell everyone is I take every signature seriously, having had signed permits. I review every single permit that comes across my desk similarly. You kind of catch up and you learn about where the hot spots are throughout the state and where you spend your resources and time with the limited resources we have. The identification of HPP, what you do see is this huge influx of permits because people just want water security. This is a rural subdivision in the middle of Puna oftentimes below poverty level that are really just trying to make sure that they have water for their own uses. When you look at that as a public trust use of water within the context of available yield, all of these factors get factored into at least staff's analysis and our analysis. Getting to your point about what parts of the system do we really and where we should be focusing on, we really need, if we're going to get into even further analysis which I think is fair and which is within the context of our constitutional obligation we need more resources. Staff are not going to be able to process permits, bring it to this Commission, and also build capacity if Ka Paʻakai is going to be the questions that are added to the permit application. It will backlog the industry. The industry itself has been built up around a process that has been in existence since 1997, so if this is an additional requirement I will say it will backlog the industry and based on my review of current industry consultants and what they're producing related specifically to well construction permits. I will say we do need to revisit this with our attorney generals who have looked at often times this delegation of authority as almost a ministerial process versus a discretionary process and there's as a discretionary permit, there's additional triggers that happen. The instant requirement for 343. If everything is truly discretionary then everything triggers. Every permit, every use of water triggers 343. Right now that isn't the case for private wells on private property, at least that's the interpretation and analysis that staff have gone through. There are these implications as we go through this process and hearing Chair's concern about this dated delegation, I also share that we definitely want to revisit where it makes sense for us to manage our resources and also manage expectations on process because if including public participation, if we're going to provide even beyond the bulletin a venue for people to opine and comment on wells, it will prolong the process. It's just part of the reality of process and all of these things have push and pull points that this body obviously should consider in its decision making. I think we as staff, we're here to present what we're working with and what we have to deal with in a public, transparent process and then have real conversations about what are the next steps and what are the implications of those next steps.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"I appreciate that. For me sitting both as Land Board and as chair of the CWRM, there's a heightened scrutiny upon us. There are competing interests, we have demand for housing and then we have watershed protection, we have traditional customary practices. I want to avoid, I want to minimize the risk for delays through litigation and contested case hearings and I'm all about process, an open process. I'm not necessarily advocating we're going to separate community meetings because I do not think that that is our kuleana as well, but I think the process through our CWRM Commission meetings provides a public platform for communities to be engaged either through informational meetings or through decision making. I do believe that we do need to have some criteria and I would just like the criteria to be vetted and that it's presented so we can get public comments. No we don't think you should be, that shouldn't be delegated or no, you should. To me, that's the cover that we need or that I need in particular as we're making decisions is that there's an opportunity for people to provide some input. At the end of the day we will proceed, but it is very difficult to manage competing needs, higher public expectation and I'm trying to find the path forward through both transparency but yet efficiency.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"I wonder if there's a lesson learned from item B-2 on the agenda of training and maybe that's videotape so we don't have to invest the human capital in doing it all the time. Where people who are ready to apply go through some kind of, here's what we're looking for, here's what's going to happen so you can anticipate the questions in order to provide the information that'll make this most efficient. If we cue them to the answers to the test, then it'll help them expedite the process. We don’t have to put it all on us.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"We need to provide them the tools, but I think it's also if an application is not complete then it is not an application in our process. I think we get criticized including the State Historic Preservation division for sitting on things too long, but I think it's because what's coming to us isn't complete. We have to have the courage to say, “you know what, this is not a complete application. These are the things that are expected and you haven't included the Ka Paʻakai analysis, therefore it's not complete. Please do this and then come back when you're...”",0,C4,11/21/2023
"I would have big problems if everybody had to meet the Ka Paʻakai analysis. There is a provision in the code about de minimis effect and so we should look at that as one way of avoiding having every little household do a Ka Paʻakai because if you do the Ka Paʻakai, that standard says ‘we don't know’ is not an answer.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"In my mind it's a constitutional obligation beyond the code, so even if the code may have a separate standard. Again I also don't think if there are numerous houses in the same subdivision that are looking for a permit, there's no reason we cannot rely upon other similarly situated information, historic information, moʻolelo, streams that go through there, other kinds should be similar. I think that there are other ways to address that. CWRM can make our applications public. If you’ve got a well that you want to do, permit right next to this house, look at the application that's already been submitted. I don't think it has to be onerous, I think people think it's onerous, but I don't think it has to be as onerous as a perception.",0,C4,11/21/2023
I think it’s onerous.,0,C4,11/21/2023
"I have a thought and since I'm in a public hearing I just want to put it out there. It's probably a 10-year data compilation project for somebody but to be able to have a map and to say ‘I want to put a well in this location. Whoa, there's some interesting, confined aquifers,’ and suddenly it triggers. Okay, if you're in this region because it has this geology, here are the things you're going to need to do. Sorry, this is not more work for you, Ryan without five more people but maybe somebody in the audience will take this idea and run with it. I think we all want to know what documents, what historic reports for a certain area you people should be referencing. If it is Kepa Manley’s report, here. We don't want to have to nag an applicant and it should be easy for them to piggy-back on the work that's already done. I have a thought going back to the main objective about delegation. It makes sense for me to not have staff, Deputy, Chair shoulder the responsibility for certain items that may be high risk or need to be in a public form. I don't know what those criteria are but between now and when this becomes an action item, I think this is a good start, wells in management area aquifers where conditions are established by the Commission. Being more specific about those regions maybe on a shape file, unusual hydrogeology, because that's going to apply to where wells have evidence of impacts to streams and then that's the same with it doesn't matter if it's maximum pump capacity or confined aquifer that's going to leak. We have to think about, again, the potential impacts due to human variables of construction and also the environmental variables and historical variables because some areas are going to be more sensitive to others or have more active practice. I think we can sit down with some maps and try and get some teeth around that.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Can I respond to your two points because I think they're spot on. The conversation about this map has been, at least since I've started in this water industry, has been the talk of the town. Everybody's wanting the cheat sheet to get to the finish line. The challenge is and what the constitutional courts have said consistently is T&C are very specific and site based and practice based, so when you start to create these kinds of maps that articulate, “oh this is what happens in certain areas,” it meets portions of the constitutional obligation in some context but it's not the end all be all. It creates this cheat sheet that oftentimes people feel like it's the bar that needs to be set but the challenge is the bar is a lot higher, at least that's what the courts have said. It's very specific and there are also concerns about sharing a lot of that data and information with certain practices in certain communities which was the case in the Ota well when we went or at least when I went out and discussed stuff with community. That's a challenge staff have articulated that it shouldn't necessarily, consistent with Commissioner Miike, be if you're an individual just trying to get a well and having to go through this additional analysis. People don't know where to go, they don't know, what do you mean Ka Paʻakai? Then they have to understand what Ka Paʻakai means and their constitutional obligation as citizens in the state of Hawaii. A lot of people don't get that and so there is this capacity that we're talking about that to be honest doesn't exist except within very small circles within the state and it's a huge ramp up that we're going to have to work towards. I'm not saying that it's not required and something we shouldn't be doing but it's just part of the reality when you ask people Ka Paʻakai, they have no clue. It is something that we need to do. I do want to get a feel for the group, what I'm hearing is adding Ka Paʻakai to the application. If that is something that we're going to recommend, then we need to modify applications and set that expectation from the beginning. That's a huge shift from the current practice and so we'll obviously check with AG's and work with Chair but the feeling from the body is we need guidance. If that is something that you, this body, believes is a requirement to put in a well and a pump, that's something we can pursue and we're open to that dialogue but that's currently not what we're doing and we really need guidance from you folks on this if this is something you want to do because I think that'll set the tone and the shift in the current practice.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Can I clarify that's not necessarily what I mean but there should be a flag if you're going to work in a certain area to do more and it doesn't need to require disclosure of sensitive information, but there should be a flag to say look closer.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"SHPD, they have but it is TMK specific. You could go to...I know that Leo Asuncion was working on, OPSD, so there would be different layers of different kinds of whether it would be different kinds of sensitivities or zoning. I think there was an attempt and quite frankly that was the one of the purposes of the ʻAha Moku Council, was to design sort of this overlay not necessarily of specific practices but to say ʻohan from here, if you're going to do anything here you should talk to these people or there would be sort of bubbles of sensitive area, talk to community. It was not in some way to reveal confidential, ʻohana secrets but at least put people on awareness. Because true, if we're going to require this we better give people the tools, the access where to get it. There's a lot of people who have good intentions but they just don't know where. There's a transition period that we have to go through, we cannot start from tomorrow, everybody got to do this. But I think we do have to start elevating what the expectations are and get guidance.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"This is a pretty large issue, way beyond the duties of CWRM, but I guess the general disposition I have is not to lower the bar but to really as you said, raise the bar and give people resources so they can achieve that. It occurs to me that as those applications come in, we will become the repository for some really valuable information and making that an accessible repository with guardrails. Like Papakilo database, you can go do your genealogy there, you don't have to give it to them. They help you do it and then you make the decision whether you want to disclose. I think we should always honor that kind of choice and control and so forth but to the extent people wish to share, then we start to create rather than have all this wonderful information sit in the file of well permits. Let's bring it into an accessible database that then helps other people with their future well permits.",0,C4,11/21/2023
I'd have to go back and look at Ka Paʻakai again but I I'm not sure it applies to each and every situation. It seems to me that it cannot apply to absolutely everything we do. It's an impossible burden to overcome.,0,C4,11/21/2023
"You're right, no you're right. It is case by case, but I think we have to at least embark on that analysis. I think just to develop criteria saying, okay these things it won't apply to something as very small as if it could be a well permit that happens to go right next to this stream or this trail. That small well may make a difference, so I think that I always think in my mind whenever I'm looking at a project, is there a stream that passes by? Are there trails? Are there native plants? There may be certain kinds of triggers that one may think are a minimal impact, but I agree it is case by case.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Your example, I'm at a loss to see how your ordinary person can overcome that burden by saying there is no impact. Maybe I don't know who can do that, I doubt whether CWRM can do that. I guess one of the issues for the Attorney General is does Ka Paʻakai apply to absolutely everything we do or are there others? It’s a very heavy burden for an applicant to have to meet that.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"But it's mitigation. You could have an adverse impact but you have reasonable mitigation. It may be monetary, it may be creating a buffer. I think Ka Paʻakai does require some analysis to determine if there's an adverse impact or potential. What are reasonable mitigation measures? To me that's all that the court is asking us.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"But the court is asking that you show positively that there is no impact or if there is an impact, what are you going to do about it? That's why I think it's an insurmountable burden to a small person just wanting to put something towards their own homestead.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Fair enough, fair enough.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Maybe because there's public here and it's almost 6, if you want to do testimony and then we can continue the conversation.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"Three parts in three minutes. Slide number 10: I want to just bring to your attention I thought that was really great that CWRM staff held public hearings. Just to reiterate public hearing community input is important. I do have an issue as you all mentioned during the course of this conversation with community outreach being that only through subscription to bulletin is community able to know what's going on with these well permits. I just want to reiterate that and then maybe listen to your conversation, categories how you said individuals versus ʻohana and also / is on Homestead / is it business or commercial for-profit. Case in point that the question mentioned about 5-million-gallon request and then the response about usually it's in small capacity; however, I want to reiterate it was said that Mahi Pono applied for permit or permits that went and go beyond the sustainable yields. Yes, it is important to be very vigilant about that and to summarize the second part with and reemphasize slides 30 and 31. 30 is the Ka Paʻakai slides. 30 and 31 with the Ka Paʻakai and 31 and regarding Waiāhole and the public trust. I thought that was really important to reemphasize and then slide 32 Molokaʻi about the precautionary principle. The three points on page 32 was really important to really reemphasize that. Actually it's on page 33 that again not affecting kanaka maoli rights and just to err on the side of precaution without the need to prove scientifically. Again reiterate slide 32 and just to end with this, that I do hope that CWRM does listen as you're saying right before I testified and make decisions from public community input rather than just coming with preconceived personal decisions already to make within the board. On the previous one I testified and then you're kind of ready just to pass it so I really do hope that this process is based off of again the public input that you may hear that day and then also decide to whether defer or postpone and again to really listen to the public. Public input is really important and that ending with public trust purposes having priority over private commercial uses, this being for water, ʻāina and everything. I just wanted to bring that to reemphasize those points again.",0,C4,11/21/2023
"For the record my name is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer. I'm here on behalf of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. You have our written testimony, I'd like to expand a little bit upon it and also just draw some points that have arisen in the discussion. First of all I really want to thank you, Chair Chang for bringing this. This is actually one of the most important issues you've brought in front of this Commission or has been in front of this Commission for many years and I really thought it was an excellent presentation by Ryan. This has been something that has been a long-standing issue for the Commission particularly because there's been a mismatch between, as the Waiāhole case, one of the quotes Ryan didn't bring up that your responsibility to protect public trust issues applies to old waters without exception or distinction. It's not just in designated areas that you have a kuleana, but you've only had a real tool because of this delegation of authority to protect public trust interests in water and public trust uses of water in designated water management areas because of this delegation. The presentation was excellent again particularly including the administrative history. Some of those decisions are not online and so it's actually been years of trying to find out when was this delegated, what exactly was delegated. It's really good and this is something that I and others for DHHL and for others have asked about and commented on for many years. I want to now move on to expand on to the discussion of delegation and how the public is informed that you raised Chair Chang because that was typically the answer that when we ask we said, well how do we find out about this? The response is, okay well it's in the bulletin. I read the bulletin every month, I'm probably one of the few people who do. But I just want to highlight for you some of the characteristics of the bulletin. It's not entirely clear in the section in the bulletin on well construction and pump installation permits, what's included and what's not. There are things in there that have been in there literally for decades and there's other things that if they appear at all, appear very limited. The way the bulletin is presented you can't actually download the data easily and put into a spreadsheet so you have to manually go through. I just want to highlight for you one particular thing about public notice, presumably the 90-day approval deadline when it appears in the bulletin and then there's 90 days, that's presumably the public’s chance to comment. I printed out this month's bulletin and if you can see the yellow highlighting, you don't have approval dates on everyone but there were 30 instances in which the approval for the wells were issued prior to the 90-day deadline occurring. Before the comment period ended the wells were approved. There's actually one well in the Kahului aquifer by King's Cathedral where it's listed and maybe it's an error in the bulletin, but the application was approved before the application was filed.",0,C4,11/21/2023
I'm sure that was a mistake.,0,C4,11/21/2023
"There's a number in which the letter of assurance appeared before the application was filed, so I'm not sure that it's necessarily a mistake. Just to highlight that this isn't just unusual necessarily to this bulletin. When I was before you not speaking on behalf of DHHL at your September meeting but with concerns about the Hāpuna aquifer, I referenced the Kaloko deep monitoring well on Hinalani Street. Now this was a well in which the Water Commission was the applicant as well as the approving entity for the well construction and pump installation permit and if you recall that well was specifically designed to try and discover deep confined groundwater below salt water. It did so but it's pierced that aquifer boundary and for months now it's not been sealed and that water has been wasted, gushing out of that well. In that particular case the well construction and pump installation permit for that particular well appeared in the bulletin only after the application was accepted as complete. A letter of assurance was issued to the driller, the 90-day common period expired, and the permit was already approved and it just appeared once in the bulletin. There was no chance at all for the public to comment on how that is and I don't believe that's unique to this. Public notice under the existing scheme is significantly lacking. This also is significant when you relate in terms of public trust uses and there was some discussion of the use of public pump tests in how we might evaluate the impact on a stream or on an ankle line pool or a nearshore ecosystem. Pump tests under the existing rules go somewhere between three and I think at the longest five days. Let me just be really clear, that's not going to be sufficient in the vast majority of cases to identify any hydrological impact on a public trust resource. It will happen, it might happen over months or years but when you draw water out of the ground it's not for free. Eventually that water that you're taking out of the ground is not flowing to the coast or not flowing to a stream or not flowing to some groundwater dependent ecosystem. The pump tests are designed to see whether or not that particular well can sustain that level of pumping and they do that well but they are not designed nor do they run in a way that can identify impacts to public trust uses. The other important thing and we talk about well, is the pumping near sustainable yield. The impact on a particular public trust use whether it is a limu bed or a fish pond or a stream resource, actually an individual wells impact on that public trust use of water will have nothing to do with whether or not you're at near sustainable yield. You could have a sustainable yield of hundreds of millions of gallons a day, but if you put in a big well right next to the resource you're trying to protect, it will be impacted. Conversely you could have a very small sustainable yield and you could be pumping over sustainable yield, but if it's very, very far away from that resource that you're trying to protect the impacts that you'll see will be minuscule to none over any meaningful time period. Impacts happen to these resources based on the location of the well, the depth of the well, and the pumping level but not at all in relationship to what the sustainable yield is of the aquifer. The consequences of all this for DHHL’s beneficiaries one, is that there's some significant inequity. For our beneficiaries and others, if you happen to live in a designated area you get to find out who's pumping in your area and a meaningful chance to comment and see whether or not your rights as a DHHL beneficiary to a public trust use of water are impacted. If you're not under the existing scheme you're completely disadvantaged even if you manage to catch in the bulletin and you manage to send your comments in prior to the approval. There's no obligation under the existing practice for the Commission to even respond and there is certainly no due process available to DHHL or the beneficiaries in practice. I'll just also highlight for you this desire to be able to meaningfully comment and change and challenge particular land uses is what has driven designation processes around the state because it's been the only way that people can be involved. For these reasons again, really grateful for you bringing this up. It is a really critical and important issue for the management of water. It helps you solve some of the issues you have in terms of your mismatch between what your kuleana, responsibilities are versus the rights you have to implement it and DHHL is particularly and its beneficiaries are particularly impacted because we have reservations around the state that outside of designated management areas, people are impacting them but our ability to protect our reservation rights are very limited. I'd be more than happy to answer any questions. Mahalo nui.",0,C4,11/21/2023

"Most immediately I would suggest, Commissioner Hannahs for wells that are for domestic uses that are in line with the county's level of proposed domestic guidelines, so between 400 and 600 gallons per day would seem to me to be, with a very few exceptions are you’re next to a fish pond or something like that.

"The public notification, hearing the concern we've been working internally with staff and on our admin rules for example, on maybe strategies to address the concern about not being notified or not knowing if a well permit comes in. I think one of the draft rules that we're looking at is a well goes in that you're required to notify your adjacent land owners, just TMK adjacent, just be a good neighbor as part of the notification requirement so your neighbor would know, hey if you're putting in a well and I have a well at least I have a chance to determine whether it's impacting me. Or if I have T&C on my property, I want to know if it's going to actually dry up my loʻi or something like that. Those are other strategies that we're looking at pursuing through rulemaking to address some of the concerns about public notice. Hearing the concerns, we can also strategize and think of other ways to be more transparent and provide public opportunity. Just a question for the body right now, there's this transition period and context, currently there's delegation to chair to approve permits and there's quite a backlog of permits that are sitting on our desk right now for review and approval. I hear the urgency to bring something back or we are going to feel the pressure and get phone calls, Ryan and the team, where's my permit? Where's my permit?

"Modification of Existing Delegation to the Chairperson, Dated December 19, 2023, to Approve Certain Well Construction and Pump Installation Permits by Limiting the Delegation to Certain Circumstances When the Well is in Compliance with the Hawai‘i Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards and for Pumps Less than 27 Gallons Per Minute and Delegation to the Deputy Director for Other Groundwater Permit-Related Approvals Including Acceptance of Applications for Initial Review, Permit Extensions, and Well Completion Reports and Certificates.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Ryan Imata, Groundwater Regulation Branch Chief",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Staff recommended revisions to the delegations to approve well and pump permits, set by the Commission at its December 19, 2023 meeting, after the Commission’s directive to consult with the Departments of Water Supply.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Just to summarize then, basically any household domestic wells are below the line. That's why you picked the 27 (gallons per minute), right?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"And second, even if the delegation is given, in individual cases, that still comes to the Commission. When for example, what you're talking about, there’s a cross between aquifers and surface water, etc. It's not an absolute delegation, it's sort of a routine delegation with exceptions, which when things arise on a particular application.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Yeah, I was trying to identify any permits in the 27 years that I've been here, looking at where I think that there are going to be concerns. I would love to focus more of our effort on where I think that there are potentials for impacts to other resources or other users or traditional and customary practices or whatever. I think this is a good balance between filtering out things like individual domestic uses where the use is so small, relative to sustainable yield, but bringing to you the issues that are much bigger.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Thanks, Ryan, for this. I’m trying to read the esoteric document that is the Hawaiʻi Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards. I notice it was revised in 2004, but that's not referenced. You told us about the establishment in 1997, is there anything to note about that 2004 revision? I'm just going to say approval by the chairperson was noted about 40 times, so there was a lot of delegation already in that document. Can you kind of explain?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I can't speak to the specifics of the differences between the 1997 and 2004 standards, but I know at the time that we first implemented the standards, we were having a lot of comments from drillers and developers and I think just the general public about things that needed clarification. I don't think the 2004 standards necessarily revised anything from a policy procedural standpoint, I think it was more details about construction, construction details that were amended. The delegations in and of themselves were kind of a clarification of the more routine things that we do, and not specifically permit delegations. I hope that answers your question.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Not quite how I read it, but I'm not a lawyer. The second question I had was around recommendation one. Ota Well was just on our radar, so I was going back and recalling that there were eight alternative actions for Keauhou non-designation and the first of those was, “the Commission will refer all well permit applications to ʻAha Moku.” There's a clearly delineated process and so how would this proposed recommendation - I mean it doesn't seem to address that there are specific, close-to-designation areas that may be important for us to consider or for there to be a public process on. One, because it's already established that for Keauhou, there is a need to address the well construction or it says, “all permits.” How are we folding that in? I was going to suggest an amendment there, but how are you considering the regional specifics?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"That's a good question. Here is the thing about Keauhou, and I can't tell you the answer to this, but I think there have been some statements, specific to Ota Well, that there was nothing in the eight requirements that required us to bring it to the Commission. But in my recommendation, I think where the Chair feels that there are things that the Chair wants to make sure that there's public disclosure on and the opportunity for public input on, we can take it to the Commission. Basically, what I'm proposing is not saying that everything blanket, gets delegated to the Chair. There are opportunities and I think Keauhou is one of them where the Chair can take the approval of the well permit and/or the pump permit to the Commission. Again, it's just very specific to the area, but like I said, I think most of the concerns related to the quantity of water and the potential for threats are first covered by the fact that most of those areas are designated Water Management Areas, so all of those are going to come to the Commission anyway.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Sorry, what I was referring to was places that are maybe near to designation or not designated. Just for the record I'll refer to February 14, 2017 - eight criteria were proposed as following actions as alternatives to designation. “The Commission will refer all well permit applications to the ʻAha Moku system for review and recommendations to protect traditional and customary practices that are exercised and may be affected by the proposed application. If traditional and customary practices are found in the proposed permit area that may be affected by the proposed action, special conditions will be suggested to mitigate the impact of proposal. If the well operator and land owner do not agree, then the staff will present applications to the Commission for decision making pursuant to HRS 174C-84(f) and HAR §13-168-12(h).” I guess I just want to understand if we decide this, how do these two sort of decisions - just put like some address that there are certain areas that we will need to have more discretion on and not leave it up to the Chair who comes and goes and may or may not know about certain hotpots.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I do see what you're saying in terms of, does this delegation supersede that. We can maybe add in some language in there to say that this doesn't supersede areas where there are the Commission imposed requirements for things to come to the Commission. I agree.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I have a question about the delegation. I understand that the proposal is to delegate to the Chair, I understand that. My question is, is this ministerial versus rulemaking? So it's a legal question. The other question I have, along the lines of what Aurora was mentioning which is, is there a certain criteria that is part of the recommendation for the Chair to make that determination as to what comes to the Commission? For the Department of Health, we have a statute that says if it is in the public interest to bring something to require a public hearing, the director may require a public hearing on a permit issue and in the statute itself it sets forth some criteria. It's a legal issue, I think, but I'm wondering how we would address that?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"No, go ahead. I'm not the attorney here. COMMISSIONER HO: In this case, I'm not either.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"And I'm not rendering a legal opinion either, but quite frankly that's why I brought this to the Commission in December 2023 because I just felt that in light of the comments that we were receiving- and this came up in Hāpuna about traditional and customary practices, 343, that there seemed to be a question as to, shouldn't this be a matter that's really brought before the Water Commission? Not just delegated to the Chairperson. I think staff has tried to attempt to craft exceptions. I don't know if I would necessarily say it's ministerial because there are discretionary provisions that may be triggered. I think Aurora's comment is a really good one that there should be maybe a 1C that says something recognizing that where there are Commission decisions or determinations, that does not waive the Commission's right to oversee this. So something to that effect because I too, I felt really uncomfortable with this sort of unlimited delegation and that was more because I wasn't as familiar. I also thought that there are some things that should be brought out to the larger public. I think Ryan is talking also about the Ka Paʻakai Analysis, having greater guidance that can provide staff the opportunity. Also the public website - creating an opportunity where everybody can see all applications. Now whether that at least provides another opportunity for the public to know what permits the Commission may be looking at or the staff may be looking at. Balancing that against looking at all of the testimony that came primarily from the water departments, recognizing we've got to find a balance between how do we facilitate some of these smaller requests versus how do we differentiate those that do require greater review in a public forum by the Water Commission.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I was just going to ask, historically, how have we handled all of these delegations? Has it been rulemaking or has it been ministerial?",1,B2,06/18/2024
It's been through board action. The board has authorized... COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: So we are consistent with this action today?,1,B2,06/18/2024
"Yes, I'm assuming that previously they were consulting with the Attorney General's office and the delegation was not rulemaking. I will say for the Land Board as well, there’s a lot of just delegating to the Chairperson to negotiate a contract or 343. I don't believe this is rulemaking.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I think the delegation itself is one action and I don't think that is rulemaking. I think we have the authority to delegate to you and that's not rulemaking. It's maybe some other aspects of it which is what criteria, and there's a body of cases which is why I thought it is a legal call, but there are a body of cases where internally the police department or an agency can set forth different criteria and that is not considered rulemaking. I just didn't know where we sit. The delegation I'm clear about, but where we sit on some other aspects of this request like 27 gallons per minute, like when the Chair is able to decide what should go to the greater Commission, those kinds of things. There are cases that address this which I'm just not familiar with.",1,B2,06/18/2024
Are you suggesting that we also seek Deputy Attorney General counsel on this before we take an action? Or Colin?,1,B2,06/18/2024
Let me ask the question another way. Are you okay with the recommendations that are explicitly stated here that there are delegations subject to certain exceptions?,1,B2,06/18/2024
"I'm okay with the delegation itself. I think we can delegate to the Chair, I'm okay with that. It's the exceptions that I'm on the fence on whether we have the authority on the exceptions or do we have to do something more. In my former life, I remember that body of cases, I'm just not as familiar with that line of cases at this point and what I don't want us to do is to act on something and then get...",1,B2,06/18/2024
"So it's not the fact that we’re making these exceptions, it's the fact how we do it, how we implement that.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"And whether we have the authority versus rulemaking. I'm just interested if to see if the staff has researched this, if our attorney general has some thought on this.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I think that's a valid question regarding whether the Chairperson, in its discretion to say, oh no I don't think this is of public interest, I'm not going to you know. I understand.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I really don't like what's happening here which is we're starting to get into such details of a delegation that it's going to be meaningless. The other thing is that I don't know of any bar that says we have to, if we're going to delegate, we have to delegate absolutely. We're only talking about delegating part of a decision making or a way of looking at things. I think it's irrelevant that we have to carve out exceptions and then we have to maybe look at rulemaking when we talk about delegation. When we want to delegate, we're going to delegate and I don't see any problems with delegating authority. Again, as I say, I'm concerned if we get into too much detail about what we're delegating, I'm fine with the language here and from the presentation that was given, the explanation is satisfactory to me.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Let me ask you, Ryan, did you consult with the Attorney General's office on this matter?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"No, but, Colin, I think you guys did review the submittal and I was trying to make sure that anything that was delegated wasn't - how do I say this? The delegation is for approval, so there's some discretion in what's delegated, but I was trying to take out the discretion so that I was being very specific about which things get delegated. Again, I can't comment on the legality of that, but I think if the Commission approved the specificity with which things have to go back to the Commission...I wasn't aware that that was a legal issue.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I'm here, thank you. Good morning Chair, aloha Commissioners. For the record my name is Roy Hardy, formerly Groundwater Protection manager for the Water Commission. I didn't really want to get into too much detail. I know I only got three minutes, but I was very happy to hear the discussion that the Commission was going through primarily about the issue of is this rulemaking or not. Just a little bit of background of some of the statements that were made and questions that were asked. Kagawa-Viviani brought up, I didn't even know, 40 times that delegation was mentioned in the 2004 Hawaiʻi Construction Standards. The 1997 and 2004 updates, there was a lot of public information meetings, meetings with the public, meetings with all the drillers. There were presentations at conferences all about these things and there was a lot of input. These took years to arrive at, these details, there are a lot of them, very complex. Some of the examples I was reading through in the submittal about this cross connection issue, it sounds like it's something new, it isn't. It's addressed already in the construction standards. Saltwater wells need to be solid casing all the way down to saltwater and grouted all the way through the freshwater to protect the basal aquifer. Similarly, if there's cross connections with perched aquifers while you're going down the fine basal aquifers, that needs to be closed off and those are in the sections of casing and grouting, as well. I was a little bit scratching my head on that, but all these details aside, it seems like and I was happy to hear this thing - is this rulemaking- because this is going to affect everyone, especially when you're delegating with these exceptions. The first exception I can tell you - 1A, wells that penetrate to discrete water bodies. That happens a lot everywhere, almost. Almost all the wells on Kauaʻi that happens, it's an old island so there's a lot of layers of low permeability where you run through and there are a lot of perched aquifers, confined aquifers. In East Maui, there's lots of perched aquifers. On the Big Island, Keauhou, there's lots as well. Overall, this seems like if you're going to make these kind of distinctions and exceptions, it really sounds more like an update to the Construction Standards themselves. If that's what's being sought here, if there's special cases so kind of a rulemaking thing. I would agree with what was discussed that maybe the AG should weigh in, sorry Colin, about whether this approach really is rulemaking.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani brought up Keauhou and all these conditions. Well, that's a special case because of the non-designation, so that's not really rulemaking. I think the first condition she read out was this collaborating, talking with ʻAha Moku and bringing construction permits and pump installation permits in the non-designated area if conditions that were discussed were not agreeable to the applicant. You actually had an example of that and that's why that special condition was put into the non-designation proceedings and accepted by the Commission of the Kohanaiki project which is right next door to the national park. Just through the regular process, the delegated process and discussing the applications, what came to be agreed upon by all the parties was, hey, put in these monitor wells, three monitor wells. They were put in and they're there and I think they've provided very good information which actually helped with the designation proceedings, as well. That was just codifying that special situation in Keauhou and especially with the interest in designation. I don't think that's a rule, it's just, here's this special place that there's a lot of concern and able to arrive at reasonable accommodations and conditions with the applicants and the people of that place. Again, I think my time is used up here but I do like the question - is this overall approach rulemaking or not? That's kind of my question, thank you.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Aloha Commissioners, Andrew Choy with the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL). The Department appreciates the opportunity to provide testimony on these items or this particular agenda item. First off, the Department was not consulted on this matter. We appreciate the importance the role that the Department of Water Supply’s have in water development and delivery in Hawaiʻi and are glad that they were considered. The Department is both a water purveyor and public trust use of water, we however, were not consulted. We were aware of the agenda item when the agenda was posted and had access to the submittal on Monday which was also our Commission meeting. As Ryan acknowledged in his presentation, he did reach out to Dr. Scheuer over the weekend, but it wasn't really sufficient time for us to really digest this submittal and process its implications on the Department's ability to provide water to its beneficiaries. CWRM staff conversely worked hand-in-hand with us well over a month on another agenda item on your agenda today, so it can be done to reach out to the Department in advance, well in advance of this presentation. Also, secondly on transparency for DHHL and other public trust users and the general public is still an issue. We appreciate that the submittal raises the importance of public information and transparency, however the recommended action especially to the extent that expanded areas of delegation to the chair depend on notice in the water resource bulletin, I think Ryan also acknowledged maybe posting these applications online. That is a good solution, but I think other solutions for transparency can also be explored, as well. Delegation removes due process for the expanded areas for delegation, well construction permits, certain pump installation permits. This will remove due process for the Department and its beneficiaries in all instances except when we are the applicant. Cumulative impacts are not addressed. While exempting some small domestic wells can make sense, even in those cases the cumulative impacts of multiple wells should somehow be addressed. This could be significant adverse impact to the Department and other public trust uses of water. Efficiency is a worthy goal, but the submittal lacks some quantification of the problem and proposed solution. For instance, it could talk about how many of these permits come before staff each year over maybe the last 5 years and if this action were to be approved by the Commission, what the expectation on the time to process the permits. What is the difference in time, how much time do we hope to save by this. I don't think that was clearly communicated so I don't know the extent of the issue based on what was presented and whether or not this is an adequate solution to address the issue. The Department does suggest deferral of this matter until these issues would allow for further review and analysis by the Commission and its staff, however we understand that there are other differences of perspective and discussion among Commission as well as other public testimony. In the absence of a deferral, some of the Department's concerns could be addressed by modifying proposed action to add an ‘F’ to the A - E list of pump installation permits that are not delegated as follows. By adding an item F, pumps in aquifers where the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands has a water reservation, we would like to see added as one of the exceptions, should a deferral not happen today. Thank you again for the time to testify and if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Thank you, Andrew. I appreciate your recommendation. You indicated that there may be other methods of notice. Did you have another suggestion?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I think posting it online, posting it in the water bulletin, those are good first steps. I think other methods could be the environmental notice. I think that receives a greater deal of circulation availability. Posting it in the newspaper, public notice, taking out an ad in the Ka Wai Ola newsletter that OHA (Office of Hawaiian Affairs) produces, another form. I do think there are other ways to get the word out and be more transparent, but those are just some recommendations off the top of my head.",1,B2,06/18/2024
Thank you very much for that.,1,B2,06/18/2024
"Thank you. You make a good point that presumably, we're doing this to make the process more efficient, but that really hasn't been explained and addressed in the report. For Ryan, perhaps, to respond. If something has to come to the Commission, what's the typical time frame for approval versus if we delegate this? How efficient would the system be? Can you help us understand the benefit as to what we gain from delegation?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I can tell you that our statutory deadline for approval of permits is 90 days, regardless of whether it comes to the Commission or whether it's delegated approval to the Chair. The problem with bringing all applications to the Commission is we have to take the time to draft the submittal and prepare all of the documentation for wells that comply with the well standards. I think that that would increase our processing time and it has increased our processing time quite significantly. I'm going to add to and I don't know that this is necessarily pertaining to the delegation in and of itself, but groundwater regulation branch is severely understaffed at this point. For the amount of things that we are tasked with right now, which includes the newly designated Lahaina and potentially Waiʻanae designation, in addition to now having to bring all well permits to the Commission. It not only adds a time component to our ability to process, it takes away our ability to really focus our efforts on areas where I think that there are significant concerns and significant potential impacts to resources including traditional and customary practices. I'll identify two of them. One of them is in the north sector of Oʻahu where there are really a lot of concerns about these large residential units on agricultural land coming up. I think that's something that we need to focus our efforts on to bring to you guys so that decisions can be made in a more open and meaningful way. The other one is out in Kūkiʻo on the Big Island where we have a brackish lens that we do have concerns about the lens potentially becoming saltier. Those are areas that I want to focus our efforts on to make sure that we're providing the adequate protection. Every time I bring a Hawaiian Paradise Park well to you for approval that is like 0.005% of sustainable yield, takes away the ability for Groundwater Regulation Branch to focus on things that are more important. So there's not only the time commitment, there's also the ability for us to focus our efforts where I think that there are concerns.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Point taken. Thank you, Ryan.",1,B2,06/18/2024
If I remember correctly this issue came up because Chair was concerned about an open-ended delegation and this is an attempt to restrict the delegation. What's happened in the past? I don't know of anything that's happened in the past that the old system of delegation was leading to some problems. All I hear now is people are concerned about because it's been brought out in the open that we want to sort of restrict the delegation. It seems backwards that here we are trying to restrict the delegation and people are concerned about how we're restricting the delegation where in the past it's been an open-ended delegation.,1,B2,06/18/2024
"Another question. Along those lines, Ryan, you mentioned that we have 90 or that you have 90 days to issue a permit. Is the consequence if you don't issue the permit within 90 days, it will be deemed approved or what is it? I know there's a statute.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I've been reading a lot of your guys’ rules, the Department of Health rules lately and I noticed that there is an automatic approval if something isn't reviewed and approved within a statutory deadline. We don't have any of that in the HRS or the HAR so the read from our AG's office, and again I don't know if... The answer from our Deputy AGs has been that automatic approval isn't done because of lack of adherence to that 90-day statutory deadline.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"So what's the consequence, Ryan, if you don't approve it in 90 days? RYAN IMATA: There is no consequence.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I just wondered why, I wondered why you said you had to approve it within 90 days. I thought there was a consequence.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"As much as possible, we try to follow the law. I mean that's our job is to make sure that we follow the law. Unfortunately, again with the change in delegation and a lot of the changes that are happening, I don't think it's stated enough to the Commission that Groundwater Branch has extreme challenges with getting things done. I’m looking at who is here to testify, I see Barry is here. I know that there's been a lot of push back, there have been a lot of people that call me that you guys aren't aware about that are pretty upset about the process taking so long and how this delegation adds to that concern for time. On the one hand, I do understand the ability to provide an opportunity for public input, I respect the fact that there are changes that have happened since 1997, but I'm looking at it from the perspective of trying to make sure that I focus the things that you guys need to see and the important issues and taking away the things that I think are much more routine and ministerial in terms of people complying with those and not needing to go to you guys for approval. That's all my concern is.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Ryan, I believe at one time you did some statistics. What is a total number of Well Construction and Pump Installation permits and because I think hearing Andrew's comments about...so what's the issue you have? You're saying that there's so many permits and that you're not able to dedicate the time to the harder issues. So out of the total permits, how many permits would fall under this number one where it meets the standards? Because you had given to me some statistics on Hawaiian Paradise that you said something like over 50% of all the well permits come from Hawaii Paradise. Am I making that up or is that true?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"No, that's very true and in fact, ‘Iwalani or Dean, can you allow me to share screen because I can't share screen right now. Still can’t. Okay, here we go. While the discussion was going on, I just did a super quick report from our database about well applications that we've gotten I think since 2019. From 2019 to today, we had, I don't have a summary number, but it looks like we got about 700 applications which amounts to about a 100 per year. If you look at the aquifer codes, a lot of these are for domestic wells in Hawaiian Paradise Park. Look at the aquifer code 80801, I think 80801 is Pāhoa, Hawaiian Paradise Park, most of them. If you look at all of the pages, I have like 18 pages. I think over half of them are in Hawaiian Paradise Park, so you're right and here you didn't make that up, 50% is about right. Some of them are in Maui, this is aquifer code 6. These are on Oʻahu, 3. And again, these Oʻahu applications some of them are individual domestic, but some of them require water use permits. These are Navy monitor wells which they're constantly pushing us on and we try to address those because we know that those are necessary to really address the needs of analyzing data around the Red Hill spill. Then there's a lot of Board of Water Supply wells and Barry Usagawa is here from the Board to kind of talk about the time frame that we've been faced with trying to get these approved for them, too. Again, these are sorted by aquifer codes. Freeing up our ability by delegating all of the Hawaiian Paradise Park wells will really significantly impact our time. Again, we have other challenges, we have staffing issues, we have designation issues, we have a lot of other issues so I'm not saying that this is a blanket fix all that's going to allow us to get permits out way, way faster, but it's another layer that impacts our ability to get work done. I hope that answered your question.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Good morning, Chair and Commissioners, I guess I'll go first. We submitted testimony in support of the staff recommendations primarily because of the streamlining, just the well construction permit and administrative tax that are related as practical for administrative expedience. We make four points, one is that the staff is very knowledgeable and experienced and capable and under the direction of the director and the deputy working as a team, they determine all the conditions. Certainly the delays have been affecting our projects. It's been at least a year on a couple of them. Even delegated, I might point out that the staff still have to send the permit applications around for agency review and comment and that does take a while, in particular the State Historic Preservation Division. And while those delays are affecting us and it does affect the availability of water for affordable housing and it just exacerbates our water shortage potential from contamination, climate change, induced drought, and wildfires. The third point is that we are aware and bear the risk of the drilling of the exploratory well whether we can find a competent source of water, so we aware of those risks and also that conditions will be placed on these permits. Primarily in Oʻahu, you have like three bites of the apple actually because it's designated except for Waiʻanae, and we're working on a petition to designate Waiʻanae. But delegating the well construction permit allows us to find a competent source to the well testing, developing the information that could be then used to determine the pump installation permit, the sizing, and of course the water use permit. Those two other permits go before the Commission, so in terms of transparency in public notice, there are two other layers or two other types of processes that will do that. In particular for us to drill an exploratory well, Chapter 343, Section 5, when you use State or County funds or lands, we are required to do an environmental assessment prior to the well construction and that would disclose the environmental impacts as well as including archaeological, cultural, and Ka Paʻakai analysis. I appreciate the fact that guidelines will be worked on for Ka Paʻakai because they're really needed, I think they're a bit loose. Then you mentioned the bulletin, so there are probably other ways to notify the public and allow comment, but that's our testimony and thank you for the opportunity to provide supporting testimony and I'm available for any questions.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Good morning Commissioners, Chair Chang - Kawika Uyehara, Deputy Department of Water Supply, County of Hawaiʻi. Yes, we did submit testimony and submitted testimony in support of the staff's original submittal, but hearing some of the comments and discussion made today which is very informative, I just wanted to add a couple new comments for consideration. I guess first, if there is a revised submittal from staff then what we hope to be able to comment officially on that via the testimony process in regards to the item 1A, I believe, we recognize and acknowledge if it is a rulemaking decision or discussion that needs to occur between CWRM and the AG, we respect that. We'll let that go through that process. In regards to Keauhou, we do also recognize and acknowledge the 2017 Non- designation decision, so we fully are in agreement with following those conditions, recommendations that came out of that decision and we will abide by that. Just to put in, to add to the Keauhou conversation and we do have at least one, I think, well construction permit or application in process right now with CWRM staff and it's kind of been in the process for a couple years from what I remember. Basically, it's helping us to develop another source to reduce or to actually allow us to get off of using the basal lens sources such as Kahaluʻu shaft and some of the other basal wells that we have in the aquifer. Again, we know there's a process, we just want to make sure that everyone understands. On our side, we're trying to develop some sources just to replace some of the older basal sources so we can reduce our reliance on basal. In addition, some of you folks may know that we're trying to downsize some of our wells just so we have better operations, we can operate a little bit better with reliability. By that, we lose capacity in some of our wells. One of the well construction applications we have in now is to kind of help us restore some of that capacity that we've lost but thank you for the time and the time to provide comments, thank you.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"After listening to this, I have a question for Ryan. I'm trying to remember if it came up in December, but how are we addressing that bifurcation of what happens in the designated versus non-designated? Honolulu BWS’ testimony reminded me what they confront procedurally is a little bit different. I know there's a flowchart, but does that change with this decision?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"No, again I don't think anything pertaining to permit approvals changes, the only thing that changes is the delegation. I think I mentioned in this submittal that there's two sides of it, there's a side that wants the bifurcation because they want to be able to drill a well and to better assess what are going to be the hydrologic impacts of pumping the well. Because you can do a Chapter 343, you can predict a Ka Paʻakai Analysis, you can say that but until you pump a well you're not going to be able to collect data that addresses those kinds of issues. Some agencies want to have the permit bifurcated so that they can drill the well first and assess, other agencies may want to make sure that they have the well and the pump permits in hand so that they don't invest like $2 million dollars in a well and then they can't get the pump installation permit. What I'm proposing is flexible and allowing both of those to happen. In a Water Management Area, clearly to get a pump installation permit, you need a water use permit. Those things will come to the Commission anyway, so I think that addresses the bifurcation in terms of like in management areas and non-management areas and our flexibility in allowing what I think people are looking for. I hope that answers your question.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Sorry, when I said bifurcated, I kind of meant like designated and non-designated. Say I'm an applicant, my pump is less than 27 gpm (gallons per minute). Is there a clear way that we can understand what you're proposing? Like okay, so it's less than 27 and you're located in Waiʻanae - okay, well it's going to be maybe posted on the bulletin but it's not going to have to come before the Commission. Correct?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"So, Waiʻanae is not a management area, right? That's what you're saying, so non-management areas.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I'm thinking about it, making it easier to understand from the permit applicant side, what that routing is.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I get that you want to make it easier, but it is a complex issue because is it a non-management area, management area? Is it a domestic use, is it a non-domestic use? Is it below 27 or is it under 27? If it's below 27 and it's for individual domestic use in a non-management area, then it's delegated approval to the Chair. If it's below 27 in a non-management area and it's used for industrial water bottling then it does come to the Commission.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I think what could be made clear is just “how this is the existing workflow” and “this is how the workflow will change” and “this is how it will improve permit processing time.” Sorry, maybe you're thinking about it in terms of your workload, but I'm thinking about it in terms of like there's a lot of text and if there is a clear diagram of the changes being suggested, I think it would be helpful. I’m not asking for it now, but if that could be as part of the staff’s four tasks like clarifying what that workflow, that modified workflow is, I think that would help in making transparent what this delegation involves. I think it's just more for like public understanding and I know you have a lot on your time, but I think it would sort of front end some of the concerns and questions, as well.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"We can do that, yeah we can do that.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"It would certainly help my brain, so thanks.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I would just say for the record, in December when Hāpuna came out, I would tell you I was very concerned about everything being delegated. It wasn't delegated to the Chair, it was delegated to the First Deputy. When I came on board and then hearing the concerns by Jonathan Scheuer, Kapua Sproat, and it was more process than it was substance. For me I distinguish two things - procedurally it is wanting to have transparency, wanting to make sure that our process is fair and objective. Since December to now, we've taken away the delegation to the Chair and we've given it back to the Board. I think Ryan has had comments, he's consulted apparently with like the water departments, not fully with DHHL, but you did have a conversation with Jonathan that there seems to be good recommendations that have come forward. I mean for me some of the substantive issues are being addressed in the Ka Paʻakai guidelines because there may be a difference of opinion with some of us on the Commission. I do believe that there is a requirement for Ka Paʻakai Analysis in everything we do. The scope of that analysis to me is determined based upon the action that's being proposed. There may be a big difference between an individual domestic well, less than 27 versus a water bottling use. I do think Ka Paʻakai, the issues may be different, like the 343. To a certain extent I sort of saw this as an SMA minor-major. SMA minor- there is delegation to the planning director, but it fits certain categories. I think that's what this was an attempt to do - was saying we're going to follow the Ka Paʻakai guidelines, if it follows the pump installation standards that can be delegated, I think, if the two different criteria that you put under here. I also like the one that Aurora brought up that there should be another section that says, “it shall not supersede any Commission actions including for example the Keauhou designation, eight conditions that were put on there that that should apply. In any cases where the Board has taken action, that this delegation should not supersede that, that those other conditions should be included or brought back to the Board. I also like the comment by Andrew Choy about additional forms of notice. I think even publishing an OEQC [former Office of Environmental Quality Control] bulletin, that's probably much more widely read than perhaps our own website. I’d also like us to consider, Andrew made a recommendation to amend two and adding F - pumps and aquifers where DHHL has a reservation. That seemed to be reasonable. In my mind, procedurally we've begun to address that. My concern was transparency, due process, if we're addressing notice. Substantively, it looks like the staff has come down with some criteria, whether that's rulemaking, that's another question. Obviously we're not going to be here to answer that, so Commission, your thoughts.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I’d hate for the last action I take is deferral because it feels like it's kicking a can down the road, but I wonder if you're thinking - it's the right thing to do, we need to do it right. If we deferred floating the idea of should we defer so that number one, Ryan has an opportunity to consult with DHHL. They are a public trust use, beneficial use, they should have an opportunity for meaningful consultation. Secondly, to consider the other ideas and recommendations that were made here today and other feedback that you received that you can add to the recommendations. Third, to really develop a workflow diagram that takes your 700 or 800 applications and kind of runs them through a chart that then shows how many drop off and how much more efficient you get and what you're going to focus on so that the Commission can see it, as Aurora has recommended. And fourth, consult with the AG on the correct legal process for achieving these desired.",1,B2,06/18/2024
Is that a motion?,1,B2,06/18/2024
"Can we have comments on this? COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: Yeah, let's comment.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I guess I'm on the other side of the fence and that issue of whether it's rulemaking, administerial is here, but for me the issue is do we want to impede the process if we pass and adopt what's here today as amended. We can go down the road and fix it and address it as the issues arise and it gives time for further review, but it gives at least an authority to move and address these issues as presented and as discussed in a lot of detail. When I first read this document, that's where it sort of came out - is it right for adoption? But again the alternative is to do nothing and again have this issue keep rolling down the road. I guess I'm in the camp right now is that approve it with this issue. We can address it at subsequent meetings to correct it.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I have a comment about that. I'm sort of on the other side of that, I'd like to get the legal question addressed first because if we're doing something that is illegal rulemaking or whatever, that our actions that we take is subject for dissolution and so I'd rather defer and seek the counsel of our...",1,B2,06/18/2024
Is there sort of clear areas or gray areas where we are looking at in the recommendations where it is rulemaking?,1,B2,06/18/2024
"Can I can get in on this? That was a question for me too which is, what are we talking about possible rulemaking? Is it the delegation for the individual...",1,B2,06/18/2024
For me it was the exceptions.,1,B2,06/18/2024
"It's the exceptions? I don't understand that at all. Here we are, we have had the delegation for what, 27 years? Nothing has come up about that. There was always the flexibility of the Chair when he or she and most of the time it's been a she, have had concerns about that that was brought to the Commission for us to decide. I guess because the issue has been raised, we got to find out whether it is rulemaking or not, but from my point of view it doesn't make any sense that this is now all of a sudden the rulemaking issue has raised its head.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I totally agree with that, but for me it's the public has raised this issue as well as some of the Commission members and so it is an easy fix for us to just seek the counsel of the Attorney General's office and then we could put a period on it. Because of these cases, these lines of cases, it is not rulemaking and therefore you could go forward on your action. If we don't get that response, the opinion from the Attorney General's office, it will always be a question out there whether it is or it isn't. For me, it would be a simple question to the AG's office that they can just answer quickly, do the analysis of those cases, and say what we're doing is not illegal rulemaking.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Because Kathy, in your view, if it was just a pure delegation to the Chairperson, there would be no issues. It's the rulemaking is these conditions, these exceptions. I think in the past, Larry, the delegation has just been a blanket delegation so that's why I don't think the rulemaking issue has come up in the past because it’s been total discretion to the First Deputy and the Chairperson.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"The issue of rulemaking will be germane only if someone challenges it. If nobody says anything about it being a rulemaking, the only way that the issue would come up is if someone sues the Commission to say you're doing illegal rulemaking.",1,B2,06/18/2024
But then it could potentially make us vulnerable in all of the actions that we've taken.,1,B2,06/18/2024
"Wait a second, on what actions? Is it the ones that we just routinely had delegated or the ones that the exceptions were made because if it's only the exceptions that are rulemaking, it's only the exceptional cases that would be subject if the suit was successful that said you were doing illegal rulemaking. All the others, from what I understand the issue is, would be okay, right? All the ones that would be routinely approved would be okay because that's not rulemaking. Anyway, since now it's been so befuddled, how quickly can we get an answer from the Attorney General's office? Tomorrow will it come?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Can you do a subject to? Is there an option to approve this, subject to review by the Attorney General?",1,B2,06/18/2024
Then that becomes a non-action because it's conditional. What does that mean then?,1,B2,06/18/2024
"The other alternative is, we could go into executive section and seek the legal advice of our attorney now.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"But we’re still not done, it seems to me that there's enough hesitance that we're not going to make a decision today.",1,B2,06/18/2024
I’m off the hook.,1,B2,06/18/2024
I'd rather wait till the next meeting to make a decision even though Neil will be gone. You can have my proxy vote.,1,B2,06/18/2024
"Are you going to be gone? COMMISSIONER MIIKE: No, no.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Okay, you're going to be here.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Anyway if we can make a decision the next time around, then I'm okay waiting one month but boy these things are so dragging. Everything we're doing now gets dragged out. I thought we were a decisive Commission.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"The risk of somebody suing us because you're allowing more public process seems remote, but the real risk is if somehow the actions that we take to issue permits are then tainted by this confusion, then that affects some driller, some entity that's out there doing something that they think they have the authority to do, but then somebody questions whether that authority was correct. It's fruit of the tainted tree.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"It just seems to me what would logically follow if this is found to be rulemaking is that all the ones that were routinely approved would be denied because the Board didn't act on it. I don't know, is the legal default position that everything that comes to the Commission has to be individually approved by the Commission? That sounds nuts that we had to actually vote on each and every one of them. That's no way to run a Commission.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"No, you're right and I do think that there are frameworks upon which we can work the parameters and maybe that's what the AG's office can provide us guidance on, but I think in the past there has been no parameters. It has been a blanket delegation and that doesn't trigger rulemaking, but it triggers in my mind a tremendous amount of discretion that the Chairperson has or the First Deputy has. I wasn't comfortable with that either. Ryan, did you want to make a comment?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Just a comment that if rulemaking affects this decision or maybe there's a question- should rulemaking affect the decision that was made in December of last year, too? Because I think it's the same thing and I think that maybe if rulemaking was an issue, that should have been an issue in December, too. I just wanted to bring that up.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"No, but the December decision was not to delegate, it was to bring everything back to the Commission, right?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"But there were exceptions and I think that's where rulemaking is looking at the exceptions, right? I think December also had exceptions to it.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I have one last question. It's not about this, it's about - where's DHHL? We've been talking with Jonathan Scheuer just about every time we have a meeting. Is he not representing your agency?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Jonathan does represent our agency, he is human and needs a vacation so that's why staff is here.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"That's why you're here now, but you were basically complaining that we had not consulted with DHHL and all along we've been talking to Jonathan. As a matter of fact, Jonathan has been very assertive about appearing before the Commission. So what is your position about when DHHL gets consulted?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I think if you look at the submittal, you can see very clearly that the Boards of Water Supply, Departments of Water Supply were clearly consulted well before this action was taken and it's documented in the submittal. We were just notified about it over the weekend over a phone call.",1,B2,06/18/2024
That's not my question. My question is that we have to formally ask every time and whenever Jonathan shows up that he's showing up as an individual person and not with DHHL? The reason I ask is that I thought we've been talking with DHHL just about at every meeting.,1,B2,06/18/2024
"When Jonathan appears before the Commission, he will either announce that he's talking on behalf of the Department or not.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Yeah, as a matter fact he has done that. Okay, so what you're wanting is more inclusion in the formal process? Okay, all right, thank you.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"As I understand, it's this particular item, it’s this agenda.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Correct, I think there are good examples of other collaboration between Commission staff and the Department in other arenas.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Sorry, can I add in that the December, this Commission decision specifically identified that we talk to Departments of Water Supply and come back with a decision. You guys identified that we needed to talk with Department of Water Supplies which I was trying to comply with. I also recognized that I think it would have been a good idea to reach out to Jonathan. Should I have reached out to him earlier? I mean maybe, but I did reach out to him to see if he had comments on it and I alerted him to the submittal and wanted him to be able to provide feedback today.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Chair, Keola Talaroc is also on. He had wanted to testify earlier, was having issues, but he's available now if you want.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I did close public comments, but Keola, go ahead if you wanted to provide comments.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Aloha Chair and Commissioners, my name is Keola Talaroc. I'm the drillings operation manager for Alpha Inc. I just wanted to give a perspective from the drilling contractor side because that hasn't been presented. For your guys' meetings, you guys hold them once a month. If we can achieve two permits per meeting, that would only be 24 a year. To say that that wouldn't slow down the permitting process or affect things other than just time is...what I'm trying to say, sorry...we're affecting more things by putting a lot of red tape for small wells that don't have as large of an effect. In quantity, if we have a bunch of small wells, it might have a big effect, but for how much resources we're spending to look at a well that's less than 27 gallons a minute, we could be spending that same time looking at larger wells that present possibly bigger issues. On the second hand, I also want to talk about the Ka Paʻakai Analysis and developing a framework for what we need to answer. There's a bunch of questions and it leads to things that we can't answer 100% correctly without having data. We want to be able to correctly answer these questions, but there's questions like what kind of impact do the wells have on the environment, what kind of impact do they have on near and offshore fisheries? These are things that without data, applicants, not only drilling companies but people going in for groundwater use permits, they'll have a really difficult time answering. That's all I wanted to say, thank you for letting me speak.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I appreciate you being here. Keola, can I ask you what's been the difference in the permitting time from last year December to today? Since everything has had to come before the Commission, what kind of impact has that had on your business from December 2023 to today?",1,B2,06/18/2024
"I think it was leading up to December, there started to be a lot more regulation and discussion of what needs to be submitted with the permit applications. Prior to that, we did see closer to a 90 day turnaround once we got a confirmation that everything we have submitted has been reviewed and approved. It was closer than 90 days. For people to comment like ʻAha Moku and Department of Water Supply, we would see an approval or denial of a permit application. Now, it's been over a year for some of our permits that are really only asking for 25 gallons a minute. Some of them are asking for water for their livestock. Things like that, I don’t necessarily feel should be given to you guys [inaudible]. Wells that only do 25 gallons a minute for small stuff is taking up a lot of your guys valuable time where we could be talking about wells that are going to help solve greater issues like affordable and low-income housing. Those are bigger wells that are going to have a lot more usage coming out of them and that's items that you guys should really be discussing and what impacts that might have versus a guy that wants water for his horses. You guys dissect things which is very good, but I feel like we need to aim what we're dissecting because right now when customers ask when will their permit be approved, I can't give them an answer. I say it has to be presented in front of the Board and then they say, okay well what's that schedule look like? And then I have to tell them, well they meet once a month and we only get the agenda six days before the meeting. It's very difficult for people to even have an idea of a timeline and we've also been asked the question, can we do this without a permit? We're not going to do that, but that's not saying someone else won't do it and if we have people doing illegal wells, then we have no way of tracking the impacts that is happening on our aquifer. It's just for the need of water, so that's all I have.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"Thank you very much, Keola. Your testimony has been very enlightening, to have real ground truthing on the impacts of our different processes. With the delegation was 90 days. Without the delegation, coming to the Commission, you're waiting for like about a year. Thank you, Keola.",1,B2,06/18/2024
"MOTION: (HANNAHS / MIIKE) To defer staff submittal in order to: 1. Allow staff time to consult with DHHL on impacts and merits of the recommendations, 2. Consider other testimony offered today, 3. Create and present a workflow chart in the submittal that will assist in understanding the flow of applications, and 4. Consult with the Attorney General’s office on the legal process for achieving the desired results",1,B2,06/18/2024
"The next item on the agenda is Item C1. It is an action item, Request to Authorize the Chairperson to Enter Into a Joint Funding Agreement With USGS to Conduct a Seepage Analysis on Waikoloa Stream, Island of Hawai‘i. Ayron.",1,C1,07/26/2023
"Thank you, Chair. Ayron Strauch with the Stream Protection and Management Branch. I'm gonna briefly do a presentation on the background and reasoning why we're funding this specific stream  stream flow analysis for seepage run. I also want to add that in the title, it's (inaudible) the project is exempt from the environmental assessment requirements under HRS Chapter 343 and HAR Chapter 11-200.1.  So taking a step back, Current and Future Priority in-Stream Flow Standards. We have been working diligently in..i and West Maui throughout the last decade or so. We have in-stream flow standards in West Kauaʻi, north and south shores, and we are currently working to develop them in Southeast Kauaʻi. Last year, we established in-stream flow standards on Molokai. And in 2020 and 2021, we established in-stream flow standards in Kaukonahua, and then the Waiāhole Ditch case established them in the Waiāhole area. The Waikoloa Stream on the Big Island  can you see my cursor? Anyway, this blue segment on the Big Island is our  and Wailua on Kauaʻi are two areas of focus right now where we have developed an in-stream flow standard assessment report, which is the compilation of best-available information, and we are working with the water users and the community to develop an in-stream flow standard or an interim in-stream flow standard that protects public trust uses. Here is the draft in-stream flow standard assessment report that we published online in June, and we have sent out notices via email to stakeholders throughout the Waikoloa and Hawaiʻi Island region. We have a landing page for the in-stream flow standard report online. The report utilizes a seepage run conducted by the US Geological Survey in 2021 which measured seepage gains and losses through the main stem of Waikoloa Stream from its headwaters down to the mouth, and so the headwaters is this stream branch  sorry, you can't see my pointer.",1,C1,07/26/2023
"Are you full screen, by the way, or is that",1,C1,07/26/2023
"I am. Yeah, it should be full",1,C1,07/26/2023
Try that. Hold on.,1,C1,07/26/2023
"We'll just do this (inaudible). So we'll share screen (inaudible), and you can share, and you can access it.",1,C1,07/26/2023
So it's a little bigger.,1,C1,07/26/2023
And then you can actually see your pointer now.,1,C1,07/26/2023
"Oh, okay. So the Waikoloa Stream headwaters start in the Kohala protected  watershed protected area managed by DOFA and then flows down through Waimea Town all the way up through  and the lower reach is actually referred to as Waiʻulaʻula, and the stream is gaining flow up the mauka areas and it gains flows in this region of Waikoloa  or Waimea Town, but it's losing principally between the  the stream diversion that feeds the county water supply and where it  the geology transitions.   So, how do I  okay, there we go Okay. So here's the underlying geology. Again, These green dots are the measurement sites. The orange line is the stream where it's losing, and then the transition from the Hawi volcanics to the Hualālai volcanics  or Hamakua volcanics, sorry  is where it moves from losing to gaining, so it actually gains stream flow in this region. And this unique geology  we'd like to confirm that this stream flow is losing and the rate of loss, and then it's gaining at the rate of gain because it has implications for meeting the public trust needs of this stream Particularly, this region just below Lālāmilo Homesteads, this agricultural area has a historic ʻauwai system, multiple historic ʻauwai systems, and we have an informal complaint at this stage that there is insufficient water to meet the traditional practices of the agriculture in the area. This stream also runs through a number of parks and provides aesthetic and recreational value This stream was also identified in the USGS Water Resource Management Monitoring Needs Assessment published in 2020. Particularly, this seepage run right here, this blue line that's highlighted by USGS as a point that needs to be monitored, as understanding surface water-groundwater interactions in this region has implications for groundwater recharge as well Runs funded by the water commission, in the 2018 funding for the low-flow statewide low-flow project, a number of West Maui stream seepage runs were funded. In 2020, the commission approved funding for a number of West Lahaina side of West Maui seepage runs. And here on, in 2023, we're funding the Waikoloa Stream seepage run. Because we are physically constrained, we cannot just fund all stream flow or all streams identified as priority streams for seepage runs, but where the data are needed to make management decisions, we are going stream by stream, essentially So that's all I have for a presentation. The request (inaudible) the staff recommendations which are to authorize the chairperson to enter into a joint funding agreement between the Commission on Water Resource Management and the US Geological Survey to collect and (inaudible) to conduct seepage analysis (inaudible) measurements for one high-priority stream for a period of one year until June 30th, 2024. A joint funding agreement in the amount of $21,300 would be shared by the commission for $11,300 and the US Geological Survey for $10,000 Authorize the chairperson to make such further amendments or modifications to the contract agreement consistent with the terms set forth above as may be necessary to accomplish the goals described here, provided that any Amendment or modification does not require additional commission funding. Request that Hawai‘i Department of Water Supply comply with any stream diversion operational needs USGS deems necessary to conduct a successful seepage run. Declare that the project is exempt from EA requirements under HRS Chapter 343 and HAR Chapter 11-200.1. Are there any questions?",1,C1,07/26/2023
"Not a question, but it's fascinating, East Maui when you talked about the different characteristics of the geology. So between Hamakua and Hawi, what are the different characteristics?",1,C1,07/26/2023
"So there are perched water bodies. The Hawi volcanics tend to be thin and perched, providing some level of perched water bodies which contributes to lots of spring flow. The Y  that particular area of the stream in the Hawi volcanics is losing  is not yet determined.",1,C1,07/26/2023
"But one of the reasons why we're doing the seepage run, again, most of these volcanics are tend to be pretty porous, so  but that  there is a high elevation region where the Kohala volcanic, you know, chill building phase and the Mauna Kea chill building phase overlapped, so there's somewhat unique geology, especially in that Waimea Town region, that has higher elevationgroundwater. And that's known, there are a number of DWS wells that take advantage of that high-elevation groundwater for drinking water supply. But it also clearly contributes to sustaining stream flow. So it's just really a unique location, and there have been the biota data that are available demonstrates the stream supports native amphibious species, we know it supports a lot of recreational values, and this region has heavily concentrated in archaeological sites that relate to agriculture, both cooler dryland agriculture and wetland agriculture. C",1,C1,07/26/2023
"How much is being diverted, and what percent is that of the base flow?",1,C1,07/26/2023
"Great question. So the capacity of the diversion off the top of my head is somewhere, I think, 2.5 mgd, between 2 and 3 mgd, and that is a hundred percent of base flow.",1,C1,07/26/2023
"And so, historically, it went all the way down to the ocean?",1,C1,07/26/2023
How far down are those people that  with the agriculture lots?,1,C1,07/26/2023

"Takemoto, Agribusiness Development Corporation (ADC) Staff presented the progress of the Waimea Watershed Agreement which includes the parties of KAA, KIUC, ADC, Department of Hawaiian Homelands (DHHL), and Pōʻai Wai Ola.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Mark, can I ask you is ADC supportive of KIUC’s original plan in 2018 without the additional modifications to expand the 2018 plan?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"We don’t think it’s the best plan based on all the discussions, but we understand that as the project changed, we do not believe that is the best plan, however that is the plan that was agreed to. In absence of being able to agree to anything different, we’re saying that since that was agreed to then that would be the only place that we could do that. We don’t have the funds or the ability to just take over the work that was offered by KIUC, so right now we’re hoping that there’ll be some resolution that we can come to. Truthfully, we don’t think it’s the best plan, but in absence of being able to agree on an alternative, we have no choice but to say, well then go ahead.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Your original agreement was way before I was born, so I don’t know anything about the original, but when you come to an agreement, you never agree on one side thinks this is the best plan and the other side says, no it’s not. You come to some middle ground, so it seems to me that I don’t buy into a discussion that says, oh now we think the original agreement was not the best plan. You guys agreed, so I guess the question over here is that whether the offer from KIUC now is a reasonable offer and that the ones who have been offered to are, I know that’s not you, but it’s the other group. Are you holding out for the best plan or are you going to hold off for something that may be a little bit better than what was agreed on, but not what you now think is the perfect plan.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Well, the original agreement, I believe, was that KIUC would be running this system, this section, but we do realize that their plans have changed, that they’re no longer going to be running the system. We do understand that when we agreed to it, the understanding was that, well they’re going to be taking care of this so their modification should be based on their own plan. That’s how it started, I could be wrong, correct me if I’m wrong. That’s how those original modifications were determined and now that they’re not going to be running that segment, KAA is going to be running that segment, I would rather not impose upon KAA something that maybe is not workable. Like we said, because we can’t quite come to an understanding on this and ADC is not financially able to just take over at the offer that was made by KIUC, then we have no choice but to say, well okay we still have to address the original agreement that there was a commitment there to complete. Like I said, in absence of an agreement, we cannot unilaterally say, well you have to do this or not. Again, we have no choice but we’re going to agree to what everybody agreed to originally in absence of an alternate plan.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Just a quick clarification for what Mr. Takemoto was referring to. The original agreement had two phases and the first phase KIUC committed to certain modifications of the system and it was not tied to the project because the agreement had to leave open the possibility of whether the project would move forward or not. Then the second phase would be if the project moved forward, then KIUC would take care of certain parts of the system and so we’re still in the first phase and trying to do the first phase modification. The agreement was made without an understanding that KIUC would be running this system. There’s always the possibility that the project would not move forward and KAA and ADC would still be running the system. I know there’s a long history to this, but that’s where the agreement stands, two phases.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Hi, good morning, Chair. Thank you, good morning Commissioners. Elena Bryan on behalf of Earthjustice. We just want to underscore not only the importance but the urgency of these modifications and really urge the Commission to take an active role in ensuring that the obligations under the agreement that this Commission ordered are in fact carried out as expeditiously as possible. As you know, these modifications are phase one requirements under the agreement and they were intended to be implemented shortly after this Commission approved and ordered the terms of that agreement back in 2017. Looking at the language of the agreement, the modification plans were due to the Commission within 135 days and then work was supposed to begin within 45 days after approval of those plans, but 7 years later we’re still waiting on these phase one modifications to be implemented. Since the Commission deferred in January, we’ve met multiple times and the parties continue to bounce back and forth between KIUC’s plans or KAA’s proposed plans and back to KIUC’s plans and now KAA has an alternate plan. What’s most concerning for our clients is that it was brought to our attention during these compliance meetings that interim instream flow standards on Kōkeʻe aren’t being met, which we aren’t able to monitor because the monitoring stations required under the agreement which would measure the amount of water coming into the ditches and the amount of water going into the streams below the diversions on a continuous real-time basis, haven’t been installed. It’s our position that monitoring is a bare minimum, elementary obligation for any ditch operator seeking to use public trust water resources which the agreement and order only makes more imperative and mandatory in prescribing specific extensive monitoring regimes. We did submit a notice of ongoing violations and complaint against waste with the Commission almost a year ago in August of 2023, seeking to spur compliance with the agreement and the IIFS (interim instream flow standard) and to date, nothing has been done. Again, we just want to urge this Commission to take action to ensure that the public isn’t waiting another seven years for these modifications and most importantly crucial monitoring to be implemented.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I very much appreciate that testimony because our focus is on the resource itself and it sounds to me like our interests are being damaged by this delay because we’re not able to monitor it appropriately as planned. We can and wait and wait for the parties to resolve, but meanwhile something that’s of concern to us is at risk. What is staff’s view of this? Do we proceed? Is it your recommendation that we proceed, encourage the parties to implement the phase one as originally planned and designed in terms of the impact that it has on our interests?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I think, and Ayron may have thoughts on this more, but I think for us, if the KIUC project is not moving forward then we’d want and recognizing that KAA would be the one to take over, we’d want them to be in the best position to operate the system. Ideally, if they can come to some agreements and get the work done. Do you want to add anything?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Branch. There are certain elements of the KIUC proposal that were to be temporary in nature with the understanding that further phase two components would enhance the operation of the ditch. With the KIUC project phase two not moving forward, there are some concerns about the modifications that might in the long-term harm instream values, not allow for the most efficient operation of the system, and the State would be worst off, including the interests of DHHL, for example. We don’t want to interject in the discussions between two parties that are, we’re not the operators of the system, we don’t have the money to modify it, but at the same time, I think it would be worth having the Commission weigh in on whatever agreement KIUC and KAA, ADC come to. I don’t know where our role is, but for monitoring I think we do have much better monitoring of the streams today compared to seven years ago. I think we need more monitoring of the ditch system as a whole, but we can get that in place. We’re working with KAA and staff will be installing soon this summer IIFS monitoring stations. Monitoring of Kauaikinana has been upgraded, the modifications to Waiakōali will ensure that the IIFS is met. I don’t know if you have any questions.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Let me see if I understand. Yes, there’s an adverse impact in the continuing delay, but it’s a risk that you sound like we’re willing to take or live with because of the potential benefits to public trust interests if they get this done better, if they get this done well.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"There are modifications that, say at the Waiakōali intake, that KIUC has proposed that are different from what KAA would do in the long run. KAA would make structural modifications to ensure the instream flow standards were met, but they’re not going to put in a really complex monitoring setup to monitor those modifications, whereas we could, CWRM staff could monitor the IIFS ourselves. But in the original agreement, we weren’t charged with doing that. It was an option but with the money on the table for KAA, there’s just not enough for them to monitor the IIFS, but the ditch is being monitored at the moment and we could put in, CWRM staff could put in an IIFS monitoring station downstream to ensure compliance. That’s where the original Commission order had the operator monitoring the IIFS, but the money on the table would just not be sufficient to monitor the IIFS by the operator, by KAA if they accepted the KIUC dollar. Whereas the majority of that money that’s on the table from KIUC would go to modifying the Kawaikoʻi intake better than what KIUC is proposing. The original plan for KIUC was a cofferdam structure which is quite intrusive into the stream channel, well into the ditch, which is in the stream channel at this point, and the KIUC proposal is not what would be implemented if KAA built what they’re proposing, which is a functioning control gate at the point of the intake so that the water would remain in the stream. Long term, they could add power to it so it would be remotely operable and that sort of thing, I think that in the long term would benefit the stream.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"In a nutshell, we prefer the KAA plan, DR. STRAUCH: Yes.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"But the means to pay for it is what’s at issue. What more leverage do we have, does anybody have on KIUC to make them put up more than the half million they’ve offered when they don’t have the project upon which we can make that a condition. So, is there a leverage to get them to contribute a greater amount?",0,C2,05/21/2024
I’m not in the position.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"It feels like they’re preserving, they’re doing this to preserve an option that they may want to do this in the future and they know that if they do this, they’re still in the game. That may be an unfair, Mr. Inafuku can clarify that if that’s not a fair characterization, but leverage. Do we have to get more from them and if time keeps going by where this goes unresolved because there seems to be a pretty big gap between the parties at some point, when do you decide just to do something even if it’s not perfect? You can respond to Commissioner Miike.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"One more on Kōkeʻe Stream, for example, the original proposal was a large pipe over the stream to carry the ditchwater to the tunnel. That in itself, I don’t think could be built with the monitoring stations in the stream with money left over for all the other modifications. It’s seems a little unreasonable. That’s not the modifications that KAA would want to do. I also don’t think that we need monitoring in Kōkeʻe if we get the intake at the head of the tunnel because the stream is used to convey the ditchwater. It’s a small stream, it’s a challenging stream to monitor. There isn’t really a great place upstream or downstream in the intake, but it’s still a condition of the agreement is the problem. That’s where the Commission needs to weigh in on, are all of these things that were in the original agreement still a requirement of KAA if they accept the KIUC money to implement what we think is the best plan?",0,C2,05/21/2024
Is that a management issue or is that a legal issue?,0,C2,05/21/2024
It’s partially a legal issue because if it’s in the agreement it has to be done correct.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"I’m not familiar with the agreement, let me check with the attorney who is.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"A couple things, one is I hear might be, one says the best plan. I don’t hear anything about some probabilities about any of these things happening. For example, it might be really bad for the stream, but with any particular proposal whether it be a KIUC or KAA, what’s the chances of that happening? Now I don’t want to wait to say that we’re going to do something so that there is absolutely no risk, no such thing. Second of all, from the very first Supreme Court decision on these stream things which was the Waiāhole case, the Supreme Court said that, hey we’re not an umpire trying to mediate between two parties, we’re the ones that have to protect our resources. So, you make a decision whether these parties agree or not and it has to be that we look at the resource first and the economic interest or whatever of the parties secondary. I don’t want to wait anymore for all these back and forth saying, oh we want to do this, no, I don’t want you guys to do this, we want you to do this. We’re not going to end up with anything, so I’d like to make a decision today.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Unfortunately, we can’t, Larry, it’s not agendized as a decision item. COMMISSIONER MIIKE: Next time around then.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"It doesn’t seem as though when we wait that there’s going to be some agreement. There’s so many contingencies about these people saying we want to do this, but we don’t have the money, oh we want to do this but this is all we’re going to give. It’s going to be endless.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Just a short response, Chair, the agreement for phase one was that the parties would help cooperate with KIUC so that we could do due diligence for the West Kauaʻi Energy Project and in exchange, KIUC would proceed with the modification plan as agreed to by the parties. That modification plan is this 2018 plan. We were able to get the assistance of everybody to do the due diligence and we need to proceed with the 2018 plan. The second phase would be if we had chosen to do the project, then there would be a whole another set, a phase two. We are willing to do the 2018 plan. At this point, what’s changing about the agreement is the parties view of that plan and so for KIUC’s point of view, as the project is no longer proceeding, we have less of an input on the scope of the project that they would like to do moving forward, but our legal obligation is the 2018 plan and that’s what we’re offering and willing to do, or we have been discussing with KAA and ADC since they will be the ones operating the system. If they would like to do a different plan, we could give a monetary contribution to that plan rather than move forward and construct a plan that they don’t want.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I’m sorry, did you want to add anything else?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"No, just to say but under the agreement the obligation for KIUC to do the modification plan that we agreed to in 2018 and so that’s the basis of our interest in this. Anyway, the negotiation discussion is ongoing but frankly this conversation today has been very informative because sometimes it’s easier to hear everybody’s point of view and perspective here.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I’m surprised, do you guys not have conversations where you’re hearing each other’s view? Is this the first one? Inside the testimony, there’s been numerous meetings. Have you not had this kind of discussion?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"There have been numerous meetings, Chair. I think there is some confusion about what the different parties’ responsibilities and duties are under the agreement. I think the project being withdrawn has taken everybody for a little bit of a loop.",0,C2,05/21/2024
But the original agreement contemplated that might happen.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"It did, that’s why the obligations are split into phase one and phase two.",0,C2,05/21/2024
I wonder if KAA has a different view of the agreement?,0,C2,05/21/2024
"Well can I just ask, Jordan, KIUC is offering $500,000. Is your $500,000 based upon a 2018? I’m just wondering for purposes of present value, that is now six years since the agreement. That $500,000, is there a possibility just to reflect inflation and change? Construction cost, I mean everything has changed over the last six years. Your $500,000 has remain stagnant based upon the 2018 agreement. Is there any opportunity to increase that amount? I mean that’s separate and apart, but is there an opportunity to increase that?",0,C2,05/21/2024
I understand the question and I’ll let Dawn answer because she has more information about the basis for that.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"Aloha Chair, thank you. The basis for the proposed financial contribution of $500,000, actually we developed that after receiving cost estimates from KAA for KAA’s proposed plan and for KIUC’s plan. KAA sent us two cost estimates, one was for their plan, the KAA plan, and one was KIUC’s cost estimate for the KIUC 2018 plan. We reviewed those cost estimates and that’s how we developed the $500,000 to cover work commensurate from the KAA plan with the KIUC obligation.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Was it 2018? Go ahead, I’ll let you finish.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"That $500,000 was not a fixed cost estimate from 2018. CHAIR CHANG: I see, so that $500,000 is based upon KAA’s present plans?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"It’s based on KAA’s cost estimate for the 2018 plan and KAA also had provided a cost estimate for their plan, their preferred plan. The discussions that have been ongoing for the last few months, part of that discussion is what scope is in the 2018 plan and what scope the parties believe is outside the 2018 plan.",0,C2,05/21/2024
But isn’t the point of your question is are those 2018 estimates or are they current dollars?,0,C2,05/21/2024
They’re current [inaudible] from KAA.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"Can we clarify the if KIUC were to implement their 2018 plan, what the actual cost would be for that today?",0,C2,05/21/2024
We estimated it based on KAA’s cost estimate.,0,C2,05/21/2024
But what is that number? I don’t remember off the top of my head.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"I just want to be real clear, so are you saying that KAA? Josh has got his hand up, Josh you want to add something to this?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Yes, I should clarify here when we estimated the total cost of both projects, our initial estimate was somewhere north of $2 million for both, so $2 million plus for KAA’s, about $2 million for KIUC. We went through some, I guess you could call it value engineering discussions with Dawn, where she identified that we had put too much into sensor packages things like that. Our latest total estimate for the scope is about just shy of $2 million for KIUC’s plan and just shy of $1.7 million for KAA’s plan. As far as we can tell, the $500,000 is based on if you took our current cost estimates for specific items in KAA’s plan and the specific items in KIUC’s plan and you just took the overlap between the two plans, the features that would be constructed in roughly analogous ways, in common between the two plans, that would be about $500,000. That’s our understanding of where that number came from, but if you had to build the entire 2018 plan, at least based on our estimate in today’s dollars, it would be just shy of $2 million.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I guess that’s what I’m trying to get to is if we look at the 2018 plans but we’re building it today in 2024, what is the actual cost estimate? I guess Dawn, there seems to be apples and oranges between what Josh is saying and what you’re saying, at least for me.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I think I’ll go back to what Jordan was saying, from my perspective we have a disagreement on scope. So, until that gets reconciled, we have not done procurement, we were waiting on permits, getting our final permit before we do a procurement process to select a contractor for the work. I don’t have, aside from KAA’s cost estimates and some other data points I have on equipment and some installation cost, but not a complete installation cost package, I don’t have a current cost separate from KAA’s cost estimate for KIUC’s plan. However, we do have a disagreement on scope, so I think that’s where we are not aligning.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Josh, is the $2 million what it takes to implement phase one or phase one and phase two?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Phase one, so just for order of magnitude, just building the cofferdam and all the required work going into that as well as the *pipe across Kōkeʻe Stream, we estimate that probably is in the ballpark of half a million already, just for those two things. Then you have to do the other work on other things and so we provided our estimates in detail, broken down to man hours required, equipment required, material costs at least based on our understanding. We did that to be transparent, partly also because enough of the work is analogous if not identical that if KIUC is able to get that work done for phase one much cheaper than our estimate, that implies that we also could have done that if we had better numbers. We tried to be very transparent on the detailed basis of our estimate and we did see some of that, as I mentioned earlier where we had cost for some of the sensor packages significantly higher than KIUC, so they gave us some information on what they had been planning to do instead and so we revised down our cost estimate for those things. That’s kind of how we approached that.",0,C2,05/21/2024
Is the dispute over scope or cost?,0,C2,05/21/2024
"Right now, the disagreement is between when we get the cost estimates from KAA and the line items that they have allocated to those cost estimates, when we take a look at and compare it to the 2018 plan, we come out with a different number and those would be the areas that we could negotiate under.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"But my question is, do you just disagree on the cost or do you disagree on the line items? That’s scope.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Yes, scope. We don’t have another cost estimate at this point because until we get the permits, we have not done our own procurement for the work.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Can I ask a different question? This is for Ayron, when I look at exhibit three of KAA’s testimony, they have a detailed breakdown, present day value, KIUC and KAA alternative. What I see in the KAA alternative is remote control options for the diversions that basically double the cost of managing that diversion, but for phase one, we have temporary means to meet IIFSs. Is that temporary means sufficient for the near term? Because the added costs come in from that remote control. I’ll just be honest, I don’t think it’s not necessarily fair to hold KIUC -that has no longer a long-term interest in this- to pay for that which is really in KAA’s and ADC’s long-term financial benefit and the stream. Is the interim kind of temporary measure to meet IIFS acceptable from our standpoint on the Commission?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Now I’m going to get multiple projects swirling in my head confused but at Waiakōali, let’s just take one example, without investing much money KAA can modify the intake with boards, lumber. They can cut a notch in the dam and ensure that the IIFS is being met under low flow conditions, but they’re not going to be able to regulate the intake.",0,C2,05/21/2024
But we’re doing our part.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"Part of the agreement was that the operator would take responsibility for meeting the IIFS and monitoring that, but if KAA were to implement the low cost option ,they wouldn’t have the money to monitor the IIFS. CWRM staff have used KIUC equipment and are monitoring the ditch and then we would put in our own low cost IIFS monitoring in the stream, but that would be independent of KAA’s implementation of anything. They will be able to meet the IIFS, it just won’t be in real time, it won’t be adjustable remotely, that sort of thing.",0,C2,05/21/2024
Those are “nice to have.”,0,C2,05/21/2024
"That is sufficient, but it’s in the agreement that they need to monitor real time, that the operator needs to monitor in real time. That’s where I think there’s this negotiation between KIUC and KAA, but there’s also the requirements that the Commission ordered that are on the table that we might need to address or that you need to address.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"The Commission is not party to this, we are external to it, we ordered or facilitated the mediation, but if this negotiation were to be revisited, that would mean that the parties have to agree. But what is up in front of us eventually is the permit and so what I recall from last meeting is things can be approved and then come back with modifications potentially.",0,C2,05/21/2024
You mean the permits? Yeah.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"If the design needs to change, I think KIUC is just trying to meet its obligations and to find the best path forward and have suggested monetary compensation. As the Commission, we need to think about does this meet what we ordered and then if we need to increase the cost or decrease the cost or reweight things, can we help provide the guidance to the parties so that they’re not just playing tug of war with line items, but we say “this is what’s needed at Waiakoali,” “this is what’s needed at Kawaikoʻi” given the updated circumstances. Are we able to provide that technical information to help people understand what that threshold of meeting the IIFS is? I don’t know if that’s clear. Is there technical information that we can provide to help them navigate this next step at this point? Do we have all we need to know right now?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I don’t know what you’re asking so I think what we should do is modify Waiakoali a certain way, Kawaikoʻi a certain way, Kawaikinana a certain way and we know where we need to monitor the IIFS. We are monitoring the streams as needed. The issue is that KIUC is proposing to build a giant cofferdam right behind the head wall in Kawaikoi which is going to be potentially [inaudible], but they’re basically piling up a whole bunch of dirt with a pipe under underneath it and that in itself is problematic. I don’t think that’s a great use of State resources. This is going to be visually intrusive, it might get washed away by a high flood, there’s some issue. It was meant to be temporary, there’s not going to be a way to regulate the flow through the cofferdam.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I guess for me on the Commission, I don’t want to micromanage the design of the specific feature but you have the technical expertise to advise us on whether it is a good decision or not. What I hear from you is KIUC’s design is not something we necessarily want for multiple reasons and so do you have the line item? Has Josh provided, say Ayron, some of the details of that cost estimate besides exhibit 3? Could the Commission staff weigh in on it?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"We have weighed in and we’ve spoken to everybody. We can’t force two parties to come to some sort of, I can’t do it, the Commission can order maybe something, but I think a way forward would be potentially to have KIUC put to bid what this project is that they’re proposing and come back to us with the cost estimate for what they’re proposing. If it’s different from KAA, okay, but we now know what it would cost for KIUC to implement their project and we have another point to work with.",0,C2,05/21/2024
Why doesn’t KIUC just implement the terms of the agreement? Why is KAA?,0,C2,05/21/2024
It’s like if somebody were to make a modification to a car and then return the keys to you and you don’t want the way it was modified.,0,C2,05/21/2024
But can’t KAA make conditions upon which they accept it and then we have an enforcement authority if they’re not complying with the IIFS or if they’re causing harm to the stream? Don’t we have an enforcement arm to do that to ensure that they’re in compliance?,0,C2,05/21/2024
"The thing is they’ve prepared this plan with the general acceptance of everybody, granted that was under the expectation that phase two was going to move forward.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I’m feeling like we’re totally out of our lane, but the settlement is not, well I’m not sure.",0,C2,05/21/2024
Let me explain why it’s important to be able to modify the intake successfully so that they can be operable because we have public trust uses that are dependent on the irrigation system and we want to make sure that the operator can meet those obligations while meeting the instream flow standard as best as possible.,0,C2,05/21/2024
Are you saying you cannot do that under the terms of that settlement agreement?,0,C2,05/21/2024
"Well, I’m saying that there are certain modifications that need to be made so that the intakes can be controlled and specifically Kawaikoi is the primary intake that feeds the system. Remote operation of the Kawaikoi intake is key. There are better people who operate the irrigation system on the call that can talk to that.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I just wanted to share that I think the reason that they can’t answer you on that is because we’re talking about like what Commissioner Kagawa-Vivani was touching on, we’re talking about the difference between manual and automatic monitoring and we’re talking about the different preferences for this plan when in actuality it’s already been agreed to by the parties what the scope of the plan is. It was agreed to on April 2, 2018 and that is the structure of the mediation agreement as it stands. That’s the responsibility of KIUC so that’s the rub here, we keep moving toward changing the scope of what the plan is based on what the parties would like to do today, a lot of that around monitoring and having an automatic versus manual system there, but really there’s no legal mechanism to change. We’ve already agreed on the scope of what it is that KIUC is responsible to do. If the parties would like to do a different scope, that’s fine and that’s why we’ve had these discussions and KIUC has tried to participate in that, but as far as KIUC’s obligation here, that’s the scope.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"That’s what the parties agreed to, but did we approve?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"The Commission staff verbally approved it, I believe in May of 2018.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Phase one, phase two plan?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Yeah and that’s also the recollection of all the parties as it’s in ADC’s testimony, as well.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I just wanted to add that the Commission also approved permits, the same permits that are before you today, you approved those permits a few years ago. The reason they’re back before you today is because they expired while we were waiting for other permits, but you did approve the plan in that the work was included in those permits that were before for you a few years ago. I can look at the specific data, I don’t remember it off the top of my head, but same plan, same work.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"During the 2018 when the agreement was, did it also contemplate that KAA would operate the system?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Yes, I’m sorry, Jordan go ahead.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Yes, in the case that the project did not move forward, that’s what the agreement contemplates.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I would have to disagree with that. If you go back and look at ADC board minutes from November 2016, ADC board approved removal of the Kōkeʻe system from the scope of KAA’s responsibility in their memorandum of agreement with ADC. There was an ongoing issue at the time where there are parts of the system that already are not under KAA’s scope, but we operate just by necessity since there’s no other operator. It wasn’t clear that actually KAA would remain responsible if the energy project didn’t move forward, in fact the plans were already in place, the approvals were already done for us to step away and not by our choice but originally we were told with this other thing going on, you no longer have any significant involvement in the system or need for that going forward. The only reason we didn’t move forward with executing on that approval with ADC was we told ADC at the time if we step away now, who’s stepping into that the vacuum? I think there was some confusion as to whether from ADC’s part as to whether KIUC would step in in the interim. As Jordan said, the agreement doesn’t say that they do. The problem we saw at that point was we didn’t want to remain in charge of the system at that point, but if we stepped away, no one would be operating it and shortly the system would become inoperable. In 20/20 hindsight, if you have a 7-year period with no operator that system would have been totally destroyed by now. It wasn’t clear to us that KAA was going to be responsible, we chose to remain just to ensure that the system would remain functional in the interim period.",0,C2,05/21/2024
I have a question. Is the water from that diversion needed or not needed?,0,C2,05/21/2024
"Okay, then there’s a vested interest in ADC and KAA in sustaining it.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Well, the primary uses of the water are actually DLNR parks for the trout fishery in Puʻu Lua Reservoir and DHHL’s property. ADC has largely held off on developing the mauka lands above Waimea because this issue is unresolved. We don’t have certainty on what the significant supply of water would be available going forward. We put in plans, alternatives to pump water up from the Kekaha Ditch to irrigate the most arable sets of land on the ADC property. When you look at the actual preponderance of use and interest in the water, currently it’s DLNR and DHHL.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I have a completely different question then and it’s going back to something Ayron mentioned. I think it would be helpful for KIUC to have their own cost estimate and KAA to be able to share their design and cost estimate so that at least we and the Commission can understand if half a million dollars is a sufficient kind of settlement offer to meet phase one requirements that everyone agreed to. There are so many more questions that go beyond the scope of this particular permit that apparently need to be had, but I think a concrete step would be that independent cost estimate and to have a better understanding. I work with telemetered systems so I noticed the sort of flipping of the monitoring and control cost in that exhibit 3, but I think it would be really helpful when we come to a decision point to have that side to side because what I get is KAA is asking for more money because that doesn’t cover the cost of their desired modifications which may meet our Commission objectives more and KIUC is trying to just close up things and move on. I guess that would be a request of KIUC.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"If I could just clarify one point. KAA did not reject out of hand KIUC’s offer, what we did was we took the offer and tried to figure out what we could do with that amount of money and then we took that to the parties and said, okay well as Ayron said, there’s not enough money to do some of the things that are possibly even in the agreement and we can’t unilaterally decide to move forward with a plan where that is the case without the consent of the other parties. We took it to the other parties to say would you find it acceptable if this is what we’re able to do with this funding today, understanding we will try to get the funding to do the rest in future legislative sessions or from the federal government or something, but we don’t have a timeline on that and we don’t have certainty on that. That’s where we couldn’t come to that agreement, so that wasn’t a rejection by the KAA unilaterally.",0,C2,05/21/2024
Thank you for that clarification.,0,C2,05/21/2024
Commission staff are prepared to install IIFS monitoring where it has not historically been installed because we were waiting on phase one to go through.,0,C2,05/21/2024
What difference would it make on their cost estimates?,0,C2,05/21/2024
"Probably reduce the, I don’t know the individual cost estimates, but I think they proposed monitoring or at least KIUC’s original monitoring plan was probably in the order of $80,000 to $120,000 for all of the stations. I don’t know off the top my head all the intricacies because there’s some monitoring stations that are in ditches, some are in streams, some are at diversions. We have already put in two of those stations.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Just based upon this exhibit 3, one it looks like, it’s two, three maybe [inaudible] monitor. Somewhat of the difference between the KIUC and the KAA estimates.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Commission staff tend to, most of our stations are not telemetered. They’re low impact, they’re not built into the design of the modification of the intake where there’s a fixed geometry, and we monitor streams and ditches where it’s appropriate. But we have to do a substantial amount of field work involved, but some of the monitoring is tied to modifications of the system itself.",0,C2,05/21/2024
The total monitoring here is more like a quarter million.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"Which is probably the difference between KIUC and the KAA at least the total estimated cost which is far above the $500,000. What are the next steps? What happens if you don’t get an agreement? Do I have someone from DHHL here?",0,C2,05/21/2024
Jonathan Scheuer said he can jump on if you’d like.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"Jonathan if you want to provide us, we’ve heard from the other parties to this. Do you want to jump on?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I was going to say in response to the question I think as was mentioned previously. The only option that’s already been agreed to in 2018 was the phase one and our best estimate is if we actually proceeded forward with that, it would cost KIUC roughly $2 million to build, plus or minus. Maybe they can be more efficient than our estimates and then we would have to go to the legislature and get funding to modify it long term to meet all of our obligations and take out even some of the modifications that were installed by KIUC. I think there is sort of a default path, it’s just so wasteful at least from our perspective, that’s why we’re kind of low to go down that.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I’m sorry Josh, what is the default path? JOSHUA UYEHARA: The 2018 phase one.",0,C2,05/21/2024
Let KIUC build what they want to build.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"But KIUC has said that if we don’t want that build, they’ll give us the commensurate value, cost of it to build what it is we want or that is wanted here.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I don’t know if it’s commensurate, it sounds like... DR. STRAUCH: They’re only giving $500,000.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"The gap is between and KIUC’s position is without any independent cost estimate. I’m not sure what you’re pinning your $500,000 estimate to, but the people supplying you the cost information are saying it’s $2 million so on what basis are you saying it’s $500,000?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"We developed the $500,000 based on our review of KAA’s cost estimates for both their plan and the KIUC plan. We received the letter from KAA very late, so we have not had a chance to actually read it and review it in detail. I can’t really respond to that right now, but I think I’m hearing a lot of information for the first time today in this meeting. We have had a lot of meetings but we are hearing information for the very first time today that we can’t respond today in full. I think there’s some information lacking here so I would just like to say that I think we need to review the letter that was sent by KAA, we need to provide some additional information, full detailed information to everyone so we’re all working with the same information, and I’m not really prepared to comment any further unless you want to add something, Jordan.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"It’s a little bit inaccurate the reference to 2018 KIUC because that’s where the disagreement is, the scope and the cost estimate from KAA there and what we believe the 2018 plan says. We have space between those two so it’s not just the amount but it’s again as we said, scope, but we need a little bit more time to go and address that when we get these letters on the eve of a meeting or a Commission meeting.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Two things first, I want to ask the Earthjustice attorney what they think about this. I think in the last meeting you said you just want them to go ahead and get something done, correct?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Yes and no and thank you for the question. At the January meeting, that was the first that we had heard that there was a possible issue about KAA not being able to meet DHHL’s needs if the KIUC plan went. During these meetings that we’ve had and with information I’ve gathered today, we really don’t have any visibility or a full understanding on what the disagreement on scope is. We do agree that the KAA plan is advantageous and that it could be done quicker and what I gather from Ayron and others, more effectively manage the resources. Buit without information on what the disagreement on scope is, we think it would be reasonable for KIUC to fund what they would have otherwise had to pay to do their modifications if KAA’s plan fulfills those same obligations, which is to modify the divergence, to allow them to meet IIFS, stream connectivity, and then monitoring. We agree with Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani’s approach, we think it would be helpful for the Commission staff or Commission to help the parties understand what modification elements are needed to meet the obligations under the order and perhaps weigh in on the funding issue once we have a fuller understanding of the cost estimates. I just want to note that these phase one modifications were intended to be temporary. This was supposed to be a quick fix so that we could meet IIFS, we could monitor, we could gather critical data, and here we are 7 years later. KIUC decided not to pursue the project and so now we’re looking at a permanent installation and so I do agree with Josh that it would be wasteful to install the plan only for KAA to ask for more funding to implement their own plan. We hope that the parties can come to some sort of agreement on this cost issue because really the only thing that’s suffering by this delay is the public trust resource.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"My second issue is suppose we go ahead with KIUC’s original agreement on phase one and implement it, number one I heard KAA say it would be so wasteful and I heard Ayron say you’re not going to be able to monitor long term. My answer is so what. If that’s the issue you think it’s wasteful and you fix it and if our staff thinks that it’s not going to be able to monitor it long term and that’s sort of you do the best you can and we fix it up later. Again, I don’t want us to go toward what some people think is the perfect solution while we just stand by for another seven years not doing anything. I think Jonathan is here now, I’d like also to hear what DHHL.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"If I could just briefly respond to that. We agree, we don’t want any further delay, in fact we’ve been trying for years to get this moving, but at the same time it’s our understanding that if KIUC were to move forward with their modifications, they have to go through procurement and bids and the process itself would be a lot longer than what KAA has said. I understand that this was back in our January, February, March discussions. We were told that they could get their modifications in by October of 2024. Of course, I’m assuming that that timeline has shifted because now we’ve been in four months of negotiations at this point, but just on that basis alone KAA as a ditch operator it sounds like would be able to get their modifications done a lot quicker.",0,C2,05/21/2024
But they say they don’t have the money. Isn’t that the issue now?,0,C2,05/21/2024
"That’s where the disagreement lies and again, that’s why I think Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani’s approach is helpful because it would help give the parties a better understanding on what the disagreement on scope is and I think if we have all of the information in front of us, what the disagreement is, what the cost estimates are, that perhaps the parties can more effectively negotiate a resolution.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"From what my understanding is that so all of that is done, KAA still says they don’t have the money even with whatever is the contribution of KIUC, correct?",0,C2,05/21/2024
I’ll let KAA answer.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"What we did was we took KIUC’s offer of half a million dollars and we outlined to the other parties what we thought we could do with that. We think there is a way to move forward, the problem with that path is there are some of the modifications that are delayed until we procure additional funding and that has to be acceptable to the other parties to the agreement, that’s not something we can decide ourselves to accept. I think implicit in some of the other discussion about potentially modifying some of the requirements in the agreement, we treat that as requiring the consent of the parties to the agreement for that to occur. Given where our limited scope of modifications allowed by the funding offered imply an inability to meet some of those conditions right away, we need the consent of the other parties for that to be acceptable to them.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"But I also heard Dawn say that maybe they need more time to review KAA’s letter and I don’t want to put words in KIUC, but is there a possibility? I’m wondering at today’s meeting, we’ve got differences of opinion on scope, on price, have you been talking to each other? I don’t know if that’s rhetorical. Maybe we’ll let Jonathan, if you want to, Jonathan, we wanted to hear from DHHL.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Aloha mai kākou. Can you hear me? Mahalo, I’ve been monitoring the meeting via YouTube so I caught almost the entirety of the discussion, but this also happens to be the day the Hawaiian Homes Commission meets so I apologize for not being on Zoom the whole time. I really appreciate the Commission having this informational briefing and the contributions of the parties to bring the Commission up to speed on this admittedly very complex issue because they’re trying to figure out what to do during these circumstances. I want to sort of start off by sharing DHHL’s interest in this which may not be known to all of the Commissioners. We have about 6,000 acres of land on the slopes above the Manā plane, they are some of the original lands that were set aside in the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act in 1921. For the majority of the century that the Department has had these lands, they were actually at first leased out by the Department of Land Natural Resources and its predecessors rather than the Department of Hawaiian Homelands, which didn’t have the authority of lands, weren’t directly being used for homesteading. Some of the lands were being irrigated from these streams and operated by the Kekaha Sugar Company which then paid some lease revenue, some of which went to the Hawaiian Homes Commission. In 1962, a beneficiary on the island of Kauaʻi, Jo Manini, approached the Hawaiian Homes Commission saying we’d like to actually see some of these lands homesteaded and in ‘62, the first request was met with, we talked about it but there’s no water that’s available for homesteading in this area, we’re not going to allow your requests. He was very persistent. By 1971, he actually secured a lease to a pastoral lot at the very top of the DHHL land, five pastoral lots were issued and actually then fights commenced immediately that same year with the Kekaha Sugar Company over whether or not there was sufficient water available for those homesteading lands. Nevertheless, the Manini family has persisted on operating cattle on some of those lands and have struggled to maintain a sort of sufficient flow of water just for those bare homesteading uses. In prior to actually the petition to amend the interim instream flow standards for the four streams that are in discussion here, the Department was actually preparing as authorized under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, a reservation request and demand for water to make our lands in that area available, but then Earthjustice on behalf of Pōʻai Wai Ola filed their own petition for interim flow standard amendments. We participated in the subsequent negotiations and we signed the Waimea Watershed Agreement in part because we received assurances in that process from KIUC that immediately and during the construction process and with the ultimate design and buildout of the full project, during that entire time we were assured our existing homesteaders would get water and in addition, our future homesteaders would get water in the course of implementing the Waimea Watershed Agreement. We went through our own environmental review process, beneficiary designation, consultation process, developed a homesteading plan for our lines around [inaudible] and spent a lot of money investing that which was going to be made possible by the implementation phase two of the project. To move up till the events now is sort of where things started to fall apart and KIUC indicated that it wasn’t going to be pursuing the project as planned. Immediately prior to your January meeting, we got contacted by KAA and by immediately prior, I mean like the night they reached out to us, the weekend before we had a chance to talk to them the afternoon before and I had a chance to talk to staff at DHHL for 15 minutes before the Water Commission meeting. We understood from KA at that time and so testified that we were told that if the KIUC modifications went in as planned, there would be possibly 30% to 50% of the time where our existing leasees, so the Kekaha Homestead Association around Puʻu ʻŌpae as well as the Maninis above them would not have any water from the system. That gave us concern and we asked the Commission to sort of pause on approving the proposed plan from KIUC based on the information that we had at that time. Our understanding now, having participated fully in all the discussions among the parties, that many of the parties have referred to today, that the issue of DHHL’s existing beneficiaries being able to get water to its lands are less a matter of whether KIUC’s design is preferable to KAA’s design, but actually that in essence the current instream flow standards which were approved by this Commission as part of the settlement may now as we’ve seen in other interim instream flow standards set across the state even a few years ago, things are much drier and you can’t actually meet the stream flow standards at the same time as providing for other off stream uses. Our concern is that we want at a minimum, our existing home stayers to be able to get the water that they need now. I think it’s our understanding that that is better served over the long term with KAA’s design. As the system operator, they can better assure us that they’ll be able to deliver water from our beneficiaries with their design than with KIUC’s design. Where we stand right now as we participate in discussions, we continue to be very interested in discussions, we want to partner and see whether or not an amicable solution among all the parties can be reached, but if an amicable solution can’t be reached, we would like the Water Commission to step in and give direction to the parties to make sure that the public trust uses both instream and off stream from the system [inaudible]. I hope that’s useful in terms of what the [inaudible].",0,C2,05/21/2024
"The path forward, is it logical to, moving on Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani’s comment, to really have our staff, you, look at the scope of work that makes sense for fulfilling the phase one agreement? Not that we want to do that, but we want to really nail that work, that scope of work down and then once it’s nailed down, submit it to the parties to then bid. KAA has already bid, KIUC is free to get their own independent cost, secondly we can quantify the amount of KIUC’s obligation. Then you could treat that as money, KAA and CWRM can then look at to say, okay what is the best use of these funds? Break this down into three things, 1) this is what is the scope required to fulfill, for KIUC to fulfill their phase one obligation, 2) what is the cost of that and the parties may be very different on that and so that may not be an easy number to agree upon, and then thirdly, how do we use it? Does that make sense?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I don’t think we’re too far away from understanding the scope. I think there are some parts of the KAA project that are beyond the scope that KIUC doesn’t agree with, that’s fine. I think the biggest question mark is the cost of implementing the KIUC project.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Maybe step one is simple, not too much and step two is going to be gnarly because the parties, but right now KIUC needs to come up with their own independent bids so that they have a number to compare to KAA’s. Again, it’s not to implement but to get the money to then figure out, okay what could you do with that that really makes sense- that’s not wasteful and duplicative and so forth and it really is used for the priority needs.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Suppose all of that goes through without a hitch and then we issue a permit, but there’s still the issue of since everybody seems to be heading toward the better design by KAA, it’s still the issue of whether they get a permit or apply for a permit or not, there’s still going to be a long delay until we have the implementation. I’m not just talking about procurement, but if you don’t have the money, you can’t go out no matter what we do and no matter what the agreement is. We’re still looking at years.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I would say that KAA can move quite rapidly with money in hand. They already have most of the elements of what they want to implement designed and or they have a manufacturer that has already built these things for them because they have implemented the parts of the agreement that addressed the Kekaha Ditch system already. So, they have the gates, the monitoring equipment, the modifications. They’ve already procured them. They have the experience, they have the...",0,C2,05/21/2024
But also heard KAA saying that they would need more money beyond what would be a fair assessment of what KIUC’s.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"No, I don’t I think that...",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Wait, wait, wait, I want to hear KAA answer that, not you.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Based on our estimate, KIUC’s project would cost more than what we want to do, so what we have to wait on and what we have to get legislative funding on really just depends on what is KIUC’s contribution and I think our perspective is that provided we can get the all of the parties to agree, whatever that number is, we would proceed forward on that basis. So, if the number is big enough that we can build everything, great. If the number is even what they originally offered, we came up with, well what does that scenario look like? The amount of work that would need to be deferred really depends on how big the check is really at the end of the day.",0,C2,05/21/2024
You can get started but you don’t know when you would finish.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"I also heard Ayron, you say CWRM, you’ve got some capacity to do some of the monitoring.",0,C2,05/21/2024
That’s just a very small part of the bigger picture.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"But we move forward, we get off the merry go round here and we start to take a step forward and you don’t get there in the first step, but it’s forward motion.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I would urge KIUC, as part of the discussions to recognize, I totally understand you’re at this point, you’re not going to build the larger project, but eight years have passed or six, seven years have passed and just to be collaborative. I also heard Dawn say you’re going to look at their numbers because I think the starting point of $500,000, there may need to be movement on that but now you can look at actual numbers to come up with a better both cost estimate. I am wondering what kind of conversations you are all having in these settlement discussions when I’m hearing some of you say for the first time you’re hearing new information at this meeting. This really shouldn’t be the meeting that you’re hearing new information, you guys should be engaging in genuine discussion. We would urge you, it sounds like there’s been some good sort of summary of next steps by both Aurora and Neil for you all to take into consideration and we would urge you, I think Larry’s comment about time is of the essence. We do need to move on, so it is going to be incumbent upon the parties to try to move quickly on this and because we are expecting the matter to come back to the Water Commission in a timely fashion.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Thank you to the Commissioners and the board and Chair. I think those three steps, I think step one is taking care of we have the 2018 plan that everybody agreed to already and the scope of that plan and if the steps two and three are the steps that the parties here agree upon, then we can take that back to our board and see if we can move forward there. I think the part of the issue is we’ve had three or four paths going and not sure which one we’re doing and KIUC is kind of taking a backseat to that because we’re not going to be long term here, but if that’s the path I think that’s helpful for us moving forward and getting some kind of resolution.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Elena, do you have anything else you want to add before we close this?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"No, it sounds like a good plan moving forward and I appreciate Commission for your guidance and help on this.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Jonathan, you have anything else?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Just to add, I think I neglected to say that the issue of whether the instream flow standards are sufficient or can be met at the same time as meaning DHHL’s off stream uses are a function of the level of the instream flow standards as well as whether or not improvements are made to Puʻu Lua Reservoir. Under the proposed project Puʻu Lua was going to be improved and so there was more storage so you could divert more during high flow periods, store it, and provide for that. That’s the other sort of moving factor that affects how you balance out ultimately the Commission meeting instream flow standards and meeting off stream public trust uses. I really appreciate the discussion.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I’d just like to say thank you to the Commission for really having the patience to work through what is a very complicated issue. I think we all want what’s best for the state in the long run and unfortunately a lot of those issues are not simple, as I’m sure you guys are very well aware, so I appreciate that.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Fair enough and I guess for me, our IIFS in 2018 was based upon a certain set of facts. Have those changed? I’m hearing Jonathan so I’m sure you guys are considering all of that as well. Time makes a difference. Last opportunity before I close this item.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I guess my only question is our next meeting we have scheduled with the group is I believe May 29th, with the mediation group. Do we want to put a deadline of the next Commission meeting?",0,C2,05/21/2024
"One comment, in my past life when I actually worked, in situations where people deferred making decisions because they wanted more information, that’s really a wrong approach to do it. I hope that whatever happens in what’s been decided, there’s some conclusion fairly quickly. I don’t want to come back again and hear that, well we don’t know, we need more information.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I think we should target for the next meeting and then if we give you two months, everybody will wait till the end of this first month. Let’s anticipate everybody that we’d come back within the next meeting which is scheduled for June 18th and that there is some better understanding based upon the recommendations by the Commission so that we’ve got some ability to either get good information or make decisions on the permits.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"Hopefully you get the scope issue, that’s easy to get behind us real quick and you’re going to have two numbers either KIUC will still have their same number or they’ll have another number that’s more informed and so then you’ll see the gap. But we won’t be arguing about scope, one thing will be done.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"This is just for the permits, whether or not they act on it, just to keep them viable and that long process of all the permits that they went through. Hopefully that provides impetus for the working group to find a solution that works for everyone sooner.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"To move this forward, Dawn, you folks can start lining up who it is you’re going to use as a consultant to give you some numbers, some cost figures. Once you take another look at the scope that can be done right now, you can start moving on that, getting that entity lined up.",0,C2,05/21/2024
You’re talking to KIUC?,0,C2,05/21/2024
You guys should all be talking about apples and apples.,0,C2,05/21/2024
"I will need to talk with KIUC about this. How they would normally do that is go through a procurement process which is somewhere between three to four months, that is how they typically get bids. They are regulated by the Public Utilities Commission and they do have a procurement process, so I will need to talk with them about how we would go about developing cost estimates and what our options are to be within their procurement rules, but I will follow up on that.",0,C2,05/21/2024
"I don’t think we’re necessarily asking KIUC to procure it, it’s just to get an estimate.",0,C2,05/21/2024
I’m sure they’ve got a series of consultants that they may have on board. We will leave that up to you guys.,0,C2,05/21/2024
Update on Water Resources in the Lahaina Aquifer Sector Area a. Wells in the Fire-Impacted Area b. Interim Instream Flow Standards c. Water Management Area and Water Use Permit Applications d. Water Resource Alternatives,0,B2,10/24/2023
Deputy Kaleo Manuel and Dr. Ayron Strauch,0,B2,10/24/2023
"Staff presented the Commission an update on surface and groundwater resources in the Lahaina Aquifer Sector. They shared data, photos of relevant wells and streams, the number of permit applications received, and further information on water alternatives like recycled water (R1).",0,B2,10/24/2023
Do your recommendations represent best practice or just minimal triage?,0,B2,10/24/2023
"That's a great question. In conversations with our survey team, it's triage but it's best practice. In general we hope that there would be some kind of protection of well source across the board. I don't know if Ryan wants to add anything from our Groundwater team. He is here on Zoom, but at minimum these are the minimum recommendations I think at this time staff are recommending for the well owners to pursue.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"Just for my understanding, of all of these wells the only one that's currently being used is Lahaina Shaft A, is that correct?",0,B2,10/24/2023
That's correct based on staff's understanding.,0,B2,10/24/2023
And is that for non-potable use?,0,B2,10/24/2023
"I just want to put out there, given the conversations about groundwater, maybe including the possibility of these providing monitoring points could be potentially used for [inaudible].",0,B2,10/24/2023
"These recommended actions for each of these wells, is there a time table or some kind of point where the owners need to make a decision on which way they're going to go with each of these wells? And is there a sense of urgency at least on the basal line to ensure that the underground water system is free of contamination or the effect of that contamination?",0,B2,10/24/2023
"That's a great question. I'm hoping Ryan's online to jump in. This is Survey Branch’s assessment. We wanted to present this to the Commission before we addressed or directed any of these recommendations to the land owners and well owners to make these improvements. The goal is to get these improvements done as soon as possible based on potential threat to the resource. Whether or not there's further formal action and or ordering by the Commission to take action on these things is something that we need to pursue and consider with Chair, but at this point we wanted to just present our initial findings and recommendations to the body and then talk about and discuss what are some of the next steps in terms of time frame. What is a time frame that we would want to see these actions completed by?",0,B2,10/24/2023
"As a permit holder though, you would think that there's some fiduciary responsibility to protect the resource immediately and then they can make the decision on do they want to maintain the permit and the water usage or [inaudible]. But I think at a minimum we need to protect the resource.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"I think staff agree. Half of it is just trying to get that work done. Let's just throw this out there for discussion, there's been conversations about us as a regulator seeing something that potentially poses a potential threat. Right now, we don't have any authority or funding or staff to actually seal it and then collect later, just in order to protect the resource. That is something that we could pursue but, right now we want to work with the private land owners and our well owners to manage and maintain these sources so that way they aren't contaminated.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"Other than Anae joining the team for the survey, has there been conversation with DOH because it sort of falls within their responsibilities to make sure there's no contamination. I want to also maybe strongly recommend that in addition to potentially sealing that access to that as a monitoring point be maintained because people are concerned about contamination. So, having access to data, having negative results will help people feel more comfortable moving forward and we don't want to seal off the ability to get us samples.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"That's a great recommendation if we can include that into our monitoring program. That might be an opportunity to analyze that. We’ve had some initial conversations with DOH in the interim. I'm looking to staff because I haven't been here, but we do need to follow up with them on water quality coordination throughout this region.",0,B2,10/24/2023
I think having their input on whatever recommendations would be really important and maybe provide the public some sense that we are coordinating on our side.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"I had some experience with shafts like this in the past and it seems to me that given the events that we've encountered that a serious inspection of these well shafts should take place. You should have divers down there swimming those shafts and have water samples taken. That should be the responsibility of the owner of those to complete that, deliver that within a reasonable time frame. In addition to that rather than just temporary covers for these open shafts, I think the owner should be responsible for preparations reasonable and permanent covers as well. I don't know if this Commission has the power to order that. I would suspect that the Department of Health certainly does but we got to try that and get that moving. First discussion would be with the owners to discuss the feasibility of getting those done.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"Kaleo, can you remind me who are the owners of these various wells?",0,B2,10/24/2023
"There's the slide deck, sorry can you pull that up? I don't have a memorized. There are multiple landowners for these current wells.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"I do believe that under the debris removal by FEMA, they are looking at some of these...I'm not sure, Dean. Did we provide them the update on these shafts to FEMA as part of the debris removal? I mean to the extent that we can get them to help pay for some of this. Have we had some coordination with them?",0,B2,10/24/2023
We did provide the information but we haven’t heard anything yet.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"Okay. Only recently FEMA also recently agreed to pay for water quality monitoring in ocean waters so, we have been trying to bring these matters to their attention. They've been very cooperative so, I think this is one that we'll continue to monitor with the owners. We're trying to utilize all available resources as Kalo said. We don't have the capacity or the money but, I think it is appropriate that during the debris removal to actually include this as part of the scope of their work.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"It just seems like the Commission is of one mind in encouraging and demanding really that the owners act with urgency; that we're looking at triage in the short term but best practice in the long term, not kapulu work. This is an important resource we're protecting and three, that we're looking at a need for commitment to ongoing monitoring.",0,B2,10/24/2023
Mahalo for that. We will follow up with that right away.,0,B2,10/24/2023
Thank you. This is not an action item but a good update and I think the Commission's inclinations have provided the staff a good direction upon which to work with both DOH and FEMA on potential resources as well as the landowners.,0,B2,10/24/2023

What’s the elevation of that storage?,0,B2,10/24/2023
"1,600 feet, I think?",0,B2,10/24/2023
Why can't we do both?,0,B2,10/24/2023
We are definitely suggesting the county go all in on multiple fronts.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"On the option one, does it include land acquisition cost or some kind of compensation process?",0,B2,10/24/2023
"Definitely some of the reservoirs are potentially on private lands. The Field 140 Reservoir is owned by Maui Land and Pine, but the Wahikuli Reservoir is owned by the State. There are other end uses that could utilize the R1 system that have reservoirs available to take the water. They wouldn't necessarily be owned by the county, but I would say that the biggest cost would be engineering and procurement of materials to run the pipeline for seven or eight miles.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"So, the $30-$40 million does not include any acquisition cost?",0,B2,10/24/2023
"No, it does. It’s an estimate.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"If you were to exclude the land acquisition cost, what would that be?",0,B2,10/24/2023
If I remember correctly only about $2 million was allocated to land acquisition.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"Ayron, did we know whether in talking to the county, the county was considering using any FEMA funds for this, either of these options?",0,B2,10/24/2023
I can't speak for the county.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"No, fair enough, fair enough. I don't know if there's a county representative here, but Eva. Sorry to catch you off guard. Did you want to come up and respond? Thank you for being here. You want to provide us any update on any of these two options?",0,B2,10/24/2023
"Yes, it was actually our CIP engineer that provided the cost estimates with Ayron on that. I'm just familiar with the concepts of them. It does include the land acquisition costs. We have a long kind of wish list for FEMA reimbursement that include a lot of alternative resource exploration including desal and expansion of recycled water. We provided that before the cost estimate for these, but they do overlap. I'm not sure, ultimately what solution is going to benefit the community. There's so many different ways of doing this. It’s definitely one of the options for FEMA.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"I greatly appreciate the county concerns. I think we're really looking to support the county, not necessarily to take the lead, but whatever we can do to provide you support for this.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"When we designated this as a Water Management Area, there was some objection that we shouldn't. Do you see anything in the data that you disclose that should give us reason to reconsider our decision? Let me answer the question. I only see greater interest in doing so. Is that a correct analysis of your data?",0,B2,10/24/2023
"Yes. There's less water, the pie has shrunk.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"Eva, you were amongst those who opposed designation, as I recall. Do you still hold that position or you think we're on the right track here?",0,B2,10/24/2023
"[inaudible] That was the county’s position, too, who brought that to the Commission. I did feel there was an opportunity there for more collaboration up front that we should have provided that. But ultimately the end result is a very equitable sharing of the resources and we certainly need Commission’s expertise to do it. I’m signed up for oral testimony, too.",0,B2,10/24/2023
We'd actually let you come up to the front of the list if you want to testify.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"My question might also be addressed by Eva and it has to do with the water recycling situation. I don't know if I want to know the answer for this, but given sort of rising concerns about emerging contaminants and the proposed use of like R1 for agriculture. I'll just say specifically like growing concerns about PFAS. Is that something on the radar of this kind of initiative, to utilize wastewater recycling and the degree to which it might need to be treated if it's going to be used potentially for agriculture. I don't know if that's to Ayron or to you, so just put it there.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"I can take a stab at it. When we have proposed strategies to use R1, it has been for non-edible crops such as energy crops. I think that's something that has to be scrutinized further by DOH before we know for certain what crops are compatible with R1.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"DOH does heavily regulate the use of R2, R1, and R0 water and the way that they require you to meet specific standards for crops that are like grow crops, for example. They heavily scrutinize those systems so there's already a mechanism in place to regulate recycled water water quality.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"In County, where groundwater is sort of captured and that's in ʻĪao Valley if I'm correct and that water is not treated [inaudible] as potable water. Is that feasible and what are the issues involved in that you certified etc. You could do that on the left side as well.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"It depends, I guess. If it's considered groundwater under direct influence of surface water, it would probably require additional treatment. It can’t go through the ditch, it would have to be... So yes we had hoped that if we are pursuing that that would be considered a ground water and not [inaudible].",0,B2,10/24/2023
"From an implementation standpoint of turning on the water, of the two strategies what kind of timeline would you estimate for option one and option two?",0,B2,10/24/2023
I don't think a timeline has been specifically discussed.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"Sort of looking at the legal hurdles, you're looking at the physical engineering. Both seem like pretty low hanging fruit. It's $2 million-$4 million just for the plumbing. One is you know, land acquisitions will probably take you a long time depending on if you have cooperating land owners. In option two what are sort of the legal thresholds or obstacles in using that pretty good source of water. I would think it's almost portable.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"I would say the either negotiating Rights of Entry or an easement is going to be critical. Especially the Honokōhau Ditch itself runs across both State and Kāʻanapali Land own parcels. Kahoma Ranch, Kamehameha Schools, for example. There are a variety of entities that need to be negotiated. I'm not an expert in land issues.",0,B2,10/24/2023
Good to understand that.,0,B2,10/24/2023
I'm assuming no discussions with private land owners.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"We've discussed the use of R1, definitely. We've had discussions dating back to 2017 on how can we take advantage of the availability of R1 to reserve groundwater for best and highest usage of drinking water supply.",0,B2,10/24/2023
Right now there been seen zero benefit in the water management analysis. Water is coming out of the tunnel...it's pure surface flow that is being deducted from the aquifer but no recharge benefit from it.,0,B2,10/24/2023
Can you repeat the question?,0,B2,10/24/2023
"Water coming out of the horizontal tunnels were deducted from the groundwater aquifer, but there was no credit given for recharge as was just flowing down the ditch. And that was pretty good quality water.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"Okay, sounds like low hanging fruit.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"I have a question on B2-B. Can we go back to that section? This is just dream stuff for Ayron. On the Kauaʻula stream flow duration with no diversions which you kind of, I sorry I don't even know what slide that is. But you were talking through the restoration and basically coming to the conclusion that it would not allow for mauka to makai connectivity. What assumptions, because you were using sort of a static assessment from the steepage runs, right? And you're making certain assumptions when you're projecting that.",0,B2,10/24/2023
The seepage runs are the estimates of seepage loss are an average of three or four values.,0,B2,10/24/2023
Taken across different points at different times of the year.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"Different times; definitely under maybe wetter conditions there might actually be more seepage loss, but at the same time the rates might change. Again, it's just an ability to superimpose a snapshot of seepage loss, an average snapshot of seepage loss at various elevations with our current understanding of flow duration values for Kauaʻula starting at the USGS gauge which is I believe at 1,560 feet in elevation. Moving from mauka to makai under medium flow, how much makes it to the siphon. How much makes it to the 230 foot elevation, how much makes it to the mouth under low flow conditions. That's the best way to present the data.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"Sure. I'm just trying to square up, too. There's strong interest in that coastal region and the way we think about IIFS has tended to be kind of mauka focused. How do we need to think about the flows in order to really center the muliwai?",0,B2,10/24/2023
"I'm not looking up mauka, I need to think about the muliwai.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"If we were to put all the water back in the stream mauka of the diversion, it's really not benefiting the muliwai most of the time because it's going to dry out. The goal is actually to release more at a lower elevation so we protect more traditional and customary practices in the valley. There's more flow at the mouth, there's more flow at the muliwai. There are increased benefits to the near shore environment.",0,B2,10/24/2023
You're saying basically that restoring flow even in the mauka areas wouldn't be a significant contribution to the basal aquifer and increased head lower down? How much do we understand about the...I think because there are different competing interpretations of what is happening in the sub-surface.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"The Kauaʻula Stream is channelized by the highway and then it's un- channelized near the mouth. If we want surface flow at the muliwai, we have to release more at a lower elevation. I also know when there was more being released at a lower elevation we did see other amphidromous species, not just the nākea that can survive at the moment, but we saw ʻoehaʻa and ʻakupa. There are other tangible benefits to getting more surface flow at a lower elevation. More species live at a lower elevation, for example. I understand that there is some unknown... there are some springs that also could benefit, but I think they are also benefiting from releasing at the lower elevation.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"If you were to think about temperature then because ground water is always going to be colder than surface water and colder water holds more oxygen. I'm just trying to wrap my head around it again not having walked it, would there be a differential effect if more water is coming through a spraying pathway then over surface because that groundwater would potentially be better for certain species. Maybe this is more a question to the community who watches this, but I'm curious what you know.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"The dozen or so times I've walked from mauka to makai and makai to mauka, the springs that are benefiting are actually far out of the stream channel. They're the ones down in Lahaina town. They're benefiting from the recharge and not necessarily springs in the stream channel. I don't know if that helps.",0,B2,10/24/2023
I think the bottom line is maybe I should try and get out there. Sometimes I can imagine it through maps.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"Did you hear Danny Palakiko’s testimony recognizing that we may be coming in with modifications of the IIFS. I know when I went not on the site visit there were concerns raised by some members of the community to put some water back into that connection point, to do that mauka - makai connection, to assist in the saturation. What I heard Danny talk about and I may be misunderstanding but wanting to take a pause on our modifications. What's your thought about that?",0,B2,10/24/2023
"There was 3.5 cfs in the stream about an hour and a half ago. That is what we are proposing to put in the stream at the siphon. I mean yes you can put it in the stream way up mauka but that's actually less that is available for the kalo farmers in the valley. If you want to do that, it will recharge. That's a benefit, but ultimately that's less water that's available for the lower elevation instream uses.",0,B2,10/24/2023
I think this is the second time we've see these options in the context of informational briefings. what's the critical path going forward? when do we see these as actionable items?,0,B2,10/24/2023
I don't choose the agenda.,0,B2,10/24/2023
What more work needs to be put into this to make it an item that is properly in form for action?,0,B2,10/24/2023
"I am comfortable with the data that are available. It is an interim solution, we can change it in a year.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"I'll step in...I think that the site visit, the information that Aaron came up with I think there is some level of comfort in trying to bring this back to the commission for decision as soon as November.

"Lucienne had suggested that there's going to be a need to sort of convene different entities. In your written testimony it was saying DWS is willing to take the lead on...sorry director is saying DWS is willing to take the lead on this effort. You also mentioned and correct me if I'm wrong that DWS has submitted water use applications, including also for Maui Land and Pine? It was the first thing you said and I want to make sure I caught it correctly.",0,B2,10/24/2023
We have submitted existing use water use permit applications for all the sources that are used by our customers whether we own that source or not. They may be actually competing with Maui Land and Pine because Maui Land and Pine may own the source and they are submitting water use permits for their end uses.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"Okay, this is where I'm going to learn how water use permit applications work and who submits it and who is standing. Where do you see the convergence of that conversation because my understanding...I'm on Oʻahu and Honolulu Board of Water Supply has great PR and seem to have very good relationships with the public. It's a very different system situation on Maui where there's multiple private purveyors and maybe people trust or don't trust Maui DWS. What do you see as important conversations and I'm remembering you didn't oppose designation, but DWS was requesting deferral because of the need to collaborate. Now, the landscape literally has changed, but people are wanting to come together. Where is that conversation? Who hosts it, your opinion and you can decline if you think it's appropriate. Who needs to be there and if you guys have had any visions because the water use development plan that we approved is now very different looking.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"I can speak to that and that was one of the ideas that we think we tried and failed with board designation. Even throughout the public process of the one-year development plan would really get more of a collaboration between the larger private purveyors and stakeholders and large land owners to kind of fix this on a home basis and that didn't work out. I think there's still opportunity to do that and that's why we put that in testimony, too. It would build on Ayron Strauch’s initiative with a West Maui working group that he started in 2018 or even 2017. I was at those early meetings. Where you know best scenario if we can both come to collaborate on those comprehensive water resource strategies. Does it involve every major land owner, Department of Environmental Management who manage recycle water, us, etc. If even that effort could be some of the compromises to avoid a contested case, that would be great because we've been through a couple of those decade-long ones everywhere else. That's something I was worried about with estimation that that's going to be delayed and just developing needed source for the existing community in West Maui. Who would be at the table? I mean I'm not going to say, but I think it would build on the initiative that Ayron Strauch started which was the major water purveyors, large land owners, folks from Honokōhau Valley. We've been busy since the fire, so honestly this is something we talked about earlier and haven't really come to it yet. But I know our director has spoken to some of the key folks and we're willing to lead efforts. And I think CWRM staff needs to be involved because this will also help the water use permit process coming to some agreements that would make these comprehensive water resource strategies actually work.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"If I can come from my standpoint as a chair of the Water Commission, I would greatly appreciate it if...we’re the regulators. We're ultimately going to have to review all the water permit applications. So my preference is that the county is leading that charge, that the county is coordinating with the community, all of the different stakeholders. Clearly, CWRM staff will participate but to avoid because we will be the ones who ultimately approve any permits. Again, I look at my lane. My lane is we’re the regulators. You guys came up with a really good plan. I know council member staff down in West Maui...I'm sorry East Maui. That was a really good community engagement process I thought. If you could duplicate that with West Maui and try to bring as many of these stakeholders together. I don't know if we could ever totally avoid a contested case hearing or lawsuit, but I think if so much of what I'm hearing is rebuilding trust or building trust. I'd like to believe we had some trust at one time, but nonetheless it would be very helpful for us collectively as government entities if we are investing in that Community engagement process. I would greatly appreciate it if the county would indeed take that lead and I think there's a really nice leadership right now in the county to spearhead that. If I walk away with anything from here today, I convey that to you, thank you.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"I was going to ask you, are you planning to revisit the West Maui Water Use and Development Plan? That would be sort of the vehicle to rebuild and recast moving forward what you've heard in the last two sessions here, I would think. But is there a plan to do that?",0,B2,10/24/2023
"It wasn't anything that was budgeted and prioritized until we finalized the ongoing efforts. We’re updating the Molokaʻi Water Use and Development Plan and we're supposed to do Lānaʻi after that. We’re not going to tackle an island-wide plan like that ever again as long as I’m alive. Of course, the priority area would be West Maui. So what format? I know that Kaleo folks are working on revamping this framework, so it may be very different how that will be done. I think nevertheless we have an already outdated water use development plan. Some of those water resource strategies are still very relevant. They are the ones we're still talking about today, maximizing R1 use and distributing ground water, the portfolio and all that stuff. I don't know if it's going to be a joint effort with the Department of Planning and more community driven because we don't have any directive of how this rebuild of Lahaina is going to look like. We don't know. It's a very good question and I can’t answer how that's going to be done and when, but I think it's going to look very different than what we presented to you a year ago.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"Again, I’m sorry. It provides a vehicle and provides a reason to build a consensus group. At least what you've heard in the last two sessions here from the community and sort of incorporate that in your water development.",0,B2,10/24/2023
"I might, you mentioned dual water systems and that's been something that I've always been very interested in. Kapalua is a dual system and the obvious disadvantage is the capital cost of having two sets of pipes, two sets of meters, two sets of water storage, etc. But once that capital cost is put in place, the operating efficiencies are tremendous and the users, for example Kapalua started out on non-potable irrigation for about 70% of consumption in the water rate there was about one-half of the potable water rate and the size of the water treatment plants from the portable water storage etc. It ended up being I think a system that was highly desirable. Longwinded way of asking a question. Is there a possibility that the county could step-wise perhaps move in that direction, converting geographical areas to a dual system? You'd have to spend a lot of time to add it, but does it make sense? The frontend capital cost you think the County of Maui...",0,B2,10/24/2023
"Now, it's an opportunity because for FEMA reimbursement or for any federal fund reimbursement. Now as in term of response required you're going to have to first move the damage which would require all this testing. So, you can't recommission this particular water service lateral. We can leave it in base and use that for fire protection not potable needs. I don't know, maybe my director knows, but I don't know exact costs and looking at that as the alternative of testing all the service laterals and rebuilding assets. This is certainly an opportunity to do that for West Maui, a dual system.",0,B2,10/24/2023
It is logical for the area with the geographic separateness.,0,B2,10/24/2023
"This is less of a question for Eva, but maybe I can speak to the audience. There's a really good point made that revisiting the water use development plan, the water plan is maybe something that should be highly considered given all the aspirations that were articulated and a way to bring it into a revised version. It's not the whole island’s plan but there were those chapters and to revisit, make your specific recommendations. I think that's a county level discussion with your County Council as well who are your elected representatives. They will understand and are responsive to your needs. I don't know, this is interesting because I don't know who trusts who right now on Maui. I know it's been destroyed. I'll stop talking, okay thanks.",0,B2,10/24/2023

I think I just want to echo I hear loud and clear you guys are telling us to, excuse my language do our jobs. We only have meetings monthly, but now we have a deputy kind of back and we've got some work to do internally.

"What I realized in this position of being the chairperson, part of my job is actually to show up, to be present. It is to come out to the communities that are being impacted and it's a showing of respect. After hearing everybody in the October meeting I realized I need to be present and see what Kauaʻula, this must be late in the afternoon, Kauaʻula stream. I needed to see what it was. I needed to talk to the people who are the stakeholders from that place and I was honored that they treated me with great hospitality and respect. Kāpua, she can attest, I was dehydrated and I was not feeling well, but I will tell you when I went to the Palakiko’s place, it was sort of a place of healing. I think it was the coolness of the place, but it was also the people and my body just started to feel better. It was either that or the electric lights started to fill in. Nonetheless, it was an appreciation of all of the people whose lives we touch. Decisions that we make have a meaning and impact and I think we do owe it to those people to be present. This meeting on Maui was appropriate. It was important for us to be here, to show up, to hear you. As you can see this Commission is not shy from having very long meetings. We will stay as long as we can to try to hear everybody whether you're on Zoom or whether you're in person. I greatly appreciated everybody who took the time out especially the young children who came, who spoke with great passion and obvious commitment about place. I really do appreciate everybody and there was nothing but civility here. Nothing but a desire but extreme frustration. We get it. No decisions were made today. I think it was very important for the Commission to hear from everybody. I will tell you we have the best staff. Kaleo has really provided great leadership, but the staff at CWRM, they go beyond the call. I would tell you Ayron, he's out there still going in and monitoring and doing all the work that needs to be done as is everybody else at CWRM. I don't make any guarantees to any of you, we are going to do our best. I think we've heard a lot of what the people who show up, we heard what you had to say. Our next meeting is November 21st, it's going to be back in Honolulu. We have one more meeting in December, December 19th. Again, we appreciate all of you who took the time to be with us all day to share your manaʻo, to listen to others, and to listen to what we have to share.",0,B2,10/24/2023

I can hang on.,0,C1,04/16/2024
"The short answer is where we used to do clean, inspect, repair to reinstate or reuse, now it’s clean, inspect, repair to decommission. Essentially the exact same process except for the tail end where the tank cleaning verification, which is really hey, making sure we’ve removed all product, that it’s met the regulatory expectations of, hey, the tank is now clean. Whereas before it would be hey, we would do tank tightness testing and other things so that we can place it back in service.

"Several hundred at the height of it and then you have, besides the folks that are in working throughout the tank, you also have folks running things back and forth to the port staging areas and so forth. As sludge comes out and it’s containerized, we don’t want to leave it up on the hill. We’re getting it out of there and stage it, so you’ve got lots of activity back and forth on top of ongoing regular facility maintenance that has to occur: elevators, electrical systems, legacy water system, all that routine maintenance that has to occur on an ongoing basis.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"We have rovers that will be walking to see if there’s any of the water that’s leaking or dripping out. One thing I will tell you is that, by having a team doing the prep and then moving to prep the next and move to prep and then another team comes in. Hopefully what we’re going to see is that we’re going to get some best practice and some learning so we can kind of keep those same teams, lots of sets and reps just like a good football practice or something. Then hopefully we’ll be able to garner some speed at a safe rate there. The other thing is what I’m trying to get my mind around is how do we present this to the public to show what’s going on? We do have an app so we’re trying to think, whereas Admiral Wade and the JTF could show gravity doing its thing and taking fuel down thousands...how we represent that to show the community. We’re trying to get our minds around what’s a good optic to show because it’s going to move at the speed of molasses. It’s going to be kind of slow.",0,C1,04/16/2024

"Anecdotal, but I think maybe relevant to this is in Lahaina, during both the cleanup and the recovery, they’ve hired cultural practitioners or cultural monitors and I think those monitors who are actually from Lahaina has elevated trust, sensitivity but they are actually on the ground and they are part of the team. I think that they add a level of again, credibility and I think they have an interest. Something for you to consider is utilizing that kind of quality. Something to consider.",0,C1,04/16/2024

"I have an additional thought for you on that example you gave of being stuck on a number. The question is, is that where you’re supposed to be? If you establish milestones, you’re doing a much better job of having those highlight variants. Here’s the whole plan. It’s good to refresh our memory of the whole plan, especially when it’s long term, but focus on at least one slide or somehow embed on your slides an ability to speak to key variances. Variances can be good, variances could be bad, and they should be explained. So okay, we’re behind on this goal, we’re stuck here at this number because we’re behind on this goal because of a supply chain issue or a permit issue or whatever and we expect to get this and reforecast. Then we expect to get this done and here’s the new schedule, that way it provides transparency. Right now, it’s kind of overwhelming. We see the whole plan every time, it’s a little bit overwhelming but it’s coming before us quarterly so what was it for? What did we expect to have happen from the last quarter to this quarter. Did it happen on these key lines of effort?",0,C1,04/16/2024
"You have this timeline and you just explained that on this top line that there’s potential delay because of the unexpected air quality monitoring. I think this is a lot of information. Broken down and explained a little bit more slowly, maybe you have people who are good at that for me it’s science translation, but you can do that. For engineers, you want to be efficient and provide as much information as possible in as little time as possible, but it’s drinking from a fire hose. You have some good materials. Pictures are useful, diagrams that don’t have all the complexity but the key parts. Especially for most people who’ve only seen it through a few pictures.",0,C1,04/16/2024

"It’s still the VOCs, SVOCs, but it is a slightly different list of analytes and that was what was...so back in January, we pulled together all the drinking water experts from the Navy, we pulled in public health, the Department of Health, and the EPA all together to try to figure out...really there was two things. The first task was what is causing the low-level detections and I’ll hit on that in a moment on the next slide, but what is causing those low-level detections that we saw across the entire distribution system in period seven, even? Then the second thing was to develop what is the best plan going forward for after long-term monitoring completed in March of 2024, the Navy was not done. We were going to continue what should that be and so they talked about what are all those analytes that we could add that we should change, that we should focus on that really are not applicable and we should take out of it so that we can speed up the analysis and then any methods that should be changed. I’ll talk in a minute when we talk about the low-level detections and that the quenching the sodium thiosulfate that is now part of this system and talk about the difference about method 1815 and what we’re utilizing now.",0,C1,04/16/2024
I guess I asked because I’m aware that these hydrocarbons break down and change form so they wouldn’t necessarily look the same and are you adapting those methods to that.,0,C1,04/16/2024
"And one thing that is important, one change of Extended Drinking Water Monitoring, the EDWM, is that when we do have detections in LTM, it had a list of, well first you flush, then you do this, and it kind of just laid out this is the process you follow. EDWM is a little bit more exploratory to try to figure out to where when we start to see detections, we don’t just follow a prescribed method, we actually do a lot more analysis on it. There’s a piano method and someone much more smart on chemistry that we could have explain it in the future. It’s much more diving into the science behind it, the forensics to figure out truly what could be causing those detections, not fuel related, but what else could it be and so forth. That’s kind of the focus of EDWM.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"I commend you for this effort. It’s not lost on me that you’re doing this in context of lawsuits where the nature of this work and the release of information about it could create legal exposure, and yet the public health and well-being is being put as paramount here. I note that.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"Yes, sir. We got to keep getting it right.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"I’m a lay person, but I think I understood. Was this conveyed to the community? Because I know that they were not, they had some...",0,C1,04/16/2024
"We’ve discussed this several times at FTAC, is where we really laid it all out and answered a lot of questions. We’ve also at the CRI and different forums like that we’ve had these discussions, we’ve laid it out within the military community. Captain Soho and Admiral Barnett held all of the command leaderships at the installation, brought them in, had this discussion. There is skepticism and there has been the argument, so you’re telling me you did 8,000 samples and they’re all erroneous? No, those 8,000 samples are still very, very valid and they proved what they could, but the fact that there was the noise and this chemical reaction, it doesn’t in any way invalidate that test but we just had to dig deeper to figure out what it is that was causing those low level. That was some of the concern that we have received from the public, so far. We do anticipate that as we continue to make sure all these technical documents are correct and agreed upon by the regulators and release those, we do anticipate more discussions and there are some individuals who are very passionate about it and the science is not necessarily going to matter because emotionally or physically, they are still experiencing symptoms that we can’t explain. They’re not going to believe it and we will continue to try to investigate further as well as to discuss it.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"Which is why I wanted the medical team, even though I don’t have doctors, is why I want them to explain to help these folks who are presenting with items. We’re going to have to, kind of like you’re saying, as we get final approval from Washington DC to release this, we need to have a strat rollout plan which we’re working on and how do we communicate that because like you said, some folks are engineers, some folks aren’t. How do we get that out with the videos, fact sheets, and things like that.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"Going back to the quenching issue, my understanding of this was that it would create false positives, correct? If the chlorination was causing these sort of elevated TPH detections but on the other side of it, the testimony that comes through, the complaints, people were still seeing sheens and odors. Has there been any progress in rectifying that? Sometimes it seems after someone comes back from a break and it might be in the household, has your team done a little bit more water quality focus?",0,C1,04/16/2024
"That’s why it’s important for the Water Quality Action Team, when they show up, go there and they can say, well, show us the sheen that you’re talking about. Sometimes they’ll go, well, where are you getting the water from? Well, I’m getting it from my refrigerator. But when was the filter changed? That’s when the engineers come in and we can kind of say, hey, let’s pull the records, let’s see when you’re thing...or sometimes it may be the container that they put under there that may have some film. That’s why we want the water quality expert there that can do just that.",0,C1,04/16/2024
Has that been running very long? Have you guys started to?,0,C1,04/16/2024

"We had the initial six houses that the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) did an investigation on in October and then the most recent they did 12 additional houses and most of those were identified via Facebook poll in the CRI. They weren’t even fed directly to us, they were fed to...the EPA really didn’t find anything that validated, but again, strengthened our approach of the Water Quality Action Team.",0,C1,04/16/2024

"While we didn’t come up with a lot of conclusive, we didn’t find any buildup of TPH, we didn’t find any gunk, anything that was concerning in that, but we’ll continue with efforts like that as required.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"With the medical side, too.",0,C1,04/16/2024

"Sometimes I find from DLNR, if you can believe it, not everybody trusts DLNR. Sometimes it is helpful to get some independent assessment separate and apart from DLNR as a quality assurance for communities. I know we will never change some members perceptions or understanding of it, but I think sometimes it helps having that independent assessment other than us to give some credence to the results.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"Admiral Barnett, could you put in perspective for me the efforts in the aquifer and the stability there because that affects a huge population. I know that a lot of your conversation has been focused above ground.",0,C1,04/16/2024
Drinking water. Once it’s into the system and once...,0,C1,04/16/2024
"And rightly so; however, could you put in perspective work on the monitoring of the aquifer?",0,C1,04/16/2024
"We always are very careful because we don’t want to confuse people talking about the difference between drinking water and groundwater and obviously we all know that they’re tied. Where do you get your drinking water from? It’s from the aquifer. First, all of our water continues to come from Waiawa Shaft which is six miles away, it’s not coming from the Red Hill Shaft. But at Red Hill, since the onset of the crisis and until today and as well as Admiral [inaudible].",0,C1,04/16/2024
Is there some part of the presentation that will [inaudible].,0,C1,04/16/2024
"We actually for today’s presentation, we weren’t intending to go deep into remediation so I’ll talk just a couple minutes on that if that’s fine.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"Within the remediation of the Red Hill Shaft, we do continue to maintain the Capture Zone which I’ll talk about on the next slide as required in the Red Hill Shaft Remediation Plan, was the plan that was developed at the onside of the crisis with the regulators and the Navy, again, which was the strategy for how we were going to recover the water quality of the aquifer. We continue to move forward that and maintain the Capture Zone and I’ll talk about the water that continues to be pumped into the stream in our efforts to try to reduce that. In addition to the Capture Zone, we continue to, like the WAI report had many great recommendations, many of which we’re already doing and will continue to do. Monitoring wells, we continue to drill monitoring wells and sample those on a regular basis to gain as much information as possible about any movement of contamination, any new spikes or like after we had the rain event over the last few days, I do expect we’re going to have some unusual results as it may have freed up any pockets. Any major rain events, we’ll see something unusual from time to time. So monitoring wells, the soil vapor, we continue to monitor soil vapor underneath all of the tanks, continue to expand the groundwater monitoring wells. I think some of your folks are part of the discussions, the SME (subject matter experts) level discussions where we’re trying to identify new locations where we can drill monitoring wells, working with Ernie Lau and Erwin on what those locations are for actual recovery. We’ve removed a lot of the soil, we talked about pilots that we’re interested in doing. We are actually right now kicking off the soil vapor extraction pilot to where we’ve got the equipment that is now set up. They’re doing some of the last walkthroughs this week with the intent of next week that system becomes operational. That’s where we are pushing air into areas that we believe through all of the characterization we’ve done, we’ve identified some places that we believe there’s some fuel that’s trapped, pushing air in. At the same time, we’re sucking air out and to try to pull anything that’s trapped. That’s just one pilot, we actually did get the letter this morning that’s the regulators had approved our natural source zone depletion study where we’re continuing to look at what can we do to increase the bugs eating the fuel that might be trapped in there. Do we add heat, do we add oxygen? What are those things that we can do to increase the consumption of any contamination. The site assessment that’s going on right now is part of looking at Red Hill as a whole facility. We’ve had a lot of focus following the 2014 releases and the 2021 releases at Adit 3 as well as the tank farm, but let’s look at Red Hill as an entire facility and right now the site assessment is being and developed. The work plan that looks at the history of the facility, where releases may have occurred, where other facilities used to lay, where there’s any potential risk in all of the areas that we need to sample and study to develop the complete comprehensive remediation plan for Red Hill. That’s being worked with the regulators right now. By this summer, June is when our first work plan is going to be submitted to them and the site assessment, while we wish it was a super quick, it’s going to take several years. It’ll identify additional sampling that’s required and then remediation focus in certain areas. As Admiral Williams mentioned, that remediation will continue for many years at Red Hill and the Navy remains committed to that. I’m not sure if that hit on any details, I’ll hit more on the Capture Zone here in a second.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"Well, that’s the critical infrastructure item for the entire island and the civilian population that relies on that water source.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"And one very important one that I failed to mention was the modeling that is occurring. There are two different models that are in effort, the Navy is working on our groundwater model to identify where we believe that any flow or any contamination from the past has gone as well as any future and the University of Hawaiʻi working their independent model, but we’re supporting them. Two different models are still in progress that will help inform what happens subsurface, where is the aquifer, where is it flowing.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"That would be helpful, Admiral Barnett, maybe at the next update if you can focus on the remediation because to me, that’s our lane. I am also aware of the Red Hill WAI report and that report was not intended to supersede or circumvent in any way the existing regulators, DOH and EPA, but it was looking at approaches to accelerate remediation because just letting it sit for the next 30 years is probably not acceptable. But opening up Red Hill Shaft, that raises a lot of questions. What impact does that have? I think it would be really helpful to focus on that because to me, that is really key for CWRM.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"Thank you, Commissioner Katayama for bringing us back to our focus and your encouragement that that should be a key part of the report to us. I get you reporting to another audience, maybe they’re less interested in that, but for us it’s pretty key.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"My understanding was you have both groundwater model and the contaminant fate and transport model. Is that the one you’re also referring to? There’s two, [inaudible].",0,C1,04/16/2024
"The fate and contaminate transport will come later. We’re still tracking to get the groundwater model, September 2024 is when we’re tracking to have that complete but it’s not going to be as much of that more 3D. The fate and transport model, that will come after that, we’ll continue to work on. It’s all part of the groundwater modeling effort, but deliverables will come in various stages of completion. The September one is not going to be the complete fate and transport model.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"Given the monitoring wells, it seems like the whole release could provide basically a tracer in some sense to shape and inform the contaminate fade and transport model, which my understanding was the DOH has some of these back in 2023, had a lot of comments and they were being addressed.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"They are being addressed as well as the University of Hawaiʻi that there will be a tracer study that we’re working with them on to actually put tracers in, and let’s get a real tracer complete analysis. Unfortunately, that’s not as quick as we would all love. It takes a little bit more time, but there will be a tracer study as part of the University of Hawaiʻi’s effort.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"I’ve mentioned this before especially for more on the DLNR side, having better, for CWRM as well, monitoring of nearshore waters. What impact if anything are we seeing? And we need some good baseline, but we don’t have the resources to install some of those monitoring devices for nearshore waters or streams, just to see what impacts it may have on the ecosystem far beyond drinking water, ground water.",0,C1,04/16/2024
I think right now the only stream that we’re monitoring is the Hālawa Stream [inaudible].,0,C1,04/16/2024

Because I’d like to have our Division of Forestry and Wildlife who does watershed protection as well as our Division of Aquatic Resources who has interest in water quality. I think those need to be part of the conversation from a DLNR standpoint.,0,C1,04/16/2024

"As we mentioned, I know that Captain Sohaney, the Base Installation Commander, he’s briefed the Commission in the past. I know that he is always working at Admiral Barnett’s direction, water conservation measures across the base, understand that the pumping compliance, the 15 million gallons that we have at the Waiawa Shaft, measures that have been fairly effective to reduce the consumption to where we are right now, right at that rolling average.

"I just wanted to offer this, perhaps a hint or a piece of information that might be beneficial. Had some experience with diesel spills, light end product spills in Maui and also on Oʻahu in the past. One of the bets being as old as I am, as you look back and see mistakes people made in different perspective, but by way of a couple of hints. On Maui, small-scale spill of diesel into a sandy soil aquifer, was only about 30 feet down. Two things seemed to work in terms of remediating the aquifer and the soil’s condition. One is removing the soil, sending it to Arkansas and having it baked for a while to get rid of it that way. The other is skimming and the only thing that worked in terms of remediation of the water effectively was skimming, even pumping from a foot down, two feet down, five feet down into the aquifer was ineffective, relatively, because of the floating nature of the product especially a light end product like JP5. Secondly, there was another incident a larger, I believe it was in Wahiawa. It was Del Monte, it was a fuel truck that was fueling agricultural equipment several thousand gallons were spilled and they had a very similar problem. It was in a more perhaps comparable position, too, and you’ve got much more difficult circumstances, the depth of the aquifer, soils’ conditions are not uniform. But those were two areas that seem to be most effective at remediating those groundwater spills.",0,C1,04/16/2024

"Chair, may I ask maybe Dean or Ryan to look at the aquifer and sustainable yield with what the Navy is doing, what the Board of Water Supply is doing, the restoration of Red Hill, Hālawa and just look at context of the pressures that we’re seeing on that aquifer and the sense of urgency of restoring that Red Hill as a long-term source of water supply? I think that would help and put in context with what Captain Sullivan has just described to us.",0,C1,04/16/2024
"I know we didn’t talk about it today but the Navy Aiea Hālawa Shaft, we also are working efforts for the reactivation of that shaft in the near future to include right now the installation of the same GAC technology we’re utilizing at Red Hill to where it is the charcoal but also a final tank that includes PFAS. The construction of that actually began this week so temporary facility, temporary treatment in order for us to push to reactivate Navy Aiea Hālawa Shaft to ease the burden of the aquifer in other areas.",0,C1,04/16/2024

"Department of Defense Updates on the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility Defueling, Remediation and Closure, Red Hill Shaft Recovery and Monitoring, and Monitoring Well Development and Water Data",0,C1,11/21/2023
"MajGen Hashimoto, VADM John Wade (Joint Task Force-Red Hill), RDML Steve Barnett (Navy Region Hawaiʻi), RDML Jeff Kilian (Navy Facilities Engineering Systems Command-Pacific) The presenters briefed the Commission on defueling, conditions for closure, and environmental remediation initiatives currently in effect.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"As you complete your mission, will you be preparing any kind of final report that will be transition or also publicly available about what you accomplished during the defueling?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Yes, at the end we will certainly put together a final report. There will be an internal DOD final report but also a publicly facing document. One of the key things coming out of the 2021 situation was transparency and we have again done our very best to be as transparent as possible. I think there's a lot of lessons learned here that can be applied not only to the Navy Closure Task Force but also Hawaiʻi and the remainder of the Pacific and quite honestly when it comes to environmental stewardship and the importance to connect with the public and the community which supports the military. The symbiotic relationship I believe, there's lessons to be learned globally with all of our facilities that we have in supporting our national defense.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"It's good to hear that the personnel will transition, 15 to 20. What percent of your team is that? It’s going to be a smaller team for closure.",0,C1,11/21/2023
Admiral Barnett can talk to it. He has the slides and the composition of his team.,0,C1,11/21/2023
"The other question I had or maybe observation is in your dialogues with community, the Navy has a certain definition of closure and you're trying to articulate that here but is it congruent? And where is it different from the public's perception of what the word closure means and looks like?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"That's a fair point and I'm going to defer that to Admiral Barnett since he's one, responsible for it but the other piece to it because I don't want to just leave that hanging right is that there's a lot of uncertainty for closure because there are still unknowns with respect to what the facility will turn into or become. There is a National Defense Authorization Act to do a beneficial reuse study. The Department of Health has mandated a review. There's also an internal Department of Defense so whatever course is directed which will not be fuel right will then drive what closure will look like. If it becomes, let's just say an alternate energy facility compared to a museum or just completely shut down it will then define differences in what closure means, if that makes sense.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I know it's an ongoing discussion and it's later on, but I think just recognizing that our technical definitions and I think you've stressed that there's defueling but it doesn't remove all the fuel and that closure is a different phase that still involves fuel.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Yes, ma'am. If I could just highlight, the Joint Task Forces in our military are established for expeditionary means for hard complex problems that require cross-functional teams. The Secretary of Defense and AWMAC felt that a Joint Task Force was the right approach to remove the preponderance of fuel because that was the biggest threat for the community as I said for today, the future generations. But this notion that we’ll get every drop out within the next 60 days after gravity defueling is done, it's just not possible. It's a physics problem, but what the Department of Defense is absolutely committed to do is to continue to do so as expeditiously or safely as possible and to ensure that the controls are in place to ensure that we don't have another mishap. That's why this transition, the turnover, and every control measure to ensure a deliberate and methodical approach is being taken.",0,C1,11/21/2023

"Sledge, that sort of thing. Anyway, congratulations that's great. Last year seems to have been a different tone and a different methodology involved and that's just great. I have a question really relating to the removal of the pipelines, the removal of the residual fuel and the sludge. How does that happen? Mechanically, I envisage sort of pipes being cleansed with a pig and forcing the material out the end and then perhaps a solvent or some sort of other material being used, all of which is carefully disposed of and through a same solid tight pipeline process. How is that going to go because that sounds a little stickier than...",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Again, it goes to the complexity that I highlighted, but I'm going to defer that question to Admiral Barnett when he gets to his, he's going to talk to that because well it's important. If you go back to slide 2 and you see the integrated master schedule and I appreciate the feedback, sir that you highlighted that there's been a methodical and deliberate approach. It's been a systems engineering approach to be honest with you and the Navy Closure Task Force is working an integrated master plan, an integrated master schedule that again will sequence all these activities, the preparations for and the actual execution. I referred to what we did to get to where we are and what we're doing right now with a symphony. It's going to be the same thing and it's different instruments at different tempos at different crescendos and volumes. That’s what's really going to have to happen and it's got to be planned, it's got to be methodical because this is a no fail mission and so Admiral Barnett will talk to that during his slides.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"There are two areas that are perhaps longer term, maybe a little stickier perhaps. One is of course the remediation of the aquifer through skimming or treatment or whatever. What are your plans in that respect? Secondly what sort of programs are you putting in place for outreach to the people that have been exposed through drinking water systems and otherwise to these petrochemical issues?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I'll let Admiral Killian talk a little bit about the remediation process. I think there’s a slide...he can explain that. As far as the medical side we're working with our partners DHA on those folks that have been exposed. I know they're at our meetings and they're working that process. I can get you more information on exposure. I know they're working with Department of Health also. They’re tracking them. I think they're doing a, it's not a survey, it's called a registry. I know that's in process, too so I can get you more information on that.",0,C1,11/21/2023

I don't need to know that. I'm just curious. It's a large number.,0,C1,11/21/2023
"Thank you for your report. The public outreach seems a simple phrase but it's a really difficult challenge. Have you identified clear stakeholder groups or constituencies that you're trying to impact and have clear goals for each of those system users? Certainly some stakeholders like us or the Board of Water Supply and so forth, the Department of Health would be another layer, the environmental community, the community leadership of political business and grassroots cultural stakeholders. “Ola i ka wai,” that’s our motto for this Commission so, it's kind of a sacred resource. Each of those has a constituency, to just blast things out to the general public one way is... One way to approach that if you segmented those and really have clear outcome targets of what you'd like to achieve with each of those. It'd be good to see those, to see how systematically you are with each of these major important constituencies you're trying to rebuild trust. I know it kind of starts with you, it's going to finish with the remediation team because you've got community outreach on both sides. You'll go so far to closure then they've got to pick it up in terms of the longer-term remediation.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"That's a great question and it's funny that you mention that because I've talked to Admiral Wade about that. He's going to give me his rolodex. [inaudible] I'm going to have the same strategic outreach coordinator, not a military person but who's going to be plugged into that. What I've done in my other regions which I think is going to work well here is I developed the bullseye and it was a bullseye type of chart. We can sit down and figure that. You’re spot on, sir and that's key to it. The intent is to get to those individuals, those nodes where I can make sure the information is getting out. We are working a play and believe it or not that's one of the bigger areas that we're sourcing up right now is our strategic engagement team. That's one of the first ones, that and the knowledge management. Obviously we got engineering here too, but those are the folks that I need to get in front of me but, I showed them a bullseye and I said, hey, this is what I used in other places, how do we count it?”",0,C1,11/21/2023
"If I may, my mission from the Secretary of Defense through Admiral Aquino has been the defueling of the technical, the engineering but also the communication piece with the community and multiple stakeholders. Not only those that may be very supportive but even critics. It's equally important and respect their positions. You have to look at this holistically. With this new supplement the Secretary of Defense has added a new mission to me and that mission is to ensure a deliberate turnover, so again the processes, the procedure. I have a team that's dedicated to this engagement because it's so critically important to inform what we're doing and why but then also to compassionately listen to and have a better understanding the concerns of the community and our military families. Admiral Barnett like he highlighted, they’re going to take that playbook and then build on it because it's going to be for the long term, as you noted, and has a little bit more dimensions. I'm defueling, but he's going to have the closure but the environmental remediation. What closure means to one person may be different to another as you highlighted, ma’am. It's going to be equally important. That's the art, the science and then the art of the mission.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I just want to express appreciation for your acknowledgement that what you hear is as important as what you say. That you want to send a signal that builds confidence. Let people know that you're listening to them and record those thoughts and address those as best you can, in our experience.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"You said your team will be 200 individuals so basically maybe 10% of the staff will be from JTF. What positions, what responsibilities are those staff? Are they engineers or are they also the community face?",0,C1,11/21/2023
It's going to be both.,0,C1,11/21/2023
"That 10% will have perhaps some heavy responsibility to sort of transmitting that information. The other question I have is you say, “we will be here for the long term,” but in Hawaiʻi that perhaps given the Navy's structure and the tours of duty, what does that mean when you say that?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"My task force is going to be primarily, I think of the 200 or so folks, the majority will be staying, that's the continuity. It'll be about 32 individuals that will be working here. There is continuity in the forces that are there. Obviously I'll be here as long as I'm ordered here and I will tell you I'm probably going to be here longer than any other place I've been, so that’s good.",0,C1,11/21/2023
Longer than 10 months.,0,C1,11/21/2023
He's been here longer than 10 months.,0,C1,11/21/2023
"I’ve been here longer than 10 months. That's the continuity there and that's one thing that I want to stress to the community is that I like to think I'm important, but what’s more important are the folks that are here or the teammates that are behind. I'm just here to help move barriers. That's the key for that and additionally, my strategic engagement person will be reaching out to each of you individually to discuss the case with you. We have to make sure we take all the information in, the good ideas so we make sure we’re on track.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Just to confirm, the team that will transfer over is engineering and community engagement but, I think an important concern that I can hear is that are the monitoring staff or people who are knowledgeable about safety and monitoring, is that a significant part? Especially because of the connection with DOH.",0,C1,11/21/2023
Will you mention that?,0,C1,11/21/2023
When it comes to my turn.,0,C1,11/21/2023
I'm just getting ahead of schedule. One more and maybe it's been said elsewhere but can you speak a little bit to your experience closing other facilities because this is a different beast.,0,C1,11/21/2023
This is a different beast. I know the Navy at large has experience with this. I haven't had any personal experience with it. I think what I bring to the table is the eye to be able to look at the experience just because I've been in regions for so long but also able to reach back to DC to talk to my friends. I don't have any personal experience but the Navy has closed a couple of facilities. I think one was in Point Loma and the other was in [inaudible]. Once again back to a region I’m familiar with if I can bring back lessons learned.,0,C1,11/21/2023
Perhaps build some knowledge transfer from those and I think showing the public.,0,C1,11/21/2023
And the public engagement space.,0,C1,11/21/2023
"I just wanted to make a statement. I have always been somewhat of a critic only because Admiral Wade was singularly focused on defueling, Admiral Barnett has not only closure and remediation but he also has his other duties in region. I was concerned about that and I've had discussions with Admiral Barnett about that and he has assured me that if I have any issues and I've told him that I would be critical of that and that I really need him to be as focused and his team to be as focused as the defueling team was. Also recognizing that it should be of the same high priority that defueling had and we want it to be done in as expeditiously a fashion as we can, recognizing that we have the safety of the aquifer that needs to be taken into consideration. He has assured me that he will have that same focus and we will hold him to it.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Please do. I'll tell you that I have a strong staff on the Navy of the Hawaiʻi side and they understand that. I have two chiefs of staff, got one admiral, but you will have my commitment. Yes, there are a lot of things but I've got teammates that work for me whether you’re talking wastewater treatment facilities, talking other things. There's a lot of things that I can kind of look over and give guidance on but I know how important this is.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I appreciate that. I just want to follow up. I had an opportunity to meet with you. Kathy Ho and I remember the days of Kahoʻolawe. This is a very different Navy than then but it's everything. The walk is in the talk, so greatly appreciate the candor, the recognition, lessons learned and I'm hearing a lot of really good things, but I recognize as I transition from one administration to the next, there needs to be a seamless transition. As Admiral Wade transfers over to Admiral Barnett a lot of the questions I'm hearing from Aurora and others about community outreach. We wanted to try to provide a platform here so communities can get updated, but I just want to confirm that there is a seamless transition between personnel and messaging that goes from Joint Task Force, the defueling over to the closure and remediation, that that messaging continues on as well as the continuity of this because in Hawaii everything's about relationships. You develop a relationship and the challenge has been a lot of times with the Navy every two years that changes. I appreciate the fact that you have the institutional knowledge and commitment from your civilian staff who will continue on that but again the faces who interact with the community, are those also being transitioned from Admiral Wade to Admiral Barnett, that team of community engagement people? Because the last thing the community needs is community fatigue and there's just another person that I'm going to meet. Is there continuity with the community faces of the Navy who engages on behalf of the Navy with the with the rest of the community?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I can jump in real quick. To be clear, I say this humbly but I have become the face of defueling. Admiral Barnett will become the face of closure. It's just because he's going to be out there like I was and just knowing him and we're neighbors and we've known each other for years that's his personality. That's for full transparency. General Okamura who is my director of strategic engagement, he must return to the Army, but he will turn over with a counterpart who will be responsible for the engagement for the community working under Admiral Barnett. There will be a transition of people but the mission will still be the same. The process will be the same and then if I can now turn over to you (General Hashimoto) because you have the umbrella of working in PACOM. If you can then highlight your...",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I think what you'll find and not to get too far ahead of who the new General Okamoto is, you already know her. She's a longtime resident, local girl. She used to be part of the Marine Corps family, she now works for the Navy. I have full confidence in her and a multi-generational resident of Hawaiʻi and has the right touch. I think you’ll be very, very pleased with her efforts.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Community members want to be candid and they probably aren't going to approach Admiral Barnett, but the people who are actually on the ground doing the outreach. Is there continuity with that group of people from one mission to the next?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"What I'll tell you is that for instance on my Navy region Hawaiʻi side we have individuals, community plans and liaisons officers, we call them civil officers. These are the folks that they're at the community meetings, they're out at the neighborhood boards and we're at these boards and Admiral Wade would send his team over. They would be at the board together, so there will be some continuity at the grassroots level. To a certain extent where, hey this is the same person that was there doing defueling, would be that continuity in there. Then we're doing something called a left seat, right seat turnover which is where his folks are in one seat, my new folks are sitting next to him and they're out there doing introductions seeing each other. Those new faces then, because as we know in any organization whether I can think of operational side whether it’s flying or surface warfare actions or things, it's the transitions that you have to watch out for. It's the transitions going from one phase to another. That's where you on a scale of 1 to 10, you probably got to be 11 or 12 during the transitions because that's where things fall into cracks. My team is aware of that, but I think the left seat, right seat sitting next to their counterpart, meeting, talking story, getting those relationships so then say, okay get out of here, we got it.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I think the assistance of a playbook also helps with the transition. You got the best playbook we've seen so far and when somebody comes in, they're not freelancing. We're going back to the script.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I was just wondering is somebody going to address the long-term, the organization that will be in there for the long term to monitor the health of the aquifer? And what resources would they have available to them for that?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Yes, sir. Admiral Killian will address that with you and I'll make sure he does.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"The new Red Hill plant that's being designed, what would the design capacity be there?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"We would look to meet 10 to 12 million gallons per day. Historically coming out of Red Hill, we've pulled 5 to 6 million gallons. We can go back in our records and look where we pulled more but essentially it’ll be a 10 to 12 million gallon pull.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"What I'm hearing and not quite seeing but I'm hearing, that you have an implicit goal of making sure that this system is safe and that it meets a certain quality. The more you make that explicit the better and to do that, number one, you gather data. That's the purpose of the sampling, it's not just the number of samples that you do but it's the knowledge that you have about the safety and the purity of the source. You do the sampling for a reason and you can share that. Secondly, you have a response plan. It'd be good to see what your response plan is, that samples are going to come in from here to there and when they reach certain thresholds it triggers an action plan, I assume on your part. It'd be good to see that. You told us how many with the number of samples. What did the samples tell us? If we laid that data out it would give confidence that a lot of stuff is okay within the safety area and when it's not, here's our response plan to that. Third you have a commitment to transparency through all these community outreach things to tell people what you're doing, but I think you had that goal framework of the overall goal of having a safe resource and you handle that by gathering data by responding in cases of need and being transparent about it. I think a framework like that would help the public understand.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I appreciate that great input. When we come back next meeting I'll bring a framework with me but I'll speak to it right now. Of the samples that we've taken, we've had initial tests, 21 exceedances. 20 of the 21 have been clear, we have one that's pending clearance right now. Just to give you an example of the 20, I think 18 are lead and copper. We find this is not uncommon, unfortunately this is true throughout all infrastructure, but I certainly will take that.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"That response is just spot on. That's exactly what people need to hear, not just that you did 100 samples but only 21 of them bad and 20 of them clear and here's what it was.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"That's all embedded within the long-term monitoring plan. We have notification requirements to DOH and EPA. Those trigger once we hit EALs. If we hit an EAL then we make those notifications, but that's a point well taken and I need to do a better job outlining.",0,C1,11/21/2023
The priority is safe drinking water. Another hat that we have here at DLNR is ecosystem. Are you doing any monitoring for ecosystem?,0,C1,11/21/2023
"The second piece of it is groundwater. I'll put that in the category of ecosystem. We are currently sampling at 35 wells two years ago. I know this is a two- year anniversary. 22 new wells were proposed and approved. Of the 22, 16 are complete, 3 are in progress now, and 3 more to follow both on and off Navy property. Furthermore, I have requested from BWS for them to provide consultation to us on locations that they think are best fit. We'll continue to have that dialogue. This is one thing I want to make sure you folks understand. I mentioned I'm not time constrained and I'm not money constrained, so if we need to do additional five wells or whatever the case may be then we'll do that. We will go where our data takes us and so I want to make sure that I communicate that to the community. I do have one thing I will ask the Commission, but I'll wait till I get to the end.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Besides just the monitoring, I'm interested in are you monitoring water quality in Pearl Harbor, in our streams, in nearshore waters? So that we've got some baseline data to make informed decision-making, we don't know what impact the leak has had on our aquifer as well as waters that may have gone out to Pearl Harbor or in our stream. Are you doing any monitoring in our streams or our ocean waters?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"We are not monitoring the water quality conditions in Pearl Harbor. As we execute construction in and around the waterfront we're required to go through NEPA and that's a planning process that requires a variety of tasks, but that's not tied to this effort here. We're primarily focused on the Red Hill property and those that are adjacent to the property and then of course we test the water that comes out of the gaps because of the Hālawa Stream. That's the extent of it. Let me add one additional point. We just talked about water. Once our site assessment is complete, we use the word holistic a lot, I apologize but it will be a comprehensive holistic look including soil. There are areas we where we're most likely going to have to clean it up. Most likely we know we're going to have to clean it up and as I mentioned before we'll go where we find it.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I'm going to hold you to that because I'm also looking at impacts to marine resources. We have no idea. I'm looking at least trying to get baseline data, at least knowing what the conditions are today. What's the water quality? Has it changed over time? Is the impact of the fuel in our aquifer in some way leaking out to our nearshore waters, our streams? But without those monitoring devices in place, it's hard for me to tell.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I know that when this, maybe a year and a half ago or maybe even two years ago, when they were putting the water down the stream, Hālawa Stream, there were monitors out there and I don't know if it's continued.",0,C1,11/21/2023
Maybe you can talk about that. Is that what you're getting at?,0,C1,11/21/2023
"But when you said, for me money is not an issue, oh I just jumped on that one.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I've been given specific, direct orders that we need to execute what I'm briefing you on and so I don't start with how much does it cost, I start with how can we make it happen? And what type of contract do I write and what is the engineering approach to it?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Okay, well I want you to put that into your equations during your site assessment also looking at ecosystems, marine ecosystems, fish, impacts to limu. I just need to ensure that I've got baseline data now so our staff can make informed decisions, our Division of Aquatic Resources, our Forestry Management because we don't have the resources to put monitoring devices into the ocean or the streams. I guess that would be helpful.",0,C1,11/21/2023

"This is great because I think a lot of the questions that we get on the Commission really relate to what is in your purview. You also mentioned there is an upcoming meeting and is that an open, you were talking about BREC closure, cleanup and then something coming in the next...",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I want to be careful because I use the word BREC, this is not a BREC action.",0,C1,11/21/2023
Sorry what does BREC stand for?,0,C1,11/21/2023
"Base realignment enclosure. That's not what this is. What I'm sharing with you is that we have professionals that work in that program that understand complex environmental remediation cleanup activities. I'm bringing those experts here. It's an internal meeting essentially to brainstorm an approach to this facility given that it is not a closure activity with respect to the law, but it's how are we going to approach this. We need those types of people to advise us.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"That's great. That helps give me some confidence that the Navy has the capacity to address what we're being asked a lot. I would just ask as that those plans develop if that can be communicated and there be some way to have some dialogue on like, hey does this work for the things you are concerned about with the Commission, with DOH? Because we're interested in the aquifer. I do have a question. You mentioned that the Navy is working on four items and you spoke mostly about the last three. Item one, remove for immediate contamination. That is what's on the agenda in the coming weeks, is that correct or is there something you can tell us now about it?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"There are two parts of that so the next slide I'm going to walk through all the activities that we have in progress and that gets to the question that I think was asked earlier about the skimmers and then I'll come back to the discussion. Think of it really as near term, in progress right now, and then the future and the future meaning what does environmental remediation at Red Hill look like as we work through the closure process. What I mentioned just a few minutes ago was me pulling professionals here to Hawaiʻi to talk about once we get our site assessment, what's the next step? Everything that I'm describing there's a key few, I'm going to digress for a second. There's a couple things that Admiral Wade didn't talk about this but I will. As we look at JTF sunsetting and Navy Closure Task Force coming on board, I will tell you there are two things from an engineering perspective that have been outstanding. One is the establishment of the engineering controls during work that's going to continue. That will not change and that will fall under Admiral Barnett's purview but as the engineer in the background supporting them, we are going to ensure that that happens. The other thing probably most importantly is the integrated master schedule we call the playbook. That is an important piece but it's not possible right now for us to have a 100% playbook developed because we don't know what we don't know yet. This will be a living document that we will build as we go and then it'll be available for public consumption and at future meetings like this, so we'll continue to do that.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Question on the site assessment, my understanding is that the University of Hawaiʻi and USGS have been working on another study that was related to the geology of the region and are these done in parallel or are they working together?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I think you read my mind. Let's talk about that so that's groundwater modeling. There are two groundwater modeling efforts in progress today, there's one that was actually initiated before the Red Hill release in November of 2021. That's being accomplished by a company called AE Comp. They provided what they call the best available model in June of 2023. I directed them to because I said I'm tired of talking about it, I want your best model available but send it back to Department of Health and EPA and get their feedback which we've received. That model is not approved. They've done a lot of work, there's a lot of science behind it. They are on schedule to provide us for resubmission the next best available model next summer. That's one effort. The second one that I think you're referencing ma'am is from University of Hawaii, is a completely separate effort. It's independent, I have no control over it. This is an Office of Naval Research funded, it's a grant to the University of Hawaii that includes an engineering services contract. They're completely independent from the Navy and they're working the modeling effort. I can't speak to all the details right now, but I can commit in the future to talk to the specifics about both of those models and outline the hydrogeology and geophysics and all that behind it. But the purpose of that and coming back to Chair Chang, to your question about Pearl Harbor is better understanding the flow of the groundwater underneath the Red Hill complex. It is complicated, it's heterogeneous information. We all know living on islands, we live on volcanic rock, it's not heterogeneous. What does that mean to the person who's not technical? It means there could be multiple pathways for anything to flow anywhere, groundwater, whatever the case may be. Those two studies will better inform cleanup efforts. I asked for an update on their schedule, I think we're probably going to be a year and a half to two years out before we get those studies back. I think that's okay because it helps us better understand, make informed decisions regarding cleanup actions and get after these things in the best way possible. I only talked about long term so let me come back to short term.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Thinking about the treatment at Red Hill Shaft and trying to reduce the volume of water being pumped, it seems like it would be useful to use the groundwater monitoring data that has been collected at regular intervals to understand the nature of whether that is working. Have you done that analysis?",0,C1,11/21/2023
We sample the groundwater wells and our data we collect it to help us better characterize it. If we see any type migration then that's a trigger. It requires regulatory agency notification but the groundwater wells are part of that overall system of systems if you will.,0,C1,11/21/2023
"I know that the data is being collected, but will we get a chance to kind of see it or have you done an analysis and interpretation of it maybe with DOH to understand the effectiveness of that capture zone? I guess I've heard criticism because of the nature of the Maui style shaft that actually doesn't create a very strong gradient. Is the data we're collecting going to be sufficient to allow for that determination to be made and is that with the Department?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I can address this one, ma'am. The subject matter experts that are working for both the Navy, the Department of Health, the EPA, CWRM has folks that are involved, the USGS. Our subject matter experts have got together many times on this topic and we have pulled together all the analytics of what we believe is happening. We've had those discussions, we had submitted it to the DOH and the EPA. There is still a little bit of a disagreement at the SME level and on the 15th of November, Dr. Ho and the DOH responded back with a letter that really is a path forward for how we can still resume or still proceed with a reduced flow at the completion of defueling as we continue to get our SMEs together to really come to an agreement. So, yes there are reports that we've submitted. They've been reviewed, there have been many, many meetings on this to try to work through those differences of opinions as the models continue to develop that will continue to inform it. Every day every piece of new information we get gets brought to that SME level, but where we sit right now today is on the 15th of November we do appreciate the letter that we just got from DOH that lays out a path that allows...we have to respond with the additional sampling that would be required as we move towards that reduced pumping.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Aurora, what we didn't want to do is to reduce the flow while there was defueling in the event there was something. We kept it at that rate and then we are moving forward, after defueling we're going to be able to see whether we can reduce it.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"That helps to understand the logic. A simpler question, is there still fuel coming into the shaft?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Right now, skimming operations are running 24/7. We have a skimmer that is there as we're pulling, so we're to the point where we are getting less than a teaspoon a month that is coming, very small amounts as opposed to two years ago when it was several hundred gallons were abstracted by the divers and everybody that went. To answer your question yes, there still is small amounts that are coming in and that is proof as Admiral Killian talked about the capture zone, that any contamination that still may be coming is being pulled and collected by those skimmers on the surface of the water.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"It seems like at this point we're spending a lot of energy and resources and water. If we can catch it earlier on then that would be a more efficient strategy but you guys, I assume have thought through all of this. I just wanted to ask a question for the sake of public transparency.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I appreciate the complexity of the task as reflected in the schedule and I also appreciate whoever gave us an 11x17 version of it so I don't have to pinch and expand. There's a lot of detail here and what I've heard in your responses to questions and the narrative you've offered are some really important points that don't jump out when you look at the schedule. I would encourage if not on this page which is pretty busy, another page says what does all this mean. What are the highlights of this and you've done that on the bottom of some of your prior slides because this is the punch line, this is what you take away from this. Give us the good news, give us the bad news as well. But tell us what's important in what's going on here. It'll just help.",0,C1,11/21/2023

"Public accountability, I’m sure we’ll be responding.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"We went through the website pretty quickly, but it looked really good from my standpoint. I wonder if you've had focus groups with key constituents to see if they're liking it, if it's impacting them the way you want it to?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"It has and we continue to receive feedback and take that feedback to update it. We have very separate websites. We want to make sure the drinking water and the groundwater are separate because it's different standards, but each of the different outreach booths will walk through with people that are concerned, concerned citizens or just general public that have questions and we'll walk them through the website and take their feedback for how we can continue to improve it as it goes on. Still have some work to do but we're open to any additional suggestions.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Recently, there were 12 families that had indicated that there was some issue with their water. I think you guys went out to six of them, took samples. Are they reflected in your website?",0,C1,11/21/2023
"The long-term monitoring, when we get those validated samples back yes, they would be included within this data, but we do reach directly back out to any concerned resident. We will give them a result, we will talk through the results with them, and walk them through any concerns. Once that data is validated and the LTM sample is completed, it would be added to this website along with everything. It's not going to call them out separately, it would be included in the LTM sampling that we receive.",0,C1,11/21/2023
I'm not sure if it's a NAVFAC question or where in the Navy it resides but at least wearing my UH hat I've heard concerns over water sort of on the back end of the water heaters. Whose responsibility are the heaters and trying to make the connection between the calls coming in and where we test? There's this sort of netherworld of the heater.,0,C1,11/21/2023
"The water heaters, that has been a point of discussion over the last several weeks and we've been working very closely with the EPA and the DOH. We realize that we've tested the house, we know it is not fuel related, there are no other contaminations that we've identified through all of the normal testing. We’ve been working with the DOH and the EPA on how do we test the water heaters? How do we look at all of the rest of the system? For some of the residents that have shown that concern recently, in fact today right now I think it is still going on we have a couple of those houses where we're doing several things. We're flushing it out, we're checking the temperatures of the water heater, looking for any biological type growth, we're inspecting all of the fixtures throughout the entire house, we are draining and taking samples from the water heater. We immediately took a water heater sample and did the rapid test which it doesn't follow the Offland. It's not an EPA approved process, but we conducted the rapid test and we are taking samples of those water heaters. That actually has started today going to several of those concerned residents to do further, we refer to it as premise plumbing, but really to try to identify. We know what it's not, but after identifying what could be the issue that is causing concern. That's in progress.",0,C1,11/21/2023

There was a comment on your working relationship with the Board of Water Supply. Could you expand that a bit? He said you have a technical relationship that's getting better or did I misunderstand that?,0,C1,11/21/2023
"I characterize our relationship with Board of Water Supply as positive. We meet quarterly with the staff over there. We have primarily technical discussions as both of us are purveyors of water. I think that's an accurate characterization. We discuss things such as potential placement of monitoring wells, what do they think. We certainly want to draw on their expertise as experts on water here in Oʻahu. It would be silly for us not to recognize that, so we correspond with them and meet with them in person.",0,C1,11/21/2023

"This is a question that’s been weighing on me for a long time. It's hypothetical and you needn’t answer if it's inappropriate. It’s always seemed to me that to ship samples with all the protections and everything else off to the mainland, wait two weeks for results was a long way around. At the Department of Water Supply on Maui we had a CLIA certified lab suitable only for the samples generated by the department on Maui with respect to its drinking water wells and sources and treatment plants and that sort of thing. It's only sized for that capacity but it's CLIA certified. It's got the mass spectrometers and the technicians and all that sort of thing. If a lab existed in Hawaii suitable for conducting all the sampling of your programs, would that make sense from your perspective?",0,C1,11/21/2023
We’d use them in heartbeat. I prefer not to have to ship them.,0,C1,11/21/2023
Why do you think it hasn't been done already?,0,C1,11/21/2023
"I can't, I have no aversion if there...",0,C1,11/21/2023
"Can I answer something on that because on the UH end, that's been a discussion over and over again because UH was like why don't we have it at UH? But part of it is the level of QAQC that's required and the personnel needed and economy of scale.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"The Department of Health was given some money by the legislature to stand up a drinking water lab so we bought the equipment and now we have the proper CLIA certifications, EPA certifications. We're getting staffed up and are learning how to use the equipment.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"If I can just add in, the role of UH was determined to assist in a non-regulatory fashion but leave the high-level meeting compliance matters to the much more resourced Department of Health.",0,C1,11/21/2023
"I want to express my appreciation for the representation that we have here. The leadership being shown, we didn't always have representatives who had authority over the matters being discussed or the information that was pertinent to the discussion or were very responsive. It feels like we now do. That's a huge step forward in looking at the clarity of your mission to defuel, to close, and remediate. That mission aligns with our interest of protecting the public trust resource and it aligns with what we've heard from the public in testimony. It's not just words, you have a plan and I get it it's a living plan. Some things that you think are going to work out aren't and so we'll track it and we'll monitor the effectiveness of the plan you set forth. You’ve resourced that appropriately both in terms of human talent and in terms of monetary talent and if that's an issue, there should be discussion of it and you're executing. I like the schedules and I love that. A little bit more focus on variance reporting in terms of here's where we plan plus or minus, let's see the deltas and let's reforecast or adjust our track so we can be accountable to our duties as well as to the public.

"we are the largest cooperator of the USGS hydrological data collection network, but we're not the only funder. A lot of our stations are cost-shared with other entities. Outside of the USGS, I know of a few, the University of Hawai‘i or federal organizations that measure flow or maintain any monitoring sites. There is the Department of Health when they do some of their field work, they also measure flow at the location, but in many circumstances, the county just pays for the USGS to maintain a station or monitor for particular measurements, that sort of thing. There are a few non-profits that make flow measurements but I'm not aware of where they store that data.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"Chair, we do come every August to renew and get approval from the commission to renew that cooperative agreement.

does DOT do any kind of monitoring?,0,C1,05/16/2023
"they cost share. Most of their funding goes to crest-stage gauges. So, across the state, they fund hundreds of crest-stage gauges and where there's synergy with water commission’s efforts or USGS’s needs, we cost share stations; like in Waikapū, we added a natural flow USGS station to the cooperative agreement in the last couple of years. And it's being cost-shared with the Department of Transportation. So, they fund the peak flow estimates which involve a lot of modeling, a lot of work to measure stream channel contours, and that sort of thing. In order to expand the network with our limited funds we look for opportunities to cost share where possible.",0,C1,05/16/2023

are you suggesting that staff support the Department of Health with the collection of samples for analysis of water quality? Is that what you're suggesting?,0,C1,05/16/2023
well can they help you provide money? I mean they must be spending money on doing that.,0,C1,05/16/2023

"well, I mean the question will come up. If you look at sustainability long term is that a quantity and quality issue? And if we're going to start using surface water for potable needs, when do we start understanding what’s contributing to the quality of that water? At the end of your presentation, what is a balance that you need in terms of gauging stations or measurement capacity to get to a point where we understand where we can strike a balance in providing you know sustainable water sources for all the needs?",0,C1,05/16/2023
"so, the commission supported the USGS study, looking at our Water Resource monitoring needs and there was a publication two years ago; now it's three years ago on where we need groundwater monitoring, where do we need streamflow monitoring, where do we need rainfall monitoring, and especially going into this period of climate uncertainty. We know where we need to monitor, we just don't have the funding to do it.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"well, is there sort of a dream sheet where you kind of pencil out the funding requirements given the pressure or the interest in climate change?",0,C1,05/16/2023
"definitely, and I presented that to the commission either last year or the year before that; given the constraints of USGS’s, ability to add stream gauges for example we could probably realistically add three to five USGS gauging stations each year to the cooperative agreement for the next 10 years. And then we would be at a much better place monitoring surface water resources across the state. And that's not to take anything away from what we do as staff. We would continue but we're at capacity. I'm hoping that we get to hire more staff in the near term, and I believe we do have funding to do that, but we are staff time and budget limited.",0,C1,05/16/2023

So, I think the goal of this Administration will work to kind of tighten up that relationship; understand that data sharing more clearly, and then how we can work better together across agencies on water quality and quantity.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"quick question, so I was just thinking about the workload and what you guys are crucial for; all of it. But what can you potentially outsource- if have you thought about that- because your skills are valuable as a hydrologist. Are there other activities that could potentially be outsourced?",0,C1,05/16/2023
more money to hire USGS.,0,C1,05/16/2023
"and the data processing; some of it’s automated but it still requires a real human so, is there something that takes most of your time? Just curious.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"yeah QAQC. In terms of the amount of time that I'm not in the field. Obviously going in the field is a whole day. So usually, we're on the 5:45 or 6:15 a.m. flight and then we're back at seven or eight o'clock at night. And that’s a standard field day. We had a team yesterday go to Kaua‘i and they were on the 5:50 a.m. flight and back home at 8:00 p.m. flight landing at 8:40 p.m.. Then you have all the data that was gathered, you have to process that data, and so for every day I'm in the field, there's at least one day that you need to be in the office. I'm not available to do anything else during that period and it's not just me, it's a collective effort and we have a really solid team.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"I will highlight that that is why when we have him available, he's pushing to be fully present in this conversation for the review of the data and proposed management recommendations. It’s one thing to collect the data, but then how is that data used for management recommendations is another part. Ayron is and his team is good at what they do. But it's shifting into item C2; so, we wanted to make sure we updated this body again and the public about what it takes to get the data. It does take time, money, and resources to do that.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"when we have lawsuits, do we make that part of mitigation a requirement that they have to pay for monitoring and staff to monitor?",0,C1,05/16/2023
"I mean this is an AG question potentially. But what we've been trying to do where somebody's diverting water we've made sure that they're one reporting their diverted amount of water that they're using. They either have to comply and meet the reporting requirements or we just recommend if you partner with us and USGS pays for the gages then it's an install; that it's kind of an upfront cost. But in the long term, you get this data that ensures that you're in compliance with the IIFS. So, there has been more focused effort I would say in the past four or five years to push, to have this sharing, this partnership in a regulatory compliance kind of perspective. We all benefit from good data. So, there's been that shift to try to see where we can partner and it's not a hundred percent Water Commission funding for this resource. We try to get those private partners on board. I’ll touch on this a little bit in item C2 focusing on where we can leverage other federal funding and programs to support the data collection needs of our staff and agency.",0,C1,05/16/2023
when you get others collecting data is there a quality assurance issue?,0,C1,05/16/2023
"that is a big issue and one of the challenges on both sides. Whenever we've had enforcement actions brought before the commission, we try our best to use our data. We provide the opportunity for those bringing the complaint against to provide alternative data. Oftentimes they don't have that and so they've also seen the benefit of investing in their own data collection; to have an alternative to our data sets. We also like USGS, they collect data with no management recommendations, and we rely on them oftentimes for some of that core data in our management decisions and even enforcement compliance recommendations.",0,C1,05/16/2023
and maybe we can make this administratively or have to get legislation. We perhaps should be looking at passing on some of those costs through our permitting process. There’s a fee associated with the permits that goes into a fund to pay for data.,0,C1,05/16/2023
"so, that is coming forward in potentially our administrative rules and recommendations, which our regulatory fees that we authority to do, so that way portions of those fees like if you're benefiting from the use of diverting water, you're also contributing into cost sharing. Understanding what the low flow is and what it takes to monitor and engage so that's one way to kind of offset the stop cost potentially in the future.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"I also want to add that in a situation where there's a lawsuit or a settlement is achieved; say with Kamehameha schools in the Lalakea issue. It's a fixed amount and USGS gauges, while there is an upfront cost, there's also an operation and maintenance costs that we pay for every year. That's where we see the benefit of a particular gauge that was funded temporarily. It gets funded through a cooperative agreement with Kamehameha schools and then six years down the road the money dries up and then we don't have that data coming in. So, we add it to our cooperative agreement. I apologize for adding to the cost of our cooperative agreement, but I see the benefit of increased data collection, so we just keep adding stations.",0,C1,05/16/2023
Ayron and thank you for your work you and your crew are really at the heart of our ability to make quality decisions on the part of the commission.,0,C1,05/16/2023
they are wonderful. We appreciate them every day.,0,C1,05/16/2023
"yeah, Ayron how do you cooperate with DAR and DOFAW and the Water Commission, three separate agencies that really have differing responsibilities and managing streams, especially on state-owned land. Is that just kind of informal cooperation or do you have something written that kind of spells that up?",0,C1,05/16/2023
We appreciate the help we receive from the DOFAW base yards.,0,C1,05/16/2023
"They have assisted us on numerous occasions, whether it’s getting unstuck in the mud, delivering items, or signing off on deliveries. They have also been helpful in storing equipment for us. We cooperate with them on DLNR issues involving water, especially when jurisdictions overlap. DAR has a smaller footprint and focuses primarily on marine ecosystems. While they have jurisdiction over freshwater biota, their capacity for work is limited. Pooling our resources with DAR has been instrumental, particularly in conducting biota surveys. During the pandemic, DAR staff couldn’t travel, so our commission staff’s approval to assist with biota surveys on Maui was beneficial. Thorough habitat analysis and biota surveys require four or five staff, while DAR had only two available on the island. CWRM coordinating and providing access to locations has been helpful, especially on Maui.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"yeah, and I'm not surprised I mean DOFAW has a good history. And one other quick question. Do you prioritize dissemination and acquisition of data on state-owned streams, manage streams, or privately owned? Is there any sort of significance?",0,C1,05/16/2023
we don't prioritize anything. Anywhere we have data need we try and figure out a way to collect the data. With the constraints that we have; a budget that is limiting.,0,C1,05/16/2023
"I think you folks have prioritized IIFSs and the balancing of in-stream and off-stream needs based on a lot of those streams that were heavily diverted historically. We've prioritized those streams that have this tension or the need for balance of off-stream and in-stream. And there are other streams that are purely not being diverted. So, I think a lot of the focus is where there are in-stream and off-stream needs that need to be balanced. That's where the commission spent the majority of its time since 2012 when you guys started really ramping up IIFSs. So, I think we're almost there and there are a couple more areas that we're going to focus and shift to; Southeast Kaua‘i is one of them. But other than that, a lot of those historic plantation systems had diverted a lot of water out of watershed. Ayron and his team have really kind of just re-established more of a balanced approach to protect streams where they need in-stream values to be protected as well as balancing off stream needs in that process. So, there are some prioritizations in that context.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"one more quick comment. Chair, I know as DLNR Chair you have many priorities everyone needs more resources, but investing in Ayron and his team right now is probably one of the best investments you could make at this time.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"I appreciate that, Mike. I'm trying to figure out how I can save them time by having staff on the other Island. How can we empower DOFAW to be multitasked? I am really trying to break down silos within DLNR so that there's better cooperation where we can cross over. A lot of this is being done informally, but I think we have a really good opportunity this legislative session is going to provide us with a lot more needed tool. I've personally really appreciated Ayron's presentation. I knew how valuable they were, I didn't know how invaluable they really are to this department and the commission's ability to make informed decisions. We could not operate without them.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"yeah, just a quick one Ayron. I noticed you flashed up and said the data was available.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"we have an online data portal, it’s cwrm.aquaticinformatics.net. It is publicly available, it doesn't require login. The caveat is that there are some quirks to it that we haven't quite ironed out, including not all the stations that are real-time are reporting in real-time.",0,C1,05/16/2023
"like the batteries are at out, the tTelemetry is out. It's just because USGS has their data, and they have their disclaimers. Even if just a link were available, I could see it being very valuable for the public.",0,C1,05/16/2023
So I'll go to Molokai - so this is the Kamoku intake station. Some of these statistics aren't really valid because we haven't been there in three months so it's like you have to take it with a grain of salt a little bit.,0,C1,05/16/2023
"Ayron, with those communities that you've been helping to support collect data or Department of Ag or other agencies, they access this now currently for data, so we do more direct data sharing versus larger public dissemination. Because we can control the messaging and the limits of that data sharing, it is something that again hopefully with more staff, we will be able to get up to a point where it can be made available to the larger public in real-time.",0,C1,05/16/2023
are we doing data collection for climate change?,0,C1,05/16/2023
"we've prioritized maintaining USGS gauging stations with really long records, particularly in locations with climate change impacts. This allows us to better understand changes in rainfall patterns, including increased or decreased rainfall, more intense storm events but fewer of them, and extended drought periods. Whether it's more rainfall, less rainfall, or more intense storm events, but fewer of them more drought periods. By preserving a continuous record, we can analyze trends over time. In the past few years, we have successfully re-established three or four USGS stations with discontinued long-term records from the 50s, 60s, or 70s. so that we can do a deep dive into what is happening now relative to what happened 100 years ago.",0,C1,05/16/2023

"well in addition, one of our focuses last month, we had PDKE come and present, but we also work very closely with Water Resource Research Center and really building up the Mesonet program, which is the establishment of these climate stations that'll collect a myriad of different data sets that will help to hopefully inform some climate predictions. I don't want to jump into the technicalities of it but that's how we've been really focusing our climate efforts is to support Dr. Giambelluca with the establishment once that's built out, we should have that's one of the focal points of the data collection.",0,C1,05/16/2023

"Ayron, I join the other Commissioners and thank you for your work and long been impressed by both the volume of it as well as the value of it. So, you've got four staff what would be optimal?",0,C1,05/16/2023
"obviously, if we were to maintain monitoring stations at the level which USGS maintains them; they assign about eight to ten stations per staff, so we have about 50 or 60 stations, just for data hydrological data collection. We would need five to six staff just for that, not including biota, not including what we need for meetings, or community engagement, just to maintain stations.",0,C1,05/16/2023

"so, let’s just say double what we have as a round number. So, is there any prospects for that possibility, Kaleo? Let me ask one last thing of Ayron. You've talked about the scope of the data, just highlight the substance. What's the most alarming thing you're finding? What's the most gratifying thing you're finding?",0,C1,05/16/2023
"On the stream flow side, we faced extreme drought conditions in East Maui during 2020, 2021, and 2022. In some streams like Ho‘olawa nui and ‘O‘opuola, the measured low flows were even lower than the entire period of record for the USGS gauges, which have been in place for 50 to 60 years. This is a concerning situation. Despite the challenges, we were able to rapidly quantify these low flow conditions under the current climate conditions. We conducted a three-year study in about 18 months with the help of conversations with the USGS. Turning to the biota side, we observed a lack of expected recruitment in streams like Waiāhole on Windward O‘ahu, despite significant flow restoration efforts. One contributing factor seems to be vegetation management issues in the estuary. Large sections of the stream are clogged with hau bush, similar to the situation in Kahana where overgrowth of invasive vegetation has impacted the stream channel and native species recruitment. It’s disheartening to note that at the 400-foot elevation, we didn’t find a single ‘alamo‘o or an nōpili in a stream that should ideally support their presence due to significant base flow restoration. It’s worth mentioning that the watershed where these issues arise is not directly managed by DOFAW. While they manage for myconia and other factors, the overall dominance of non- native invasive vegetation in the watershed plays a role in the challenges we observe. We are still in the process of quantifying the impact of this vegetation, and that’s why we are gathering data-to better understand its role. In a recent survey of a higher elevation reach in Waikāne, we were amazed to find four different native species, including naniha, nākea, and nōpili. Waikāne doesn’t face the same estuary clogging issues as Waiāhole, but it does have water quality challenges due to the presence of junk cars and cesspools in the watershed. Despite these factors, witnessing the presence of native species at a higher elevation than expected was enlightening.",0,C1,05/16/2023
thank you so much Ayron to you and your team. Mahalo for all of your good work.,0,C1,05/16/2023
I have to say thank you to the Deputy and my supervisor Dean because they let me spend the money that I get to spend.,0,C1,05/16/2023
"but hopefully, you'll get more we're working on it. But thank you so much for your presentation. We've got one more item, C2. What I'd like to suggest is rather than taking a lunch break let's just take a really quick bathroom break.",0,C1,05/16/2023
