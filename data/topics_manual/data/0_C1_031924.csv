Natural Energy of Hawai‘i Laboratory Authority’s Request for Modification of Special Conditions 1a and 1d of the Well Construction Permit for the Ota Well (State Well No. 8-3957-006)
PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Ryan Imata, Ground Water Regulation Branch Chief; Gregory Barbour & Dr. Alex Leonard, Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority (NELHA) Staff gave an informational briefing on the status of the Ota Well.
Can you describe the Ota Well? You always talk about the Ota Well but what’s the capacity? Just describe it briefly.
The Ota Well is a proposed well that’s planned to be drilled in the high level band in the Keauhou region and it’s above the Kaloko Honokohau National Park but Queenie, it’s to the south? I don’t think it’s in the particular ahupuaʻa that was being looked at for the Keauhou designation. Nonetheless, the Commission did require some special conditions attached to the issuance of the permit.
What was the capacity?
It’s pretty large, yeah Queenie? It’s over 400 gallons per minute.
And the purpose?
The purpose was to primarily I think to supply the Kamakana development. It is a mixed-use development.
Maybe explain the applicants.
Sorry, I know you’re coming at this without too much context. The applicants are Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority and HHFDC (Hawaiʻi Housing Finance & Development Corporation) are the applicants and the well is intended to be dedicated to the Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply at some point. I think that’s it.
Larry, I think HHFDC intended for it to be an affordable, it was a housing project Kamakana Villages in Kona. NELHA was also going to get an allocation of that water for their facility and then the rest, they would eventually dedicate the system to Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply.
It’s into the caprock?
It’s in the high-level band in Keauhou where all of the high-capacity production wells are.
Do we have a map or anything?
I’m sorry, I’ll send you one after.
How deep is the shaft?
I don’t know, sorry.
Maybe you can send us the original application so we know what they’re proposing.
I think there were several of us who were probably not here when that decision was made.
Got it, I should have been more comprehensive in my presentation.
Aloha, my name is Greg Barbour, I’m the executive director at the Natural Energy Lab here in Kailua-Kona. I have with me Dr. Alex Leonard, our project manager and Dean Minakami from HHFDC was here earlier but had to go to the Capitol. He sends his apologies for not being able to stay. I can provide a summary of what we are requesting in our modifications and thank you for making the time for us. Like Ryan said, this informational briefing we wanted to give you an idea of what we’re thinking and trying to get some feedback and have a public forum for discussing our proposal. I do have a map and I will give some more background to the project. I want to start by thanking Chair Chang. Immediately after session she invited Dean, who is the executive director of HHFDC and myself to meet with her and she gave us very good guidance and gave us some direction. She said that if you’re interested in avoiding a contested case hearing, if you’re interested in resolving this and trying to make a request to CWRM board for modification, then the ball is in our court, is what she told us. She said we have to go out and do our homework and she suggested that we go out and talk to all the stakeholders in the area in West Hawaiʻi, on the island of Hawaiʻi and we did that. First of all, we came up with a proposal for modification for the two items that Ryan showed on his slide deck and then we started talking to people. Actually, now it’s been over a hundred people, in the past six months over 30 different organizations. Our discussions included lineal descendants of the area, cultural descendants of the area, as well. Aha Moku, we reached out to the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation and I think they’re here today, and then we talked with a number of government agencies including the Division of Aquatic Resources, the Division of Forestry. We talked with the Department of Health, we talked with DHHL Hawaiian Home Lands, which by the way they’re a partner with us in this project in addition to HHFDC. We talked with the county Planning Department, we talked with the county Housing Department, we talked with the mayor’s office, we talked with the county water supply. We talked with a number of private developers in in West Hawaiʻi, including Liliʻuokalani Trust, we talked with Lanihau Partners, I think we talked with one other developer but the name escapes me. Kamehameha Schools, we talked with them. I think we did our homework, I think we did follow Chair Chang’s advice. I think we have very good, proposed modifications that make much more sense. They clarify what’s being proposed in terms of the conditions and so I’d like to explain those to you right now, if I could share my screen.
Let me just clarify one point, Greg. I do not recall advising you to avoid a contested case, but I did nonetheless advise because both HHFDC and NELHA were not comfortable with the modifications. I did say you do have a permit, if you want those conditions modified, I would encourage you to meet with the community and then come back. After you’ve met with the community and developed a proposed modification of those conditions and we can bring that back to the Water Commission. That’s kind of where we are. Over the year, you’ve done the outreach. Based upon that outreach, you’re going to present to us these proposed modifications. I don’t know who else is on this call, but if there’s any lawyers on this call and if I advise you’re not going to get sued, I probably could get in trouble. Don’t worry, please go ahead with your presentation.
Sorry, Chair for misspeaking, I think you’re correct in [inaudible]. Here’s a map. This is Kailua-Kona town here. This is the Queen Kaʻahumanu Highway here. This is the upper-level road right through here. This is our well site, it is proposed for 1.0 million gallons. This is the Honuaʻula Forest Reserve which is part of condition 1a and this in the blue is the ahupuaʻa for this wellsite and it’s shown here. The proposed use of the water would be one-third for NELHA and that would be 330,000 gallons. One-third would be for HHFDC, Hawaii Housing Finance Development Corporation. They have an affordable housing project probably in this area right here generally just above town and they would get 330. DHHL, we entered into an agreement with them that we would provide them 2.6% of the water, so less than a third for sure, 2.6%. The way it works with the County of Hawaiʻi is that you drill the well, you develop the well, and then you dedicate that well to the County and they keep one-third peak use. We’ll end up with only one-third and HHFDC will end up with one-third. HHFDC, their development at Kamakana Village is stopped because they cannot get water credits, so this well if it was drilled and it was approved for use would provide up to an additional 2,000 affordable housing units in West Hawaiʻi that are badly needed. That’s kind of a summary background of our project. The condition, I believe it’s 1a that Ryan showed, we originally were opposed to that, completely opposed to that because we had no idea where that funding would go. We wanted to be assured that that money would be used to preserve that Honuaʻula Forest Reserve and after numerous discussions with the Division of Forestry, we came to an agreement that that water would be used to build a fence line generally in this area. I say generally but it’s basically straight across here and that that would be to keep the ungulates out of the upper-level area, I believe. They’re really trying to protect this native species in this area and we agreed as long as there’s a specified use for those fundings and we could be assured that that money would be used for that fence line. Then we came to an agreement where we’re not opposing condition 1a anymore. We are saying that in the yellow that these payments would be limited for a period of 30 years and not in perpetuity and then like Ryan said, we had been discussing this with Kaleo between the August approval. We were going to come back for reconsideration in October of 2022 and I’m not exactly sure what happened, why that was not agreed to. The items in red were items that Kaleo had agreed to and it was just really for clarification that that funding would be used for that forest reserve indicated there. That’s a summary of that. Maybe I stop there and ask if there are any questions?
Thank you for your contributions and your willingness to negotiate some of these terms rather than have us all stuck in a fruitless contested case. The first, I want to applaud all the outreach you did, I mean we thought the work that Kaleo started, that Chair Chang is also supporting of really having the community reach out and talk to each other directly rather than have us be the arbiter of different perspectives, is really the way to go. Seems like you embraced that. I hope that you feel that you have a better understanding of how to align with their values and the expectations of the other stakeholders in this system. I want to applaud that work. The condition 1a ties to a sense of worldview or concept of reciprocity that for the benefit of the use, we have an obligation to contribute to the protection and the enhancement of the source. I think it’s fine to make that direct and so that that contribution you’re making goes right to the source of the Honuaʻula Forest Reserve. That’s terrific and it may be used for fencing or they may have other great uses for that money. I don’t think we’re going to specify to them how to use it, but I think that’s good. What bothers me a little bit is 30 years. I don’t know where 30 years comes from. I understand a business wants to cap its liability, I get that, but to me that should be associated as we originally intended for the life of the well, not in perpetuity for the life of the well. If your well has no use after 20 years, why should you be paying for this for another 10? Likewise, if your well has a useful life of 50 years, why should you not be paying, making a contribution to that source from which you’re drawing benefit for the 20 years beyond the 30 that you’re proposing? I just have an issue with that because I think what we’re trying to do and not just with you but with other users and we’ve talked about this from Maui, where is the contribution of the system users to the system source? I think we’re exploring more ways to create that attachment and I just hope you’d reconsider the original language we had there of tying it to the life of the well.
Thank you for that input, Commissioner. That’s why we’re having this informational briefing today, really get a reading if the Commission feels that we’re headed in the right direction.
I think in many ways you are, so I appreciate it.
I want to add to that, Greg. I, too, appreciate that you took it very seriously and took to heart the recommendation of engaging with the community. I want you to know I am trying to work with CWRM on how can we be equitable so that we’re not just charging the last person in, so that there is a system of, how do we assess all well permitees to share in the benefit because we haven’t historically and regularly done that. I do want you to understand that we are looking at this from a holistic department view on how can we be more equitable in sharing the cost of watershed management, sharing the cost of administering, monitoring the program. Again, just appreciate this discussion, your consideration, the fact that you took this very seriously. I want to be very clear, we are not expecting NELHA, HHFDC to bear this burden on your own, we will be looking at all users and having them share in the contributions. As Neil said, reciprocity for this is a shared responsibility for all of us, all users. How do we ensure that that’s equitably distributed?
Condition 1d, and I want to make a correction that the second to last slide that Ryan had in his slide deck, we made an error. We should have deleted that before we sent it in. Those are amendments to 1d and what we’re saying is the last page that he had is what we’re proposing to replace it with. I can explain that to you in a minute. The idea of 1d is it was very broad. It was hard to understand what the purpose was. It was monitoring the waters offshore from the old airport, which is where my mouse is now, for the two miles down to the Kona Surf Hotel. It was offshore monitoring. After we talked to experts in the field and after we understood that no one is doing nearshore onshore monitoring of the basal lens, so before the water gets to the ocean, there’s absolutely no monitoring in West Hawaiʻi, as far as I know. Maybe down at the park but generally it’s the missing link. If you’re trying to understand our position, if you’re trying to understand the impacts of pulling water out of the basal lens from this well, which by the way is around 1,800 ft, so it’s tapping that basal lens which comes out along the shoreline, what we’re proposing is we would drill two monitoring wells. Those are the dots in yellow here. One is at the old airport on state property, one would be in downtown in Kailua-Kona on state property behind the Queen’s Palace. Talking with lineal descendants, they had indicated that there used to be a spring in that area and that’s state property. Another proposed location that in discussion with the County of Hawaiʻi, they also have a park further down, that magenta dot there, is so we could drill three wells. The idea is that we would be able to monitor the basal lens before it reaches the ocean. That will give you a much better idea of the anthropogenic impacts on the basal lens rather than if you’re sampling offshore. There are a number of other variables and it’s hard to understand causal relationships. Is it global warming, was there a lot of rainfall, climate change condition, rising seawater? Monitoring the offshore water is not going to help understand the impacts of the basal lens because it’s already entered the ocean. That’s our position. We talked to a lot of people, nobody has disagreed with us on that condition and I think it’s an elegant solution that Alex, Dr. Leonard came up with, especially since it’s the missing link. It’ll provide a lot of information and that’s what we’re proposing versus offshore monitoring. The other two sites would be the orange dots and those are two of the anchialine ponds in this area. We currently monitor 120 sites every 90 days. We’ve done that for over 30 years both onshore and offshore. We have 34 monitoring wells here at NELHA and we’re just at the north end of this picture here. We also have four anchialine ponds that we monitor and we do that every 90 days. Our water quality lab staff feels comfortable that we could complete this monitoring and have very credible data. We are an EPA certified lab and I think our people do very good work. It would provide a lot of good baseline information to West Hawaiʻi, to understand what’s going on. One of the bright spots of this proposed modification is that a lot of other people said that this could turn into a regional monitoring program for all of West Hawaiʻi. If we had other monitoring wells along the shoreline, onshore, and these wells, we don’t know how deep they would be, perhaps 35 ft, perhaps 50 ft. That’s something that we can discuss as we move forward. If we had a regional monitoring system along the shoreline of the basal lens, that would be invaluable to a lot of the decision makers in this field. I think it would be very valuable to your agency, as well. I know that when we talked with the Division of Aquatic Resources, they were all in favor and I would say excited about this proposal. They do offshore monitoring. Some of what we were going to do in the original condition would be duplicative, so they were supportive. I’ll stop there, but I think it’s an elegant solution. I think it will provide a lot of very good information to decision makers for the future. I’ll stop there.
I don’t think I was aware of that monitoring framework. What are you measuring and monitoring for every 90 days and then is this reported to an agency? What’s done with the data that you guys have been collecting for years?
That was part of our original permit conditions when we got a CDUP for our project which began 50 years ago. We submit an annual report every year and we put it online. All of our information is online for everyone to see, basically to understand the impact of what we’re doing here. Is there any impact on the offshore waters? I don’t have the list with me, but I do...how many?
Dozens of parameters, what we would call Standard Marine Water Quality Parameters, anything from physical characteristics to chemistry such as various nitrogen species, phosphorous species, inorganic solutes, turbidity. It’s a fairly extensive list. Basically, we’re looking for any signature that would indicate contribution of runoff from land into the nearshore marine environment.
Do you have any bioindicators that are part of that suite?
We have what we call our annual biota survey. We have a number of transects set up offshore, they’re surveyed to do reef fish counts and coral health and growth, coral abundance assessments. We monitor that over time, as well.
And the anchialine ponds have their own different metrics?
Have their own specific program, yes.
So, this is adding on new sites into an existing framework?
That’s the idea, yes absolutely. Let me just say that the details of the proposal for the Lanihau monitoring program are not worked out yet. The language of the original conditions was quite vague, very open-ended. I think the intent was for us to sit down with CWRM and other stakeholders and work out the details later. We intentionally kept it that way in our response now because we’d like to include everybody to make sure that we are answering the questions that people feel are important. From our perspective, this gives us a window on the groundwater as it flows into the ocean. It gives the opportunity to look for man’s impact on that water flow both in terms of quantity and quality. We have the option to look for trace chemicals, petrochemicals, run off from streets and then also very importantly because of the ongoing discussion about the hydrology of this area, it gives us a much better opportunity to look at tracer studies to look at where the water is actually coming from.
I really appreciated you embracing this challenge and designing a model that was relevant and appropriate for both the community as well as our intention. I know that DAR, they do a lot of offshore monitoring. Rather than being duplicative, what I understand is you found the gaps, where’s the missing data points, and designing this framework and it was in consultation. Alex, I would like you to talk a little bit about your experience doing the outreach because I know you did a lot of it and the benefits that you got. One other point I’d like to make is I know that Keith Okamoto with Hawaiʻi DWS, he too is embracing this regional approach. Hawaiʻi County is looking at identifying inventory, where are all the monitoring wells, and where can they supplement that. I don’t even know if we could have even come up with this model, but I think for me at CWRM and with DLNR, we are looking for good data and this is a good approach to get us that information to look at mauka to makai. I know you did share previously because you did a lot of the outreach and I think I’d like the Commission to get a flavor of the people that you spoke to and some of the discussions and just how you walked away given your community engagement.
Thank you, Chair Chang. Where we really started with this was trying to understand what was at the root of the questions being asked by the community. When Covid hit and we were unable to hold the community meetings that had been proposed for these discussions, Kaleo took it upon himself to go out and reach out to people himself, had these hālāwai meetings with a number of lineal and cultural descendants and in conjunction with ʻAha Moku. They came up with these series of recommendations but mostly it was a question about man’s impact on the environment. They came and it was really Kaleo, I believe, who came up with the idea of the biological monitoring plan that was the original proposal for 1d. That’s something that is easy to point at. The concern is, is the groundwater flowing into the environment impacting resources, fish for example or ʻōpihi, or limu along the shoreline? Very valid questions but it was hard for us to get our hands around what was behind those questions and because we’re missing this piece in the middle. Talking with, for example, Charlie Young who was present in those meetings, he fully embraced this idea because it really got to the heart of the community’s concerns. That’s really what they want, that’s really what people want to know and because they are concerned about the bigger picture, but nobody had yet come up with a way of getting to where they wanted to get to. Talking with neighboring landowners and developers and all of them seemed very keen, very eager to see this happen because they understand that what really is needed here is a regional network. If we’re going to be responsible about our resource conservation and management efforts, we need more information than we have. Overwhelmingly, people were supportive of that concept, applying this elsewhere. I reached out to the people that had been originally consulted by Kaleo, principally it’s the Kanuha family who are lineal descendants of this area and I’ve had a number of conversations with Jerome Kanuha about this and he assures me that he speaks for his family and the ʻohana. He was very supportive of this, he says that this goes to the heart of the community’s concerns and he’s very keen to see particularly the site in downtown Kailua-Kona being evaluated because that was his grandmother’s property at one point in time. He remembers there being a natural spring that emerged at that location, so he again is very supportive. I think that’s about it.
Chair, I join you in commending the effort and the work that you proposed, really adds value. You could have just taken an easy way out or a cheaper way out and so forth but you try to do the right thing to help us all understand. I think that’s commendable. For our written record, I just want to correct something Greg said, that the area is from the old Kona Airport State Recreation Area to Royal Kona Resort. I think you said Kona Surf, it’s to the Royal. It’s not that broad, it’s to the Royal Kona. Yeah, thank you.
Ryan, for my verification the last slide in red, does that replace the entire 1d?
Yes, I believe that’s what Greg was saying.
Yes.
To clarify, they’re going to pay for this.
There are other parts of 1d that if you look at...
What I did was I basically copied this from NELHA’S letter to us because it was represented that the yellow highlights were their proposed changes, then Kaleo had done the stuff in red. There wasn’t a way to cross out the second to last page and represent that that’s what the applicant was proposing. They are proposing to replace it.
Replace the entire section. That’s helpful.
At the beginning of that, working with practitioners and ʻohana and DAR and so forth, are we going to lose that language because I think they’ve done that?
That was my question. 
That should be retained.
Okay, that makes sense. See Ryan, on the original one it says working with practitioners and ʻohana, but on the one they took that out. I think you’re right because it more accurately reflects their outreach. When I came on board, Ota Well was this crisis, nothing is going to move forward without Ota Well. If you’ve known me after a year, I’m process but I’m also about staying in our lane and in my view it is the applicant’s responsibility to do the outreach, not the department. I think Kaleo felt it wasn’t happening so he wanted to do it, but I think having the applicant go out there and do this, they were able to fashion something so much more meaningful and so much more relevant given their own expertise, as well.
Greg mentioned that at the end of the day, the well was going to be turned over to DOW (referring to the Department of Water Supply). The applicant is somebody else, how does all of these conditions and responsibilities fall and who becomes ultimately responsible? Again, just to help me balance the equation on this process because we have a lot of conditions here generally.
Maybe discussing with Greg, perhaps with the dedication of the well to Department of Water Supply, the responsibility for the conditions of this then falls upon Department of Water Supply. Is that kind of what you’re saying?
These conditions would be applied to NELHA and HHFDC. I can tell you in discussions with DWS that a condition of dedicating that well to the County would be that we continue to pay for these conditions.
So, you would be responsible for the monitoring, the reporting?
Yes, we’ve agreed to do that. It’s not an issue as far as we’re concerned.
I guess you triggered this and I had to think about it, Chair. Under 1a on that fee that we’re assessing, you said that would be an approach and holistic pattern. Have we determined that policy on how these fees and how it’s going to be, or is this a one off?
the intention is we will have conversations both with CWRM and even the AG’s office. Do we need to do a rule amendment, can we just put that as a condition? I don’t know what the answer is, all I know is I think the outcome has to be a more equitable sharing of these costs.
In determining that amount and for that period of that, are we there?
Dean, are we there?
I don’t need an answer, but philosophical question. If you’re going to put in for lack of a better word, tax on users.
Registration fee.
It’s a fee, it’s not a tax.
Whatever you want to call it, a license or whatever it is. Is a mechanism in place for this process to be equitable and not arbitrary and capricious? I don’t need an answer right now.
It’s a very specific number, can you shed light on how it was calculated?
No, I don’t. I wasn’t involved in the...
I think it was proportional to the amount of pumpage of the well.
Again, you’re focusing on one user and that is not equitable. I don’t need an answer today.
But it may be the one-time fee up front is based upon a calculation then there’s an annual registration fee that you pay every year. We have not worked out the details, but I think that is the goal because in talking to NELHA and HHFDC, that was an issue. How come we’re the only one that’s being charged this? Point well taken. It made me think, okay I think we have to find a more equitable way. It’s not that we can say we’re not going to do it, but how do we equitably distribute especially for those who already have a well permit. How do we make them share in this because they have limited capacity and to go out and monitor and to do all these other great things, we need capacity or we need resources. This is something we are exploring.
But in this case this applicant has also agreed to other conditions in terms of establishing monitoring ongoing.
It’s probably a good model for us to look at for future applicants who have similar kinds of requests.
I agree.
This is not a water management area, correct? Everybody has equal rights that are correlative rights of overlying landowners. The issue in the future is that suppose this well goes in and we start seeing some effects, it’s not just this landowner that has to decrease their use. All the others have to do it in some equitable way and if someone else comes in later on and it affects it, it’s not first come first served in this area. It has to be, so that’s an issue we’re going to have to face as long as we’re not in a water management area. I also want to raise the issue for now is that we’re placing a whole lot of mandatory conditions on this well drilling permit. We had a discussion about that before, that’s all I got to say about that.Fair point. Part of this was they wanted to move forward, NELHA and HHFDC, contested case hearing was filed, encouraged them to meet with the community to come up with some conditions that would be more acceptable to them. As a result, they withdrew their contested case. That’s not to say that somebody else may not file a contested case, but at least they have found a path forward.
But if we put it in the conditions, a different issue all together.
I’m Loke Aloua, my attorney Ashley Obrey of Native Hawaiian Legal Corp has submitted testimony and I’m not going to regurgitate that. I just hope that there can be some answers to what the process is going to be moving forward with responses to our hui’s questions, for NELHA regarding these revisions that they are requesting. That’s one thing for sure and then I just have just some other comments so please look at the letter. I’m not going to recover it, but I keep hearing the term equity thrown around in this meeting and I really have to say, there is no equity until there’s true justice for the illegal seizures of Hawaiian lands and waters by the continued illegal US occupation. NELHA sits on 800 acres of stolen land. These people were evicted upon NELHA’s creation. Families were taken off these lands and if you look back through the historical record since 1848, Native Hawaiians have been asking for access to these lands to live on and they’ve been denied that access. This is just a continuation of that colonial legacy of denying Native Hawaiians land while also creating the situation of not enough housing. We have 800 acres at NELHA, we have at least 500 million gallons of water being used there, we have zero homes, zero families housed, but somehow they have access to all of these resources. We cannot be talking about equity in this space until we’re talking about true justice. What we’re trying to do is damage control. The other thing is you folks keep talking about a regional approach. The Department of Water Supply hasn’t provided an updated water use and development plan to provide the regional approach that we’re looking for. This well by well is not going to work. We need something that’s updated which this Commission has asked for under Chair Case. You guys had a lot of really great comments for the Department of Water Supply and somehow those plans are not provided. We have environmental reviews right now sitting on our laps for two more wells that are already waiting for this to move through. Josh Green has secured $5 million from the legislature this year for this project, which is still going through the consultation process, I’m critiquing the process, we’re uplifting NELHA when really we need to be uplifting Kaleo because Kaleo is the reason that this had worked out. Without Kaleo, I’m really curious how this going to work moving forward because he was a source of trust for the community. He really held us together, he brought us together, and it’s not to knock on NELHA’S efforts but it’s to really put Kaleo back in his place. Another comment on Kaleo is ever since Kaleo left, we’ve been left in the dust. That was partly my concern which I shared with Kaleo. When Kaleo was in the position I said Kaleo, what going to happen when you no stay? What can happen to us as a community? He said just trust the process and Kaleo isn’t here and that’s not Kaleo’s fault, but it shows that if Kaleo’s not here what’s next for us as community members? I’m requesting transparency over the process to really know what to expect next because I’ll be honest, ever since Kaleo left it kind of just feels like NELHAs going to do what they want. We asked NELHA, okay we have to take some time to think about what they gave us, so we asked them, hey we have some other additional comments. It was like a stroke of a brush, hey guess what you guys like know, you guys go CWRM, you guys go sit inside a meeting and then that’s when we’re going to address your concerns. That’s not community. I’ve never ever told anybody in my community as somebody who’s responsible to my community that kine answer. That’s not one answer. I just really need your guys help, CWRM, please help with the water use and development plan. Please help to get us some answers for the questions we have. We just want to know and we would like it in a written document so that we can have it for our documents and to share with our keiki about what is exactly happening here. Even if in the end things are going to stay as they are because I’m just me, I’m just trying to bring some things forward. In the end, we need some radical realigning because climate disaster is on its way. My family and I was just in Lahaina running away from those fires and I tell you taking water from the aquifer, you’re increasing the surface air temperature, all of those temperatures everything is rising and everything is in sync. What happened in Lahaina is happening in Kona and we’re lineal descendants of Lahaina and we moved to Kona because we’re lineal descendants of Kona from my grandma’s side. Now we’re getting the same issue repeating itself in Kona and nobody here, not even me, should be tapping my back telling me I did one good job because we have so much that we have to repair. There’s so much that we have to prioritize. Kona needs help. There’s two more wells coming, 2 more million gallons. If we’re looking at projections USGS gave you folks for what the recharge might be, looking at mid-century we’re looking at a decline of 33 - 53%. That leaves us with just a few million gallons of water left under your folks equation for sustainable yield, but folks are saying today, hey the outdated plan is final, the WUDP, therefore we get more, there’s more water to use. That’s a problem. Sustainable yield is changing, it shouldn’t have changed. That doesn’t indicate environmental health but then at the same time we’re talking about, this is really great for regional approaches. There is no regional approach. This is well by well. We want regional approach, too. Please help us, I know you guys know this because a lot of you guys we’ve seen but we need that WDP updated. NELHA, you need to do better. This isn’t your first time, you’ve been in Kona a long time, you need to do better to show up for your community and to help us because this is the only first time you’re doing this kind monitoring. Show up for Kona. Pau already guys come take, take, take, no can. I talk to businesses at NELHA and they tell me we get issues with NELHA. We need transparency over the process as well because not everybody that should have been in these meetings was talked to. I talked to kuleana landholders who have title in Lanihau, they never was talked to and that’s not to say that all the people that were talked to weren’t valuable, but it is to say that we still aren’t getting the people that we need to at the table. We just need more transparency and I’m also bringing this up because I’m asking for transparency from future wells that we work with ʻAha Moku and outside of ʻAha Moku because not everybody believes or can trust ʻAha Moku yet. We need a process for the broader community to come in because I cannot be sitting over here giving all these answers to everybody because it’s really not all fine and dandy. It’s not all good, you guys. Please help us. Thank you, but please help us.
I really appreciate your time on this issue. I’m here with Loke and Kimberly, who’s also on the call. They’re part of Hui Ola Ka Wai who’s been a part of this process for quite some time now since this well was first proposed. With this long history of how things have gone and the well-being, decision making on the well at first being deferred for the purpose of consultation, trying a little bit better to understand the impacts. The year and a half long process that Kaleo went through of talking to community, a number of meetings, a number of discussions and drafts to reach like some consensus on the conditions that were approved back in August 2022. Then there was this really long pause after NELHA’s request for contested case hearing and not sure what was going on and my client Hui Ola Ka Wai had not heard anything from NELHA until January 31st. My understanding from this meeting is that there had been discussions being had for about six months, so it’s a little frustrating because I think this hui has been a part of the process from the get-go and rightly so, there’s expectation that we would have been among the first talked to. Not to say the only ones talked to, I agree with everything Loke said. There are a lot more people in the community and I don’t think it’s the burden of Hui Ola Ka Wai or anybody to go tell NELHA who they should be talking to but there needs to be a better process to make sure more community is involved. I think that would have been remedied by more open-door meetings, public meetings and just more advanced notice. The WDP is important, we keep talking about this regional approach, the necessity of really thinking through how best to approach Kona’s water at this point. This is the first well since the failed designation, this is setting the tone for everything that comes after because this is in a designated area. There’s no regional plan to rely on so there’s just a lot of concerns and I think we put a lot in our testimony, it’s about four pages. The process is really important, I think that’s the bottom line. We can appreciate that this is an effort to increase mitigation efforts and I think mitigation is always great, obviously, but without going through the process, without really understanding the impacts, without talking to all the right people or at least creating opportunity for all the right people to sit in the room, it just makes it hard to know where things are going. I think Loke also pointed to the fact that there were some concerns that were raised in the emails back and forth between myself and NELHA addressing some of the concerns we had about the red lines and things and so there was still some outstanding questions. There were some modifications that we would have requested and maybe some of it was touched on today, but not really. If we can force some of that information out before any kind of decision making down the line, I think that’s really important as well. Just to reiterate the comments that Hui Ola Ka Wai just really wants us to all get on the same page in terms of what’s next for water for Kona and how we can work together to make this a process that really works for the community. I think that’s all.
Can I ask you, what would you want to see as your as process? What are you recommending?
We put general bullets in the testimony, I don’t want to completely read everything but I’m going to reference it so that I don’t miss anything. We’re talking about ensuring that there are these open meetings, that it’s not just like we’re going to make a few phone calls here and there and talk to a hundred people, but I don’t really know who’s been talked to. I don’t know who was invited to these meetings outside of the select few that were chosen and I’m not sure how those people were chosen in the first place. Figuring out ways to make things more open and transparent. I may not have the perfect solution, but I’m trying to throw out these ideas. Working on that water use and development plan, I don’t know how we engage DWS in the right way to get things moving.
Have you asked them?
I have not recently, I have not. It has been raised in the past. I’m trying to remember at a meeting, some kind of finance meeting a while back. It’s been at least over a year for sure.
That’s really their schedule, right? We will encourage them.
I think it’s important, we’re thinking about the public trust and our kuleana, your kuleana, not you specifically, but as a body, as the State to make sure that these resources are managed properly for future generations. You can’t do that without those plans and those plans are part of the Code and the whole thing. I think that’s an important step and maybe that would play, the next bullet that we shared in the testimony, talking about requiring full environmental study for all wells. Whether or not that’s a requirement under the law I think that’s part of the planning process. Just thinking through what this is going to look like yeah from a regional perspective and how all these wells will work together long term. It’s all there and I don’t mean to just reiterate, but I think there’s some things in the written testimony that could be helpful. I know there are others who want to speak so I’ll be here for questions if anything.
Aloha Chair, Commissioners, and Deputy. Again, we have more of our detailed points in our testimony submitted by Ashley and Native Hawaiian Legal Corp. Today I just really wanted to remind us why all of these conditions are so important and as times have changed I feel like it is important that the way that we make decisions change. When we’re throwing around the word equitable to everybody and how we start imposing, what’s it registration fees and things like that, reminding us that as we grow smarter, as we grow wiser, these things are what come with that kuleana that we carry. As we’ve been hosting students for the last spring session, one of my favorite things to reiterate is this full circle connection from mauka to makai because we’re drawing the water from up mauka but it does in fact make its way makai and the importance of every single drop of that water. If you can imagine the way the forests used to look with the koa, with the kukui, with the ‘ulu, with the ferns, with the lichen, and everything in between and how that water used to be purified and put into the aquifer and then that water would make its way down to the kai where it would grow all of the diatoms. It would grow all of the limus, it would grow the phytoplankton and the zooplanktons, and that would feed our nearshore fisheries, our reef fish, our herbivores, and it would work its way up the chain. It would then feed our predators. When our herbivores and our predators and our reef fish would spawn, that spawn would go out into the ocean and feed our pelagic, it would feed our whales, it would feed our ‘ahi, would feed all of these mea ‘ono that we have out there that we are so fond of in Kona. Kona gets to be known as the sports fishing capital of the world and I just kind of want to reiterate that and kind of share the irony that we are allowing this well to be permitted for NELHA who wants to increase their growth capacity of these fish in cages in the name of resource management and sustainability by removing those resources from their place where they’re supposed to be. I think what they’re doing is just barely scraping the top of what their kuleana is to give back. Although housing is needed and all of these things are needed in Kona, we live in a multigenerational family house, it’s really important that we step back and think about what the damage is done what would be better and how to move forward in the most pono way. I think they’re really just scraping the top of the barrel of what their kuleana needs to be to give back to the community in their capacity of taking. Mahalo.
We had a couple well permits today and I’ve been thinking in the case of where we have surface waters, the Commission works with USGS to have stream gauges but we really haven’t thought as much as maybe we should about those groundwater connections. Hawaii island, in particular, the streams aren’t on the surface, so how do we do our due diligence in terms of monitoring? Sure, there’s deep monitoring wells, but maybe there’s some lighter weight methods. I don’t know what they are, it does sound like what NELHA has proposed at the near onshore basal monitoring is probably...I don’t know what the costs are but they do seem useful and more feasible. Each island is different. On Hawaiʻi island, all the water comes out below ground. It doesn’t have to be massively expensive geophysical research. That’s nice, university does it, but I think there needs to be different approaches to monitoring and I do think that community members have a lot of knowledge. They know where the punawai are, they know where the luʻuwai are and that’s information that I think we need for decision making. It’s better if it doesn’t have to emerge out of these conflicts. I would like to see us also request the water use development plan updates from Hawaiʻi County, just to say how’s it going, what’s the status, and create that forum so it’s not individuals who are frustrated who are having to ask. The other comment I have is less for staff, but I ask to testifiers. I think it seems like NELHA has made a good faith effort, but I work in the sciences and oftentimes people are intimidated by community or may not know who in the community to talk to or understand the texture of that community. What is the ability of a group and they pointed out that not everybody trusts Aha Moku. Aha Moku is what we see on the state side, but what’s the ability of Hui Ola Ka Wai to convene or help identify who isn’t being talked to because I think it’s a little hard to assume that NELHA knows or has the pull or has the credibility. They might invite someone to talk, but what if they don’t show up? Is there some way for a community organization like Hui Ola Ka Wai to create some of that space? I’ll just put it out there, maybe it’s naive of me. I’m new to this Ota Well conflict and Keauhou failed designation preceded me, but I do see some kuleana on the Commission side and opportunities for helping us do the right thing.
Katie and Kaleo sought federal funds for more monitoring and they were successful. We’ve been really pushing for, I’ve been pushing very hard to do more data collection with different monitoring. Can we give an update on that, Julie? It’s not on the agenda.
It’s not part of the agenda, maybe next meeting. 
Okay, maybe next time we can do that.
May I ask if you can give a little historical context on that contribution of $13,940?
I can’t, I didn’t come up with the number. I think that’s described in 8/16/2022. I was actually thinking about this when I sent you guys the original application and some of the information. I’ll also send you all the submittals that describe that. Sorry, I can’t answer that off the top of my head.
If I may, the formula that they came up with was actually something that had been proposed as part of the leasing process for East Maui in order for the applicant in that case to help fund the watershed management plan. Rather than reinvent the wheel per 171-58(e), the applicant is supposed to come with the watershed management plan, but in that case a watershed management plan already exists. How can they basically help support implementation of that plan? In this case for the Ota Well, they hold that formula that they use in that case and it’s in the submittal where it’s water use in MGD / available water in MGD * the annual management cost. There is a watershed management plan for the Honuaʻula Forest Reserve and so that’s where the total cost for that was identified as $525,500 per year. Based on the water use and the available water came up to that amount. That’s all in the submittal and I believe there’s a table of values in the back of...
Where’s that other 498,000? Where is it? 
DOFAW (Division of Forestry and Wildlife).
So, they want to tax themselves on that, feed themselves on that?
They have to go and get that money. They seek funding, they seek federal partners, other watershed partners, but that’s what it costs them to fence, to manage that watershed.
I understand that part of it, but there’s a bunch of water of which a million gallons is for this. What about the rest?
That’s what I say, what about the rest?
But you can’t get there in one step. We take a little step forward and start to reinstitute this nexus between the users and the source, but do we drop all the federal or state funding we get for watershed management? No, we’re going to take that while we can and create a better balance of contribution between the users and generic contributors through tax payments or philanthropy. I just feel like directionally, we’re correct. We are far from there, but it’s a step you take and then the next one and the next one that gets us closer.
I guess the question is equity. We’ve had testimony on that.
But if a system is not logical, how do we move from an illogical system to a logical one if we’re going to protect equity? Because equity now is, nobody has to pay.
It’s like building a toll bridge, this is the structure of the toll. Beginning today we will now assess a toll on whoever is using this resource, whether it’s a road, a river, or a well.
But it’s not just going forward, how do we bring everybody else who’s...
That’s this toll concept is that you’re using it whether you’ve been using it for the last 10 years or today. If you’re going to use it, you got to pay for it.
Yes, so that’s a registration fee, annual registration. 
Whatever it is, whatever path forward.
At least we have some mechanism to determine based on a geographic...how would we determine what that start off is and then we can...The first time, that’s what you got to pay, but ongoing everybody’s got to put in some kind of a registration fee.
What does that look like? Is that like a rules amendment? A statutory thing?
Like I said, I’m not sure. I think it may be a rule amendment. If we want to start charging a fee because that’s rule making, how can we assess one person this and not? I think that’s what we’re working with the AG’s office, we do have a draft set of rules that have been prepared. We’re looking at that and it does include a fee structure. I think we’re moving in that direction. While we move forward, we still got to catch up and still do the day-to-day operations. It is a changing mindset, but we’re getting there. I do feel like we’re getting there step by step.
That probably won’t come before the Commission before I leave, but I’ll come as a private citizen to support it, absolutely. I’ll testify as favorable testimony.
Notwithstanding, I recognize it’s not a perfect solution but when applicants are required to go out there and do their outreach, many times they can fashion something that may be...
I agree with that. Is it the authority or the legitimacy of charging a fee?
We all have to pay a car registration fee. 
That is memorialized. 
We are finally moving in that direction.
I just want to pick up on Loke’s point that Kaleo played a valuable role here. I get the swim lane stuff, but sometimes there’s a valuable role to be played as to create an impetus or catalyst to bring parties together because we have staff who have great relationships across the paeʻāina and where they can help bring people who otherwise don’t know each other, they’re operating in their separate circles to talk and catalyze those discussions. I think it’s valuable, but it’s better if that’s happening in the community level.
More organic and it’s more relevant. 
Sometimes we have to stimulate it.
This one ended up causing us a little bit...but I think we’re back on track. We’re in the right direction, so I’m encouraged by where we are. I’m not saying it’s perfect and I’m not saying it’s going to, who knows there still could be a contestant case hearing notwithstanding this. I am about process, but it is about relationships at the end of the day. The applicant and the community have to have a relationship. We as a Commission and staff, we will step out but they have to have a relationship that sustains the resource as well as the implementation. Unless we create that opportunity for them to do that, we will continue to be the buffer and I have gotten my share of licks.
That’s what a buffer is!
But I don’t share it with anybody!
