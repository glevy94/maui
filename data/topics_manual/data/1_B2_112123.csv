Requesting Authority for the Chairperson to Enter Into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Department of Health to Receive Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Set-Aside Funding and Authority for the Chairperson to Enter into Contracts for Water Audit Training and Water Meter Testing Training
Neal Fujii, CWRM State Drought & Water Conservation Coordinator
I’ve discussed this with Neil already but you know that's $550,000 and I requested that we include some kind of digital recording or media. Because with this one-time funding or training, if we're interested in developing capacity we should think about the fact that there is workforce turnover and we need to ensure people get hired on after the workshops learn. You mentioned hopefully people will develop capacity but it would be good to not just hope. Maybe identify some metrics by which we know that we've spent this taxpayer money effectively, number of participants and maybe some other metrics that when we report back, we can demonstrate...
Absolutely, there's going to be a report, but we definitely should think about getting something...a YouTube video?
I’ll just say it would be nice to say two years from now we have saved X many million gallons of water by fixing leaks because of this added capacity.
Measure of effectiveness, absolutely.
I don't know the specific wording but while we have this chance to talk about it we just want to bring it up, that's all.
I think it's good because like I said I'm reading now, you had me on the on the search looking at previous minutes from Kauaʻi and I heard that's good. It’s going to be across islands and just the suggestion from Commission member that just mentioned having this recorded for trainings because I'm looking at the January 20, 2022 minutes, the draft minutes and it was talking about that chief engineer mentioning about benchmarks. There's no way to measure and the department does not have a pipe replacing program and the fact that right here, new people coming in, retired staff going out. It's good to have that available and for review. The second part to this that it's good for the meter, the reading, this training because of the fact that right now in ʻEwa Beach in the Gentry area it was brought up at the ʻEwa Beach neighborhood board meeting that there's apparently again a 15 million at the minimum, 25 million gallon per month leak from that development area. This one couple came forward, I mentioned it because the Board of Water Supply had threatened to turn off the water for like 621 families or homes. This type of issue really needs to be looked at. I don't know actually the role and the length and your coordination with this Commission with the Board of Water Supply and individual development areas but this type of issue is currently happening and it has apparently been happening for many months and years. This is a leak that they cannot find but because of the distinction between a private development and then the state or whatever that they can't go in. There was another issue brought up with Billingham and Brenton Awai. It's good that you guys have this monitoring and my question was do you have information about that from BOW? I don't know your working relationship and then knowing about leaks that are happening with water reading and water leaks because you're going to be doing this training. If that is related, which I thought it was, if that helps you for gathering input and for having this training available because apparently it's the issue in Kauaʻi meetings about meters and reading and all of everything that you're just discussing now for this MOA B-2.
