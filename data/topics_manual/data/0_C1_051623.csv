Summary on Current Fieldwork Activities in the Stream Protection and Management Branch, Statewide
Ayron, are other providers or entities also measuring, and do you all share information?
we are the largest cooperator of the USGS hydrological data collection network, but we're not the only funder. A lot of our stations are cost-shared with other entities. Outside of the USGS, I know of a few, the University of Hawai‘i or federal organizations that measure flow or maintain any monitoring sites. There is the Department of Health when they do some of their field work, they also measure flow at the location, but in many circumstances, the county just pays for the USGS to maintain a station or monitor for particular measurements, that sort of thing. There are a few non-profits that make flow measurements but I'm not aware of where they store that data.
Chair, we do come every August to renew and get approval from the commission to renew that cooperative agreement. We've asked USGS to do a similar presentation for this body, to go over their monitoring program and the details of their fieldwork that we're ultimately paying for in order to provide that data to us so, that's coming in August.
does DOT do any kind of monitoring?
they cost share. Most of their funding goes to crest-stage gauges. So, across the state, they fund hundreds of crest-stage gauges and where there's synergy with water commission’s efforts or USGS’s needs, we cost share stations; like in Waikapū, we added a natural flow USGS station to the cooperative agreement in the last couple of years. And it's being cost-shared with the Department of Transportation. So, they fund the peak flow estimates which involve a lot of modeling, a lot of work to measure stream channel contours, and that sort of thing. In order to expand the network with our limited funds we look for opportunities to cost share where possible.
does NOAA also participate in that, I ask because right now, there's a big nNational push with Cairo CIROH, and they're very flooding focused, so they want to have advanced warning and it just seems like everybody should hang out together.
from what I understand, NOAA only funds rainfall stations. They have their own network of rainfall stations and then, from what I've seen on their website; all their flood warning stations are all USGS stations that we fund.
you do a lot of work on quantity who does work on quality?
that falls under the Department of Health.
is there a way that you can cooperate in sort of cost-sharing some of that or these reach way beyond what they would need?
Well, we don't have regulatory authority over quality, so we don't fund quality monitoring.
but you're providing the data. I mean you're there in the stream looking at flows.
are you suggesting that staff support the Department of Health with the collection of samples for analysis of water quality? Is that what you're suggesting?
well can they help you provide money? I mean they must be spending money on doing that.
I'm not going to speak for DOH, but I do know that they have limited funds. There was an article about beach water quality monitoring, for example, on Maui they don't have the ability to monitor remote streams in the middle of the forest.
well, I mean the question will come up. If you look at sustainability long term is that a quantity and quality issue? And if we're going to start using surface water for potable needs, when do we start understanding what’s contributing to the quality of that water? At the end of your presentation, what is a balance that you need in terms of gauging stations or measurement capacity to get to a point where we understand where we can strike a balance in providing you know sustainable water sources for all the needs?
so, the commission supported the USGS study, looking at our Water Resource monitoring needs and there was a publication two years ago; now it's three years ago on where we need groundwater monitoring, where do we need streamflow monitoring, where do we need rainfall monitoring, and especially going into this period of climate uncertainty. We know where we need to monitor, we just don't have the funding to do it.
well, is there sort of a dream sheet where you kind of pencil out the funding requirements given the pressure or the interest in climate change?
definitely, and I presented that to the commission either last year or the year before that; given the constraints of USGS’s, ability to add stream gauges for example we could probably realistically add three to five USGS gauging stations each year to the cooperative agreement for the next 10 years. And then we would be at a much better place monitoring surface water resources across the state. And that's not to take anything away from what we do as staff. We would continue but we're at capacity. I'm hoping that we get to hire more staff in the near term, and I believe we do have funding to do that, but we are staff time and budget limited.
to touch on the Department of Health conversation both myself and Kathy the Deputy with DOH have talked about how we better coordinate and manage our resources and share data so that we both can effectively do our kuleana as it relates to us as well as Department of Health's Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act responsibilities. So, I think the goal of this Administration will work to kind of tighten up that relationship; understand that data sharing more clearly, and then how we can work better together across agencies on water quality and quantity.
quick question, so I was just thinking about the workload and what you guys are crucial for; all of it. But what can you potentially outsource- if have you thought about that- because your skills are valuable as a hydrologist. Are there other activities that could potentially be outsourced?
more money to hire USGS.
and the data processing; some of it’s automated but it still requires a real human so, is there something that takes most of your time? Just curious.
yeah QAQC. In terms of the amount of time that I'm not in the field. Obviously going in the field is a whole day. So usually, we're on the 5:45 or 6:15 a.m. flight and then we're back at seven or eight o'clock at night. And that’s a standard field day. We had a team yesterday go to Kaua‘i and they were on the 5:50 a.m. flight and back home at 8:00 p.m. flight landing at 8:40 p.m.. Then you have all the data that was gathered, you have to process that data, and so for every day I'm in the field, there's at least one day that you need to be in the office. I'm not available to do anything else during that period and it's not just me, it's a collective effort and we have a really solid team.
I will highlight that that is why when we have him available, he's pushing to be fully present in this conversation for the review of the data and proposed management recommendations. It’s one thing to collect the data, but then how is that data used for management recommendations is another part. Ayron is and his team is good at what they do. But it's shifting into item C2; so, we wanted to make sure we updated this body again and the public about what it takes to get the data. It does take time, money, and resources to do that.
when we have lawsuits, do we make that part of mitigation a requirement that they have to pay for monitoring and staff to monitor?
I mean this is an AG question potentially. But what we've been trying to do where somebody's diverting water we've made sure that they're one reporting their diverted amount of water that they're using. They either have to comply and meet the reporting requirements or we just recommend if you partner with us and USGS pays for the gages then it's an install; that it's kind of an upfront cost. But in the long term, you get this data that ensures that you're in compliance with the IIFS. So, there has been more focused effort I would say in the past four or five years to push, to have this sharing, this partnership in a regulatory compliance kind of perspective. We all benefit from good data. So, there's been that shift to try to see where we can partner and it's not a hundred percent Water Commission funding for this resource. We try to get those private partners on board. I’ll touch on this a little bit in item C2 focusing on where we can leverage other federal funding and programs to support the data collection needs of our staff and agency.
when you get others collecting data is there a quality assurance issue?
that is a big issue and one of the challenges on both sides. Whenever we've had enforcement actions brought before the commission, we try our best to use our data. We provide the opportunity for those bringing the complaint against to provide alternative data. Oftentimes they don't have that and so they've also seen the benefit of investing in their own data collection; to have an alternative to our data sets. We also like USGS, they collect data with no management recommendations, and we rely on them oftentimes for some of that core data in our management decisions and even enforcement compliance recommendations.
and maybe we can make this administratively or have to get legislation. We perhaps should be looking at passing on some of those costs through our permitting process. There’s a fee associated with the permits that goes into a fund to pay for data.
so, that is coming forward in potentially our administrative rules and recommendations, which our regulatory fees that we authority to do, so that way portions of those fees like if you're benefiting from the use of diverting water, you're also contributing into cost sharing. Understanding what the low flow is and what it takes to monitor and engage so that's one way to kind of offset the stop cost potentially in the future.
I also want to add that in a situation where there's a lawsuit or a settlement is achieved; say with Kamehameha schools in the Lalakea issue. It's a fixed amount and USGS gauges, while there is an upfront cost, there's also an operation and maintenance costs that we pay for every year. That's where we see the benefit of a particular gauge that was funded temporarily. It gets funded through a cooperative agreement with Kamehameha schools and then six years down the road the money dries up and then we don't have that data coming in. So, we add it to our cooperative agreement. I apologize for adding to the cost of our cooperative agreement, but I see the benefit of increased data collection, so we just keep adding stations.
Ayron and thank you for your work you and your crew are really at the heart of our ability to make quality decisions on the part of the commission.
they are wonderful. We appreciate them every day.
yeah, Ayron how do you cooperate with DAR and DOFAW and the Water Commission, three separate agencies that really have differing responsibilities and managing streams, especially on state-owned land. Is that just kind of informal cooperation or do you have something written that kind of spells that up?
We appreciate the help we receive from the DOFAW base yards.
They have assisted us on numerous occasions, whether it’s getting unstuck in the mud, delivering items, or signing off on deliveries. They have also been helpful in storing equipment for us. We cooperate with them on DLNR issues involving water, especially when jurisdictions overlap. DAR has a smaller footprint and focuses primarily on marine ecosystems. While they have jurisdiction over freshwater biota, their capacity for work is limited. Pooling our resources with DAR has been instrumental, particularly in conducting biota surveys. During the pandemic, DAR staff couldn’t travel, so our commission staff’s approval to assist with biota surveys on Maui was beneficial. Thorough habitat analysis and biota surveys require four or five staff, while DAR had only two available on the island. CWRM coordinating and providing access to locations has been helpful, especially on Maui.
yeah, and I'm not surprised I mean DOFAW has a good history. And one other quick question. Do you prioritize dissemination and acquisition of data on state-owned streams, manage streams, or privately owned? Is there any sort of significance?
we don't prioritize anything. Anywhere we have data need we try and figure out a way to collect the data. With the constraints that we have; a budget that is limiting.
I think you folks have prioritized IIFSs and the balancing of in-stream and off-stream needs based on a lot of those streams that were heavily diverted historically. We've prioritized those streams that have this tension or the need for balance of off-stream and in-stream. And there are other streams that are purely not being diverted. So, I think a lot of the focus is where there are in-stream and off-stream needs that need to be balanced. That's where the commission spent the majority of its time since 2012 when you guys started really ramping up IIFSs. So, I think we're almost there and there are a couple more areas that we're going to focus and shift to; Southeast Kaua‘i is one of them. But other than that, a lot of those historic plantation systems had diverted a lot of water out of watershed. Ayron and his team have really kind of just re-established more of a balanced approach to protect streams where they need in-stream values to be protected as well as balancing off stream needs in that process. So, there are some prioritizations in that context.
one more quick comment. Chair, I know as DLNR Chair you have many priorities everyone needs more resources, but investing in Ayron and his team right now is probably one of the best investments you could make at this time.
I appreciate that, Mike. I'm trying to figure out how I can save them time by having staff on the other Island. How can we empower DOFAW to be multitasked? I am really trying to break down silos within DLNR so that there's better cooperation where we can cross over. A lot of this is being done informally, but I think we have a really good opportunity this legislative session is going to provide us with a lot more needed tool. I've personally really appreciated Ayron's presentation. I knew how valuable they were, I didn't know how invaluable they really are to this department and the commission's ability to make informed decisions. We could not operate without them.
yeah, just a quick one Ayron. I noticed you flashed up and said the data was available.
we have an online data portal, it’s cwrm.aquaticinformatics.net. It is publicly available, it doesn't require login. The caveat is that there are some quirks to it that we haven't quite ironed out, including not all the stations that are real-time are reporting in real-time.
like the batteries are at out, the tTelemetry is out. It's just because USGS has their data, and they have their disclaimers. Even if just a link were available, I could see it being very valuable for the public.
So I'll go to Molokai - so this is the Kamoku intake station. Some of these statistics aren't really valid because we haven't been there in three months so it's like you have to take it with a grain of salt a little bit.
Ayron, with those communities that you've been helping to support collect data or Department of Ag or other agencies, they access this now currently for data, so we do more direct data sharing versus larger public dissemination. Because we can control the messaging and the limits of that data sharing, it is something that again hopefully with more staff, we will be able to get up to a point where it can be made available to the larger public in real-time.
are we doing data collection for climate change?
we've prioritized maintaining USGS gauging stations with really long records, particularly in locations with climate change impacts. This allows us to better understand changes in rainfall patterns, including increased or decreased rainfall, more intense storm events but fewer of them, and extended drought periods. Whether it's more rainfall, less rainfall, or more intense storm events, but fewer of them more drought periods. By preserving a continuous record, we can analyze trends over time. In the past few years, we have successfully re-established three or four USGS stations with discontinued long-term records from the 50s, 60s, or 70s. so that we can do a deep dive into what is happening now relative to what happened 100 years ago.
that helps us with predictions for the future, right?
well in addition, one of our focuses last month, we had PDKE come and present, but we also work very closely with Water Resource Research Center and really building up the Mesonet program, which is the establishment of these climate stations that'll collect a myriad of different data sets that will help to hopefully inform some climate predictions. I don't want to jump into the technicalities of it but that's how we've been really focusing our climate efforts is to support Dr. Giambelluca with the establishment once that's built out, we should have that's one of the focal points of the data collection.
well, that should hopefully help us too on drought.
drought, flooding, a better understanding of climate impacts.
Ayron, I join the other Commissioners and thank you for your work and long been impressed by both the volume of it as well as the value of it. So, you've got four staff what would be optimal?
obviously, if we were to maintain monitoring stations at the level which USGS maintains them; they assign about eight to ten stations per staff, so we have about 50 or 60 stations, just for data hydrological data collection. We would need five to six staff just for that, not including biota, not including what we need for meetings, or community engagement, just to maintain stations.
and that’s existing right?
existing not adding new ones.
so, let’s just say double what we have as a round number. So, is there any prospects for that possibility, Kaleo? Let me ask one last thing of Ayron. You've talked about the scope of the data, just highlight the substance. What's the most alarming thing you're finding? What's the most gratifying thing you're finding?
On the stream flow side, we faced extreme drought conditions in East Maui during 2020, 2021, and 2022. In some streams like Ho‘olawa nui and ‘O‘opuola, the measured low flows were even lower than the entire period of record for the USGS gauges, which have been in place for 50 to 60 years. This is a concerning situation. Despite the challenges, we were able to rapidly quantify these low flow conditions under the current climate conditions. We conducted a three-year study in about 18 months with the help of conversations with the USGS. Turning to the biota side, we observed a lack of expected recruitment in streams like Waiāhole on Windward O‘ahu, despite significant flow restoration efforts. One contributing factor seems to be vegetation management issues in the estuary. Large sections of the stream are clogged with hau bush, similar to the situation in Kahana where overgrowth of invasive vegetation has impacted the stream channel and native species recruitment. It’s disheartening to note that at the 400-foot elevation, we didn’t find a single ‘alamo‘o or an nōpili in a stream that should ideally support their presence due to significant base flow restoration. It’s worth mentioning that the watershed where these issues arise is not directly managed by DOFAW. While they manage for myconia and other factors, the overall dominance of non- native invasive vegetation in the watershed plays a role in the challenges we observe. We are still in the process of quantifying the impact of this vegetation, and that’s why we are gathering data-to better understand its role. In a recent survey of a higher elevation reach in Waikāne, we were amazed to find four different native species, including naniha, nākea, and nōpili. Waikāne doesn’t face the same estuary clogging issues as Waiāhole, but it does have water quality challenges due to the presence of junk cars and cesspools in the watershed. Despite these factors, witnessing the presence of native species at a higher elevation than expected was enlightening.
thank you so much Ayron to you and your team. Mahalo for all of your good work.
I have to say thank you to the Deputy and my supervisor Dean because they let me spend the money that I get to spend.
but hopefully, you'll get more we're working on it. But thank you so much for your presentation. We've got one more item, C2. What I'd like to suggest is rather than taking a lunch break let's just take a really quick bathroom break.
