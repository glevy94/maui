COMMISSIONER BUCK: Yeah.  
CHAIR CHANG: -- way in the back.  
(Laughter.)  
CHAIR CHANG: No, I -- undoubtedly, big shoes to fill. You bring a very different perspective than he does, but, you know, I think that is -- yeah, as you say, Wayne, that is the wonderful value. I mean, we were all here when we had man boards and water commissions that were very different composition that didn't necessarily reflect this kind of wealth of expertise and communities. So, yeah, we've come a long way.  
COMMISSIONER BUCK: Yeah. One other suggestion I forgot that because of Zoom, there should be at least -- like once every quarter that the commissioners could come together so you actually could be in the same room. Because it's so much easier to go on Zoom, we all know that, and we prefer that mostly, but especially (inaudible), it's really important for people to sit face to face.  
CHAIR CHANG: I think more people have been trying to make an effort, so yeah. But thank you for bringing -- creating the opportunity for everybody to be here today.  
COMMISSIONER BUCK: Yeah.  
(Laughter.)  
CHAIR CHANG: Don't do it again.  
(Laughter.)
