Now, that may be due far beyond just -- just this particular project, but I think -- how to -- sharing the opportunity of participation by our community members, including our developers, to help the state better manage our resources. And I'm -- I'm just kind of struggling.

But I think, Kaleo, as a matter of policy -- and I'm not going to just pick on Mr. Arakaki, but I think we need to kind of think about that, you know, as conditions. What -- what is it that we can ask the applicant that comes before us? And it might be contributing to a fund so that we can work with DAR on doing, you know, better -- better management. But I just think that the opportunity presents itself when we're going through an application on the known activities that could have an impact on -- on water quality, ecosystem, and -- I'm just -- you know, how do we as -- as citizens of this state collectively try to do -- to do better.

DEPUTY MANUEL: Maybe just -- I totally get it, and we've talked about these issues --

CHAIR CHANG: Yeah, yeah.
