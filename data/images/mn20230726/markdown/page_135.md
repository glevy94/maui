Then moving into the development of both the agency and public review draft, and obviously we'll end on the development and adoption of the final plan. Having throughout this process, having stakeholder consultations as well as four different community meetings.

As a quick note about the schedule, we did begin this process in early 2019, and with this year -- at the beginning of the year, we had released the agency review draft, recently integrated feedback from that, and will be soon releasing the public review draft, and are looking to hopefully have the plan adopted by the end of this year.

As mentioned, we've had stakeholder consultations throughout this process with both community organizations that work in the district on various activities related to watershed health, as well as county and state agencies, in addition to regular neighborhood board presentations to the district's three neighborhood boards, and in addition to the community meetings that were just mentioned.

So now I'll be moving into Chapter 2, which really sets the foundation for the plan as it provides a profile of the district's eight -- ten different watersheds. And as mentioned, as Barry mentioned, this plan takes a very comprehensive view of watershed health, so this chapter really digs into all the different historical, cultural, environmental factors that impact watershed health.
