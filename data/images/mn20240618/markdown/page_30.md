**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** I see, okay it's from DHHL. You answered that question for me, thank you.  

**ANDREW CHOY:** When we calculate our reservation requests to the Water Commission, it's really based off of our Island Plans. As you folks know, the Hawaiian Homes Commission has exclusive land use authority over Hawaiian Homelands. Our Island Plans articulate our Commission's land use policy for our land, so are we going to use it for residential, are we going to use it for ag, are we going to use it for commercial? Our water reservations are based in large part on our Island Plans. We've made reservations for portions of our lands, but not all of our lands so that's where that number came from.  

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** In calculating that number, it's interesting, it's kind of a gross number and were other sources considered in looking at that only 15% being available in terms of the public water systems that are available? Public utilities and that sort of thing which is where the majority of Hawaiian Homes beneficiaries get their water today? Or was that ignored and just saying, okay we need that reservation just as an estimate of the total quantity of water that DHHL beneficiaries will need going forward, do you know?  

**ANDREW CHOY:** If I understand your question correctly, I believe the Water Code says that our reservations are for both current and future needs of both. When we designate our lands for residential, it's normally based off of the usual county municipal standards of 600 gallons per lot per day, so we will designate say 10 acres for residential and we'll do a back of the order envelope calculation of how many lots at say 5,000 square feet or 75,000 square feet that we can get from that area and that's what we base our estimate.  

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** I understand, but I’m talking about where is it coming from. What’s the source? Did you assume that any of that would come from the public utility or county sources?  

**ANDREW CHOY:** I think in certain locations where the county system is within close proximity to our lands then the assumption is we will try to work with the municipality.  

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** Do you know for sure? Is that taken into account in the 15% or not?  

**ANDREW CHOY:** Do we know for sure if the county has…  

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** In other words, does the 15% assume that other public sources would be providing water to DHHL properties?  

**ANDREW CHOY:** When we calculate our reservations, it's based on what is needed for homesteading.
