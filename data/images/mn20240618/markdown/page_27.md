analogous to the Winters Doctrine in the US where Navajo have rights of prior appropriation. Do you have that background Katie?

**KATIE ROTH:** Maybe I would defer to Andrew and DHHL staff to come up and comment on that.

**ANDREW CHOY, DHHL:** Aloha Andrew Choy, representing the Department of Hawaiian Homelands, thank you for the question Commissioner Kagawa. The Department has a unique history. As you folks know it was established by Congress in 1921, adopted by the full Congress back then. It was administered by the Territory of Hawai‘i up until Statehood. Now when Hawai‘i was admitted to the US through the Admissions Act, one of the conditions of the Admissions Act was that the State would take on the responsibility of carrying out the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act as a condition of Statehood. That is one statutory authority. The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act was thus incorporated into State of Hawai‘i’s Constitution. Its water rights are articulated as part of the State's Constitution, it's also identified specifically in the Water Code as and also further validated by Supreme Court rulings as a public trust purpose use of water. I don't know if that answered your question, Commissioner?

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** I think it does because I think without understanding some of that legal context, I guess it gets uncomfortably misfocused and I think what we want to do is stay on what the Commission's responsibility to the statutes is. I wanted to get back to Katie's presentation and understand, so DHHL has this privilege in designated and non-designated areas, some of it is unexercised, much of it is paper water. What are the implications for the matters coming before us? I know we've had the Waimea Watershed matter which is going to be the next action item. There are these proposals for Maui and Moloka‘i, everyone's going to have their claim and DHHL being one of them, that need to be balanced a little bit differently than multiple permits. Am I understanding that correctly? Is that the way we should be thinking about it from your perspective?

**KATIE ROTH:** Can you just articulate the specific question you have?

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** Mostly I'm trying to mirror back that I'm understanding kind of what we need to take away from this presentation, that we need to understand that DHHL has this particular ability to make reservations in both designated and undesignated areas, and that we need to factor it in. But DHHL is not just another permit applicant, right? So, how do we as Commissioners need to be weighting things? I think that's some of what the other Commissioners have been trying to get at.

**KATIE ROTH:** I think you're absolutely correct. One of the major takeaways from this presentation, like you said, DHHL as one public trust use of water does have priority. How we figure out a way to balance that with other both public trust uses of water and
