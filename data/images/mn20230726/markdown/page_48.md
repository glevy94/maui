I would like to speak to you today about water quality and efforts the Navy continues to ensure our water quality for our distribution system and to protect, monitor, and make sure that we're doing everything we can to ensure we have safe drinking water.

Currently, we are in Period 6 of a seven-period commitment that the Navy made in March of 2022 to collect 7800 drinking water samples from the distribution system for the purpose of identifying clean water in locations, ensuring that the recovery we had done following the water crisis in November of 2021 had sustained and that we had no ongoing issues in the water system. This effort also aims to build public confidence in the drinking water system by creating an avenue for consistently collecting data, posting it publicly, and interacting with residents in the community to demonstrate that the drinking water is safe.

So far, we have collected 6300 samples of drinking water from residents and facilities throughout the distribution system. We also have several locations where we continue to collect samples on a periodic basis, such as all of our schools, child development facilities, medical facilities, and any other high-risk locations. We do this with the purpose of ensuring that we are showing that the water is safe.
