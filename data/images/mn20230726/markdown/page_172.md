Amendment or modification does not require additional commission funding. Request that Hawaiâ€˜i Department of Water Supply comply with any stream diversion operational needs USGS deems necessary to conduct a successful seepage run. Declare that the project is exempt from EA requirements under HRS Chapter 343 and HAR Chapter 11-200.1.

Are there any questions?

COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: Not a question, but it's fascinating, East Maui when you talked about the different characteristics of the geology. So between Hamakua and Hawi, what are the different characteristics?

DR. STRAUCH: So there are perched water bodies. The Hawi volcanics tend to be thin and perched, providing some level of perched water bodies which contributes to lots of spring flow. The Y -- that particular area of the stream in the Hawi volcanics is losing -- is not yet determined.

COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: That's what --

DR. STRAUCH: But one of the reasons why we're doing the seepage run, again, most of these volcanics are tend to be pretty porous, so -- but that -- there is a high elevation region where the Kohala volcanic, you know, chill building phase and the Mauna Kea chill building phase overlapped, so there's somewhat unique geology, especially in that Waimea Town region, that has higher elevation.
