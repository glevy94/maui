Briefing on Site Visit to Lahaina Aquifer Sector, Water Resources and Systems of Kaua‘ula, Maui held on October 18, 2023 at request of Chairperson Dawn Chang, with Commission Staff, and Community Stakeholders
Staff stated the purpose of visiting Kauaʻula Valley and shared data, requests of stakeholders, and photos of site visit.
I do want to thank all the ʻohana, the hospitalities that they showed us when we did the site visit, so thank you very much.
Thank you Ayron for the pictures as well, very interesting. Overall, what kind of condition do you think the pipes, the channels, the systems it’s in at this point and is there a substantial amount of deferred maintenance to leaks and unintended spills?
I don’t think that’s the case. I think most of the ditch is concrete and the few pukas that are in place have been sealed over the years. The siphon is old but it's holding up. I'm not sure on long-term maintenance plan, but the forebay over the years or the penstock to Kauaʻula Hydropower Plant over the years has taken damage and been repaired over and over again. So, there's probably more work that could be done, but it's in pretty good shape overall.
Continuing on the line of questioning about the condition of the system, we had a decision of the Commission that in lieu of a fine of nearly half a million dollars, the landowner was to make an investment, commence an investment in the rehabilitation largely of the reservoir systems there. Is there evidence that that work has been completed?
I believe that's in Olowalu.
Different system.
On the subject since we have that before us.
They are working on certain improvements with the community that have been made, yes. I didn't have the exact status of their rehabilitation off top my head.
The reservoirs of that are the subject of that decision are Olowalu and?
Olowalu. They’re not associated with LIC.
The lower Olowalu Reservoir and the Snake Reservoir, I hope.
Thanks, Ayron for giving us the sort of slideshow view. I was just wondering as Commissioners, except for Chair Chang, we haven't had the privilege of seeing the whole system and so can you give us an impression of your current view on the whole system and where as Commissioners we should really be paying attention to? I think we have abundant testimony that's going to help us focus on Mokuhinia, but it all flows from up there. You can give us your opinion on, I mean there are certain sites you visited for certain reasons. Are there sort of broad take homes from that field trip?
The sites were chosen because they represent key points in the system in terms of water decision-making; how much water can be removed from the stream, how much water might get allocated to one user or another user, how much water gets returned to the stream, what alternatives exist, groundwater or surface water, and what are the consequences of utilizing those groundwater sources in terms of potential downstream hydrological effects. So, higher level on the instream flow standard we will discuss in another PowerPoint and then the groundwater consequences, it's going to depend on other analyses like water use permits and that sort of thing that I'm not prepared to talk about right now.
Okay, I have a follow up question. Just looking from the old map, it looks like Mokuhinia is completely spring fed and so we need to think about surface-groundwater connections. Do we have an ability to understand the status of the groundwater in this area? Wells other than spring flow or lack of?
We're working on monitoring. We are getting pump rates at least on a daily basis and we're working with our groundwater team to assess the consequences of groundwater withdrawals on spring flows.
Are there any shallow wells where you can monitor chlorides?
Yeah, the shafts are.
But is there data coming from them?
Off the top of my head, I'm not sure. I’m not the groundwater team.
Okay, sorry. I’m just trying to understand what information we need to better understand this complex system. You know, there's been a lot of calls for recycling. Are there opportunities or would that even make sense for Kauaʻula?
That's also in another presentation.
Okay commissioner, you're kind of jumping the gun here. 
The next section, okay.
That's on Item B-2. We sort of took this out of order so we could kind of lay the site visit, but the staff intends to get into greater detail on an update which will include them.
Ayron, you mentioned the hiring load. What capacity is that hydro? Is it active?
It is not currently active. It was active up until 2018. What's the max capacity of the penstock? Is that the question?
Well, that leads to the question that you mentioned that the flow out of the penstock was used to pressurize water to feed existing users.
The pen stock is pressurized by the...
But the water exiting the forebay that is what's driving the head to deliver water?
Yeah, but because of the variable inflows from the stream... 
I assume it’s a run of the river hydro?
Yes, that variable inflow changes the pressure felt at the nozzle and therefore the amount of water. They don't want to blow the pipes and they want to have sufficient pressure to get water uphill. The operator has to constantly adjust the valve because the system was never designed to deliver water uphill. We can get into the details later.
I guess the question is who's managing it and what are they managing?
LIC (Launiupoko Irrigation Company).
Just the water pressure if you drive the head? 
Wai should not be owned, restore mauka to makai flow. Their water is used to fight fire because of where they are located

I will tell you that for the Water Commission, I think we realized there's more that we don't know. I mean I think Red Hill has been a real good example of that we don't know what's happening underneath, so you know we're really looking at how we need better data, we need better monitoring, and we need better gauges monitoring. Your point is well taken and we are well aware of that and recognize that water is integrated whether it's ground or surface. Thank you again for that reminder, Hōkūao.
