And then the last graph, again, I think this is -- this one's a little bit confusing because you'll see my time series goes from 12.5 to 17. So if I had -- if it went all the way down to zero, I think you'd have a better idea of how much they were over-pumping Waiawa Shaft. And I'm not making excuses for the Navy, by any means, but Waiawa Shaft was -- is the only source that's online to supply their entire water system. So you can see how much in excess they did pump. We did -- we are keeping tabs on their -- both their pumpage and the chlorides of Waiawa Shaft on a more -- a finer scale.

So let's talk about the change in pumpage as -- in response to the release. Red Hill Shaft stopped in December 2021 and resumed on January 29, 2022, for plume containment, and they've been pumping an average of about 4.2 mgd.

Pumpage ceased at Aiea-Halawa Shaft at the same time. Pump started up again in September of 2022, and I think they just run the pumps periodically just for a couple of days a month, and they only pump about a hundred thousand gallons a month.

And then -- oh, I'm sorry. And then Waiawa Shaft has always -- again, that's the one that they exceeded their allocation for, and we've discovered -- or they've discovered leaks in the system that can be -- can speak to why they were over pumping. And at a certain point, they pumped 16.993 million gallons per day, but they -- again, they're reducing.
