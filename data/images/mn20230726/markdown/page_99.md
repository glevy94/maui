But most of the information that I'm gonna be talking about, again, is in the final report, and there's also a fact sheet that's available. All of these are available online at these sites, or if you just Google USGS Publications Warehouse and Volcanic Aquifers of Hawaiʻi, you'll get it.

Okay. So how to answer the question of how much groundwater is available in -- from Hawaiʻi's aquifers? Well, all groundwater withdrawals have consequences. In Hawaiʻi, I am sure many of you are familiar with this, but those consequences are water-table decline, saltwater rise and encroachment -- I guess you should see it down here -- and reduction of groundwater discharge to springs, streams, wetlands, and the ocean.

Groundwater availability depends on the severity of the consequences the community is willing to accept, so groundwater availability depends on what you're able to accept in consequences. And we know that those consequences -- you know, it's a complicated question and, you know, involves human and environmental health considerations, economics, legal rights, and statutes, and so forth, which are kind of beyond the science part, but --

Okay. The consequences also differ by hydrogeologic setting. Now, in the report, we group the groundwater occurrences in Hawaiʻi to four principal hydrogeologic settings. Again, these are probably very familiar to you, but
