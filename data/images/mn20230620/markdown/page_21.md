council and our water board that will -- it will beef up our water conservation requirements.

And a big one is our tiered structure. As the other islands do, we have a tiered structure, and council has just approved a revision to our tier structure where we increase the upper tier a lot. And so basically, you know, the -- the lifeline water rate didn't change much, but the top tier, we increased 24 percent. So that's -- that was found to be maybe one of the most important things you can do. You know, money talks, right? So to -- you know, to -- to encourage people to -- to reduce water use, especially those that are using a lot.

We also implemented -- council will be -- has approved a new rate for hotels and resorts that's a higher rate so that they pay more for the water.

And we do have some gray water initiatives going as well. We've got one going in one of our parks and getting ready to put in another one. So we see those as templates to help, you know, increase gray water use throughout the county.

We also have some strategies that deal with climate change. We're supporting the collaborative hydrological efforts studies of impacts of climate change and future well development on groundwater health. And we have an ongoing study with USGS to -- to assess the effects of scenario-based recharge change on groundwater in the Maui aquifers as demand.
