like Susan said, revise, repurpose, recycle, whatever; I don't think that's a valid reason. 

**COMMISSIONER HO:** Can I respond? So it is a -- in all things, and in a lot of things when we're dealing with solid waste, those are the three Rs, reduce, reuse, and recycle, and so we -- it's not a requirement, it -- in this context.

**MS. GORMAN-CHANG:** So you're choosing to do it.

**COMMISSIONER HO:** In this context, it's not a requirement. It is would you please look at this and determine whether, one, you can reuse it? For example, some people have said, Why don't we get the University of Hawaiâ€˜i to do a research center there, or why don't you make it into a museum? Those are reuses of that facility. It is -- it may not be, but that's what people are -- some people are saying. So it's not that we're gonna -- that it's gonna happen, it's just will you take a look at these three criteria and see if you could reuse it and recycle it? Meaning could be taking out the pipelines and using the pipes or the electrical system and reuse it in some other way. It's just these are three -- three words that we want that -- we want the Navy and the public to think about. Is there a way that you can reuse or reduce or recycle this facility to make it a better facility or to make it into something different? It's not a requirement; it is a goal of ours.
