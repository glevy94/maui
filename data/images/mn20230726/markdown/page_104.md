and a little bit more here because -- but not as much in the Wai‘anae area because withdrawals are not as much as they are in the Ko‘olau side. The freshwater lens, despite having quite a bit of withdrawal in 2001 to 2010, can see that the water table hasn't declined quite as much as it has in the dike-impounded area, but that's because of the high permeability of the freshwater lens setting.

But in the freshwater lens setting, the saltwater-freshwater boundary rose considerably under this 2001 to 2010 condition. So it shows that for the freshwater lenses, saltwater rise is one -- gonna be one of the principal factors that limit groundwater availability. You know, there is a little bit also going on in the dike-impounded areas, but not as much as you see in the freshwater lens.

This map shows the effect of the withdrawals on streamflow, and now, again, we see that most of the impact is happening in the streams in the dike-impounded groundwater areas. In the freshwater lens areas, it -- there is an impact right at the -- where the cap rock meets the aquifer, and there are -- there is groundwater discharge to -- to springs in the -- in the freshwater lens. This is the Pearl Harbor Springs.

Another simulation was to look at the combination of withdrawal and recharge, so we looked at -- we simulated recharge in 1870, this was before the first modern well was.
