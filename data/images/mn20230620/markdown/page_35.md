navigation pane in PDF, so a senior version, because it allows you to navigate from page 1300 back to the TOC back to -- you know, and jump around sections. So I think that would ease access and review and feedback and maybe ameliorate any kind of frustrations. So, thank you.

CHAIR CHANG: No, thank you. That was very helpful.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Chair, quickly.

CHAIR CHANG: Go ahead.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Eva, what's the status of the Molokai and Lanai Water Use Development Plans?

MS. BLUMENSTEIN: Mahalo, Commissioner. We have the consultant, Townscape, halfway through, a little more than halfway through, updating the Molokai Water Use and Development Plan. A lot of the community engagement is completed, demand projections are done, and we're now vetting resource options or presenting resource options to the community. So they have still a ways to go.

We put in -- we had funding approved for this next fiscal year, FY '24, to commission a consultant to help us update the Lanai Water Use and Development Plan. So, you know, it's a multi-year process, but thinking, you know, we'll contract towards the end of this year to begin that process.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: So what -- where do you view the horizon for these plans that you'll have something that -- to present?
