You're getting a teaspoon out a month. And then that draw then has to be -- exit the system, so it goes into Wahiawa Stream after you've taken the teaspoonful out and you're monitoring that there's no more in there that's causing damage to the -- the riparian?

CAPTAIN SULLIVAN: So the -- within the capture zone within the Red Hill Shaft, we are pulling and skimming from the surface of the water. The pump is pulling from 18 foot below the surface of the water to where we are testing the water quality there. We are running it through granular activated carbon treatment to strip out any TPH-related components that could exist, and then we are again testing the water at the effluent side of those GAC treatments before it is going into the Wahiawa Stream. So it's being tested prior to as well as at the exterior, and we are not pulling from the surface; we are pulling from 18 foot below.

COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: And those tests are indicating no problem?

CAPTAIN SULLIVAN: Correct. Those -- yeah, there is not -- there is no TPH that is being released into the environment at all.

COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: Okay, thank you.

CHAIR CHANG: Okay. Any other questions?  
(No response.)  
CHAIR CHANG: Go ahead.
