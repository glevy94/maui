CAPTAIN SULLIVAN: Yeah, pending any questions, I know that there's a lot of detail to give. This is why we will always keep this updated on our website, and this is the tool that we're gonna utilize any time that I'm briefing, whether -- it doesn't matter what the forum is, this is -- this is what we will utilize to make sure that that whole transparency is out there and we continue to move forward in it.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Excuse me, Chair. This is Wayne Katayama.

CHAIR CHANG: Yes.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: May I ask a question?

CHAIR CHANG: Yes, Wayne.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Captain Sullivan, maybe you could help me with the eight remaining monitoring wells. What is your ETA on putting those online?

CAPTAIN SULLIVAN: Our goal for all of those eight remaining is to get them complete by the end of the calendar year, but we have run into substantial issues with some of the private landowners that are in the area that are -- that are not interested in us drilling a well within their area. So we continue -- again, Board of Water Supply has been very helpful in helping us to maybe encourage or to work through some of the permitting requirements. Obviously, we have to follow all.
