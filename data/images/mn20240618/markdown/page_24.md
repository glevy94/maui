but they have lands in Wai‘ehu that could potentially utilize non-potable water. So, we might need to modify the North Wai‘ehu IIFS to accommodate those uses.  

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** But I'm talking about cases where usually when we set an IIFS, it's been my experience that we basically set it at the minimum that allows viable stream life, not way above it. In a case where the IIFS is at a level that any lowering of it all would harm the stream, are you saying that from your standpoint we have to do that?  

**DR. STRAUCH:** I'm not making a blanket statement across all IIFS and in actuality I don't think most IIFS have been minimum, they've been above the minimum.  

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** So what would happen then if you have a DHHL reservation request which is reasonable, but it takes off more from the stream than what would be the minimal viability?  

**DR. STRAUCH:** That would be a balancing that the Commission would need to make. The stream is not more important as compared to DHHL, it's equally important as DHHL.  

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** Okay, so what is the compromise? The reason I ask is that there have been some dicta by the Supreme Court that said there may be instances where you have to destroy the resource to accommodate uses, never went beyond that to say how do you decide that. Okay, but in this case there will come a time because DHHL is finally getting enough lands to be used, especially in rural areas where they don't have access to a public water supply system, they have to put in their own. There's going to be a time that we have to decide, but from my standpoint, if you take a stream below viability, that's destroying the stream. It seems to me from my standpoint you can draw enough water for off-stream uses, including DHHL where it does not affect the stream viability. Now the obvious answer is that other users get their water taken away for DHHL because DHHL is a public trust purpose. I think that also when in the current Water Management Areas, if you have unused or unpermitted excess in a particular aquifer or in a stream area and DHHL gets a reservation, that amount of water gets taken off about what is available for other permits, right? That’s what happens?  

**DR. STRAUCH:** If you may allow me to comment, the history behind stream diversions and IIFS has been that the construction of the dam essentially took all but the high flows. I would assume, and we would probably make the recommendation that, to meet, say a DHHL need or any other need, we should not be so destructive to the stream as to completely drain it or completely remove all but the high flows, such that even if we lowered an IIFS to say the 64% of medium base flow, which has kind of been accepted as that minimum that you're talking about, there is still opportunity to provide for the flushing of larvae or nutrients or sediment or coarse woody debris to provide for the habitat, to keep the riffles and runs flowing, so that we have migratory pathways.
