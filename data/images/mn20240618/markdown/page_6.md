COMMISSIONER HO: I have a question about the delegation. I understand that the proposal is to delegate to the Chair, I understand that. My question is, is this ministerial versus rulemaking? So it's a legal question. The other question I have, along the lines of what Aurora was mentioning which is, is there a certain criteria that is part of the recommendation for the Chair to make that determination as to what comes to the Commission? For the Department of Health, we have a statute that says if it is in the public interest to bring something to require a public hearing, the director may require a public hearing on a permit issue and in the statute itself it sets forth some criteria. It's a legal issue, I think, but I'm wondering how we would address that?

CHAIR CHANG: Good question.

RYAN IMATA: No, go ahead. I'm not the attorney here.

COMMISSIONER HO: In this case, I'm not either.

CHAIR CHANG: And I'm not rendering a legal opinion either, but quite frankly that's why I brought this to the Commission in December 2023 because I just felt that in light of the comments that we were receiving- and this came up in Hāpuna about traditional and customary practices, 343, that there seemed to be a question as to, shouldn't this be a matter that's really brought before the Water Commission? Not just delegated to the Chairperson. I think staff has tried to attempt to craft exceptions. I don't know if I would necessarily say it's ministerial because there are discretionary provisions that may be triggered. I think Aurora's comment is a really good one that there should be maybe a 1C that says something recognizing that where there are Commission decisions or determinations, that does not waive the Commission's right to oversee this. So something to that effect because I too, I felt really uncomfortable with this sort of unlimited delegation and that was more because I wasn't as familiar. I also thought that there are some things that should be brought out to the larger public. I think Ryan is talking also about the Ka Pa‘akai Analysis, having greater guidance that can provide staff the opportunity. Also the public website - creating an opportunity where everybody can see all applications. Now whether that at least provides another opportunity for the public to know what permits the Commission may be looking at or the staff may be looking at. Balancing that against looking at all of the testimony that came primarily from the water departments, recognizing we've got to find a balance between how do we facilitate some of these smaller requests versus how do we differentiate those that do require greater review in a public forum by the Water Commission.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: I was just going to ask, historically, how have we handled all of these delegations? Has it been rulemaking or has it been ministerial?
