Are projects -- I mean, how is the Board of Water Supply kind of addressing the dependence of the district, you know, on other water management areas that can't reap the benefits of these particular projects? Like, is there a way -- because it's probably -- the income, you know, disparity of East Honolulu versus ‘Ewa, you know, we don't -- is there consideration of that kind of transboundary reliance and ability to build in sort of reciprocity in that to support -- to recognize the reliance of East Honolulu on conservation activities, say, in Honolulu or Ko‘olau Poko to maintain their subsidized water supply?

MR. USAGAWA: You know, it would have been -- it would have been easy to just say we'll just get more water from Windward, but it's not there. So they have to pull their load, you know, conserve kuleana, that one slide, they need to be more efficient. We didn't -- what we -- we also have two well projects in the Wai‘alae West and Wai‘alae East Aquifers too to supplement. So it's not only reliant on -- on transfers and conservation. There are two small well projects that we -- we have on the books.

But, yeah, the -- in the Ko‘olau Poko and Ko‘olau Loa Watershed Plans, there's a policy in those plans about the transfer of water out of these districts shall not be detrimental to these districts. That's the only way we could get the plans adopted and endorsed by the neighborhood boards.
