PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Deputy Director Dean Uyeno
Staff stated the summary request which is to approve the modification of SCAP.6026.3 with revised recommendations from SHPD.
I did ask CWRM to ask SHPD (State Historic Presevation Division) to be available because the modification is primarily due to a changed position from SHPD.
Madam chairman, board members it’s great to be here, see your faces again. My name’s Merania Kekaula and I’m from the Mermaids. It’s just a swimming group, we do it for our health, we do ancient Polynesian and so it’s very important at Kokololio Beach. It’s important to us to make sure our environment is kept pristine, and we have a legacy to leave our children, grandchildren. It’s with a lot of concern that I’m here in a good way. I mean it’s not a lot of concern but there are just issues that have cropped up because of the bridge. Is that the bridge we’re at now we’re doing?
This is for the Hauʻula and Maʻakua Stream bridges.
Right and there are like about seven or eight bridges that will be reconstructed, yes. We’re wondering why the original SCAP, stream channel alteration permit was then changed and modified whereas why couldn’t that have been done in the planning stage in the original SCAP? What we’ve seen is a lot of adverse reaction, things that have happened as a result of this modification. The first, I’ll just go into them briefly, is the unearthing of the area right next to the stream where those two homes were, I take it those were the two homes that were removed.
Are you on this particular agenda?
That would be a question for DOT.
Okay, so what there is then there’s this huge dirt area and right next to the stream and we’re just praying that it doesn’t rain so hard. I mean we want the rain, but we’re concerned that it may just fall into the stream if flooding occurs. That’s one issue, the other issue that is of concern to us is the wildlife and the area of the environment that it cuts across, this spot of land is home to our turtles and our monk seal. Hauʻula is famous for because they always have this monk seal coming down and the areas are built up enough as it is, so we want as little disturbance for the sea creatures as possible. We’re concerned about the amount of chemicals, and I know you have programs to stop the chemicals from seeping into the ground around the area as well as the stream. I looked at the sausage bags you have and things to alleviate turbidity and things like that but we’re thinking of pathogens, we’re thinking of chemicals that you can’t see that get into the water and that are carried out to the ocean and into the environment. That coast along Hauʻula, it’s an area because Hauʻula/Kahuku that is on top of an aquifer. It has little pockets deep in the ocean and freshwater bubbles out and it’s cold. There’s a lot of good stuff there that we don’t want to see harmed.
This is for the stream channel alteration permit for the scaffolding, right? On Hauʻula Bridge?
They’ve already taken down the original bridge, haven’t they?
That’d be a question for DOT. Again, this is just for the scaffolding.
They’re moving the scaffolding from the mauka side for the pedestrian bridges and then they’re going to move it. Is this the same project?
This is the same project, but we’re just concerned about the big vehicles and how they say if there’s any seepage it’ll be taken like 100 yards down the road and away from the site. Well 100 yards down the road is still the area affected, the environment. We’re very concerned about that as I said. I did want to say also that I don’t know how many times we cross that bridge during the day, my husband does a lot he works out that way, but the makeshift bridge is very narrow, and we’re concerned as to how long the actual project of this bridge, just this bridge will take. Now it says sometime during April or May this year? No, was that next year it’s going to be completed? We were concerned is it just that bridge or is it the entire bridges that will be finished by it says 2025 May?
Ms. Kekaula, we have DOT here and they’re the project proponent so I’m going to ask because we’re not proposing the project, we’re actually just granting the permit. I’m going to ask you to summarize. I’ll then have DOT come up to respond to some of your questions.
Great. We’re concerned about that area and the strips that run along on either side of the bridge. It’s causing havoc because they’re ill-placed and they cause damage to the underneath of your car as well as wear and tear on the tires. That’s why we’re concerned as to when that particular project will be finished and if they can pull them up.
I just wanted to get some clarification on the project in question because we have not started construction and our project is a resurfacing project and so the pedestrian bridge improvements are just for two of the bridges within our limits. With regard to concerns about damage to the environment, we are implementing best management practices and incorporating it into our plans and specifications to mitigate that.
I understand it the Water Commission had previously approved this request. It’s now coming back, it’s a modification that you are moving the pedestrian bridge from the mauka side to the makai side. Temporary, is yours the repaving or is yours the construction?
It’s a resurfacing project that part of the scope also includes replacing the pedestrian bridges.
DOT has looked at this recommendation of staff including the incorporations of the need to have community meetings in alignment with DHHL’s concerns as well as best management practices with DOFAW’s concerns. You’re okay with the recommendation?
SHPD reviewed the project. We raised concerns about the presence of cultural resources and potentially burials within what their calling the area of potential effects, primarily on the makai side. We consulted with HDOT and Federal Highways regarding our concerns and the different agencies agreed, one that they would put interim protection measures where there are known sites to try and make sure that those areas are not impacted and that there would be some architectural documentation of the bridge before there was some modifications and that there would also be archaeological monitoring to ensure that if anything was impacted or identified during the actual construction that it could be documented and mitigation could occur. That was our letter, I believe it was in July of 2022.
Your original determination was no historic properties affected, but the modification does acknowledge that there. Is that based upon you did some additional consultation or?
We did additional due diligence on our end and then again, we consulted further with HDOT and Federal Highways.
When we approved the permit the first time, we recommended DHHL’s note that DOT should reach out to neighborhood board. Has that already been done or is there a planned date at which this will be presented just to make people aware of the project and that the precaution is being taken.
that has not occurred, yet. CHAIR CHANG: Are you going to do that?
If there’s a date, that would be great and I just say this especially with SHPD doing this kind of due diligence, it would sort of show that DOT is aware and has anticipated and prepared to have monitors on site. I think that could allay some of the community concerns that may come up as they see construction activities in the area.
My recollection, I believe Cy Bridges lives across the street. I think Cy Bridges lives mauka and they have found burials on that site, so I appreciate the due diligence. I thought I had raised a concern when we first had this matter, so I appreciate the fact that SHPD went back and did some additional discussions with DOT and that DOT has revised its plan.
