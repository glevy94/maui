The opportunity to assume a role in assuring the stewardship and availability of a life-enabling resource is a profound honor. I am grateful to Governor Ige for nominating me and to our State Senators for confirming my appointment. Thanks, as well, to Chairs Case and Chang, for guiding our work and to my fellow Commissioners who have been patient with my questions, respectful of my worldview and considerate of my positions. We have had a lot to do and owing to yeomen’s efforts of our dedicated staff, we have had full agendas. I observed this tone being set at the top when I visited Deputy Director Manuel one day. Kaleo had a white board on his wall that counted down the number of meetings that would occur under his watch because he believed that each meeting represented an opportunity to address the myriad issues before us. I took inspiration from his mission-driven mindset, and I am proud of what we have accomplished by working together with a sense of urgency.

Our business has covered a wide range of issues and I found it beneficial to be collaborating with colleagues who bring diverse skills and experiences to each topic.
- Impacts of climate change on rainfall, water recharge and sustainable yield.
- Domestic requirements, well development, conservation and drought planning.
- Pollution risks and the Red Hill crisis.
- Wastewater treatment and dual system benefits.
- Water Management Area designation.
- Stream and marine biology, watersheds, biodiversity.
- Cultural practices, kuleana rights and Ka Paʻakai analysis.
- Sustainable food system goals, transmission efficiencies and reservoir storage.
- Instream flow standards and riparian ecosystem services.
- Permit streamlining and enforcement challenges.
- Sunshine requirements, civic engagement and integration of stakeholder views.

Some of the achievements that I found particularly gratifying include:
- Resolving contested case disputes in East Maui, Nā Wai ʻEhā and Waimea, Kauaʻi that set instream flow standards and provided resources for off-stream use.
- Gaining the Navy’s acceptance of responsibility for draining and repurposing Red Hill fuel tanks and remediating our ground water resources.
- Designating Maui Komohana as a Water Management Area.
- Returning water to Molokaʻi’s Kawela Stream.
- Creating protocols that intensify our commitment to Ka Paʻakai analysis.

In my humble opinion, our efforts to accomplish these and other successful outcomes were benefited by four factors.
- A community that rises to the duty of civic engagement in a democratic system and shows up with knowledge of the topic, respect for the process and aloha ʻāina motivating their resolve.
