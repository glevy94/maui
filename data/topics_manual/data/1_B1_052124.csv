Approval of Stream Channel Alteration Permit (SCAP.6158.3) Application and Special Conditions, City and County of Honolulu, Board of Water Supply, Mākaha Wells II, III, and IV Access Road Repairs, Mākaha Stream, Mākaha, Oʻahu, Tax Map Key(s): (1) 8-4-030:004
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Deputy Dean Uyeno
Staff stated the summary of request to approve Stream Channel Alteration Permit (SCAP.6158.3) by the City and County of Honolulu, Board of Water Supply (BWS). The project proposes the replacement of six (6) existing culverts with a panel truss bridge and remove rock and debris that are blocking the Mākaha Stream.
My name is David Bills, I’m a civil engineer working in Honolulu for 40 years. I’ve done many Board of Water Supply projects and I put together the application for the stream channel alteration permit, as well as the Army Corps permit, and as well as coordinated the historic preservation aspects of the project. I don’t have anything particular to add uh except for maybe one statement. Mākaha Stream is a relatively big stream and Board of Water Supply quite often, maybe under-sizes their culverts at locations that are critical. I proposed to the Board, rather than having a culvert that would spill over and basically destroy the downstream area, that we look at a panel thrust bridge. It’s really nothing more than an old World War II bridge, but to make sure that we had three foot of freeboard from the bottom of the bridge uh to the water surface of the peak storm to make sure that that access road was available 24/7.
Thank you, Mr. Bills. I’m actually very familiar with this particular location, having driven over it many times. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit to the AIS (Archaeological Inventory Survey) and specifically the construction staging area that would be needed to carry out the work?
Yes, well if you’re familiar with the area, you have two gates you go through down at the bottom and then basically you’re driving up an AC-paved road uh until you come up to the culvert crossing. There happens to be some area off to the left that would be available for staging, provided the appropriate archaeological uh inventory survey was done to provide clearance. If that site was not available to use as a staging area, then the contractor would have to stage at the very bottom of the road at the two gates and drive the two and a half to three miles up to the uh bridge site uh to perform their work properly. We know that that’s an issue, but we went to SHPD (State Historic Preservation Division) pretty early and asked them if this was a possibility uh and they’re still, as far as I understand, in the process of providing a clearance or making a determination at this point.
That’s good to know that there are options, less desirable, but there are options.
Glad you added the less desirable.
Okay, thank you for sharing that.
I’ll be honest, I didn’t even realize there were springs, there were streams up in Mākaha. I apologize for my ignorance on that.
Are there other folks online?
I think they were all with BWS. Did anybody else from BWS want to speak? They delegated everything to the consultant. I’ll just ask, have you spoken to community people about this? Are there any impacts of this activity on downstream activities by community members?
There has been, as far as the consultant side goes and me as a civil engineer, uh I have not particularly talked to people except for passers-by and things of that nature. Through the archaeological process, I don’t think there’s a cultural impact study being done, but I do not know the full requirements of at least the AIS portion of the documents they’re doing in addition to the SHPD 6E.
I know, Dean, BWS is submitting or there’s an application for uh Water Management Area right?
Pending.
Is this all consistent with that plan that they’ve submitted to date or is it totally [inaudible]?
Yeah, it should.
In reviewing the submittal and then taking a closer look at the permit application specifically referencing that construction staging area, and I think as to date the consultant hasn’t contacted community, but the Board of Water Supply should. That is included in the recommendation on 1A and I want to endorse that just because Mākaha Valley is really significant archaeologically. Kāneʻaki Heiau is right at sort of the bottom of upper Mākaha and there’s a lot of intact agricultural terracing in the valley. I think it’s really important that this be done right and that’s on the Board of Water Supply who already works with I think Mōhala i Ka Wai, but maybe other groups. I would really strongly encourage some dialogue there with 1A. In addition, I wanted to propose a modification to 1D. It says, "actions in the streambed are subject to SHPD concurrence." I know that we are focused on water, but the construction of the stream channel alteration is going to impact a nearby agricultural terracing area. If you look at page 108 of the permit application, there is a map that shows the features that would be impacted and not being an archaeologist, I don’t know how these things work. Is it normally you just document before it gets disturbed? I think there’s an opportunity if it is going to be impacted to do some work with partners to restore it post-construction or avoid impact. Again, I know that’s not in the stream channel, but it is related to the stream channel work and I would want to be just very cognizant because of the agricultural significance of the valley to that whole region. I mean Mākaha used to be perennial, it’s fed by Kaʻala, so just to show that the Board is engaging in best practices. I had here, consider alternative staging areas, Mr. Bills said that that’s a possibility and I think engaging the community or community groups in the process of monitoring of activities and restoration as needed. The modification I just wanted to add was, it says, "actions in the streambed are subject to SHPD concurrence." I just wanted to add, "actions in the streambed and necessary construction staging area are subject to SHPD concurrence."
This is David Bills once again. I would just like to add a little comment there. With my experience with many consultants working with me for archaeological reasons, typically State Historic Preservation Division will, so more or less, take two types of actions. 1) They will allow uh recordation of the information that was there for historical purposes. 2) If it happens to be significant enough, they will want it to not be touched or marked out and left there, notifying the community and particularly community groups interested uh in archaeological and cultural things. I would tend to agree with you that the Board of Water Supply already has a route there and might as well take advantage of it.
I appreciate, Aurora, your comment. Sometimes we find that the staging area, pre-construction, can be even more invasive than the actual activity. I’m not sure the scope of SHPD’s review because if there’s going to be any subsurface excavation or if there’s going to be, usually they’ll have a buffer zone around known historic properties, so if there are terraces or other historic properties that should have been included in SHPD’s review. I think your proposed amendment is very appropriate. I would support the amendment. Mr. Bills, do you have any issues with that? Board of Water Supply?
I personally don’t have any, but uh I would like Board of Water Supply to also concur.
Hi, good morning, Michael Domion, Board of Water Supply. We concur with the amendments and we will go ahead and contact uh the possibly affected community uh and inform them of our project.
Thank you. The leeward coast, in particular Mākaha, there are known lineal and cultural descendants from the area who may know of the...and Board of Water Supply, you have really been at the forefront of valuing community, so I would think someone like Ernie would take very seriously the whole issue of reaching out to the community, so thank you.
Can you read the amendment? I’m a little confused about what we’re now going to be approving. Are we going to be approving with additional conditions and if so I want to know what the condition. You said with amendments, I want to know what the amendment...
Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani I believe made the addition to uh condition 1D which is, "actions in the streambed and necessary construction staging area are subject to SHPD concurrence if SHPD requires conditions delegate to deputy director to attach those as conditions."
The modification was the addition of the construction staging area.
But what exactly about the staging construction area are we uh requiring?
I think it’s subject to SHPD review to determine whether the staging area may have any impact on known historic properties. If there’s for example, lo’i, there’s walls or there’s any historic resources, but I think it’s just asking that SHPD’s concurrence be expanded to more than the streambed, but to where they may be doing construction activity that could have impacts on historic properties.
So, when we approve this, are we approving the permit or are we holding back on the permit until we hear about them?
You’re basically approving the permit on the condition once SHPD, State Historic Preservation Division, uh provides their letter of concurrence or any necessary actions that uh the applicant has to undertake, uh which may be certain things like uh conduct an AIS survey or certain actions.
I think Larry we’re delegating to Dean. Once SHPD comes in with their concurrence letter, if there are conditions then that’s delegated to Dean to include it on the permit conditions. If for example, Board of Water Supply finds any of those conditions unacceptable then they can always come back to the Commission, but otherwise that would be. So, nothing stops, it’s just procedure.
That’s all I was asking whether it was going to be delegated to the staff to reach the final decision. If that’s why...
Yes.
Then okay.
Thank you for that clarification. PUBLIC TESTIMONY - None
