low-permeability dikes, volcanic dikes that have impounded groundwater to hundreds of feet above sea level. And where the erosion has exposed the dikes, then water discharges from these dike compartments feeds streams and supports stream base flow. When you take water from this system, and again you have water table decline and reduction of groundwater discharge to streams and springs and things on the land. There's also reduction of groundwater discharge to the ocean. There is some saltwater encroachment near the coast, but for the most part, this area is not gonna be affected by saltwater intrusion.

Okay. And then there's the thickly saturated aquifers. These are aquifers that are not highly permeable, that the entire aquifer is made up out of low-permeability rock. And in particular, the example that I've worked on is the one on Kaua‘i in the Lihue Basin where lava flows—thick lava flows have filled in preexisting depressions and formed these thick low-permeability aquifers. And in this case, the freshwater saturates all the way to the land surface, and much of the—excuse me—much of the groundwater discharge occurs at streams above sea level. So, of course, if you take water from that, one of the biggest impacts is going to be to—would be reduction in streamflow. There is also reduction of groundwater discharge to the ocean. There likely is saltwater encroachment near the coast, but, you know, this
