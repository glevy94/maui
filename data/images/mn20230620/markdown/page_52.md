resources on the stream.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Great. Yeah, yeah.  
It'd just be nice to sort of have a little bit more detail around it to demonstrate that. So, okay, I mean, I don't know this stream, so it would help to understand because, I mean, a big construction project will have short-term and long-term implications for this.

CHAIR CHANGE: If I can kind of just add on, Dean, and maybe Kaleo, what I am finding is that we don't -- we don't have really good baseline data on a lot of our streams, so, you know, it's very difficult. We're all -- and Mr. Arakaki, I don't question your -- your comments; however, I think scientific data is gonna be really helpful to us in the long run. I am -- I believe if we had good stream gauges -- is there a possibility that we could ask -- or maybe I should ask you, Mr. Arakaki, given -- given the project that you're doing, are you guys willing to put in a stream gauge in Kipapa to at least give us some good data to monitor the impacts? We hope you are absolutely correct; no impacts by this activity in the stream, but a -- anecdotal is nice, but having some scientific measure -- so we have a really hard time, the state, putting on stream gauges, but is that a possibility that you could do that?

Oh, Ayron, what do you think?  
DR. STRAUCH: (Inaudible) to let him dance.
