**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Is it their landowner?  
**MR. USAGAWA:** It should be, yeah, they own the majority of the land.  
**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** They own the golf course. Is it their -- is that golf course lease renewal kind of part of their -- is that an assumption?  
**MR. USAGAWA:** Yes.  
**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Has there been discussion with them to see if that's the highest and best use of that land in terms of their unique mission?  
**MR. USAGAWA:** No, we didn't talk about -- as far as I remember, we didn't talk about changing or, you know, closing the golf course. It was trying to supply it with an alternative source.  
**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** You might want to just broach the discussion with them. I'm not saying it's an easy -- it's an easy -- there's a lot of reliance and acceptance of the golf course, but given their mission, what it provides for their mission is fairly limited in relationship to the impact of this being the largest water user in -- in that area. And granted, yeah, if they could get off potable, that would be helpful to this equation, but by the same token, that's a lot of land that might be -- have a more powerful contribution to their mission if redeployed.  
**CHAIR CHANG:** I'm gonna be a little bit more candid.
