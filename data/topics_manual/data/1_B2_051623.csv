Approval of Stream Diversion Works Permit Application (SDWP.5991.6) and Special Conditions, East Maui Irrigation Company, LLC, Abandon Registration of Stream Diversion Works Nos. 234, 254, 238, 273, 260, 150, 262, and 173; Remove Pipes and Seal Intakes; Hoʻolawa, Waipiʻo, Oanui, West ʻOʻopuola Tributary, ʻOʻopuola, ʻOʻopuola Tributary, and Makanali Streams, Maui; Tax Map Key(s): (2) 1-1-001:042; 2-9-014:001- 002, 007, and 009; and
Declare that Project is Exempt from Environmental Assessment Requirements under Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 343, and Hawaii Administrative Rules Chapter 11- 200.1
The NH diversion 234 is the Hoʻolawa nui intake on the new Hamakua ditch. The ditch runs under the stream and there is a dam across the stream channel that pools up water. The water would spill into a trash rack and then flow into the new Hamakua ditch. The abandonment proposal is to seal the intake so that no water can be diverted. It is not clear if anything can be done to the wall, but to the extent practicable, they will remove a part of it so that no water pools up. Under existing low flow conditions, there is no flow.However, proposed additional modifications to Hoʻolawa nui at Wailoa ditch, which is upstream of here, will increase the base flow to the stream. Therefore, there is expected to be some flow here. The idea is to prevent the diversion of any flow, low or high, at this location and allow it to continue downstream. This is an abandonment of the stream diversion works, so no water will ever be diverted at this location.
what I'd like to do is Ayron, you do your overview for each of these and any questions from the Commissioners. Then I'd like to make sure that either Ken or Roy confirms that Ayron’s description is consistent with your understanding. So, any questions from the Commissioners on Ayron's overview?
we know that the issue is going to arise as to how much you have the applicant remove so in this case, they're not removing everything.
no because you can see the concrete structure that the ditch flowing in right here, so this is the ditch is flowing right here.
we'll break that wall and create a gap and capture flow, but the applicant will be allowed to leave in place all that other infrastructure.
yeah, like this wing wall here it keeps debris out of the ditch. There are parts of the concrete specifically protecting the ditch. I believe some of these walls can be removed but I don't know to the extent how much.
so, Ayron, the current recommendation is just to remove the grate and seal the hole in a ditch and there's been no recommendations to modify that wall at this time.
that’s not what I heard.
correct so that's why I'm speaking to them across the box, and this is also internal coordination. So, we have a permit branch and Dean is in charge of both the current side as well as the in-stream side. So, we're cross walking the recommendation which is primarily focused on the IIFS. And then the permitting or abandonment of the diversions that's handled by another branch in surface water. So, what's being proposed or recommended in the application is to remove the grate and seal the hole, so the intake no longer functions. But there's been no recommended modifications of that wall that's basically holding up the ditch. Ayron said he thinks it could be done, that's not what's in the application. I just want to make that clear.
there might be modifications to the wall that are permissible without damaging the structural integrity of it. These modifications could include notching the wall, putting pukas through it, or concrete over the intake. The primary purpose is to remove the diversion from its function by sealing it. Concrete over the intake would ensure that no water could be diverted.
Roy actually has the applications up which I think is not visible by the Commissioners. But Roy can look at the applications on what was submitted and clarify any differences.
thank you Ken, generally what Deputy Manuel clarified is correct. There was nothing about the removal of the wall that Ayron is talking about. It is just sealing the intake to allow all the floors to bypass.
I would maybe recommend that the submittal request that EMI evaluate how much of the wall can be removed, without damaging the integrity of the ditch and proceed with that.
Ayron maybe to help facilitate the conversation. With a re-establishment of the IIFS or modifications upstream of this diversion, what is the flow that's anticipated below that upper diversion or is this the losing part of the stream or is it a gaining part of the stream?
it's a gaining stream. There is a large lava tube at the base of a waterfall just below the Wailoa ditch on Ho‘olawa nui. The goal is to get all of these low flows downstream to the in-stream values such as recreational needs, repairing uses, and aquatic habitat. To the extent that we don't want the water pooling up behind the dam, pukas can be put into it if a notch can be cut out of it to convey the water downstream more effectively.
I am wondering if it would be better for staff to go back and work with the applicant and then resubmit the application when there has been some internal discussion. I am concerned about Ken’s HRS 343 question, and do you think it might be more productive to have an internal discussion with the applicant before proceeding?
I think we can work through it today. I don't think many of the recommendations are substantial. I'm busy on the in-stream use section side of things as you will find out later and finding time to meet to discuss regulatory issues is challenging.
Kaleo, do you have a recommendation?
yeah, I’m open. The goal is to give the commission a timeline to modify and abandon in order to meet the IIFS. There was a similar recommendation in November, an application that came in and the proposed modifications. If we could potentially defer and have this conversation in the June quarterly meeting as it relates to abandonments and then come back in July or August if you feel more comfortable.
because based on hearing Ken's opening remarks; and just my own concern part of your submittal isn't 343 exemption and if indeed we are going to be doing work that may trigger 343. I would rather have that internally discussed before it comes back to the commission.
can we walk through the submittal however. I don't believe that we're that far off with what Ken had an issue with. Many of these modifications are going to be full stream diversion abandonments which the applicant knows wasn't up for discussion.
yeah, Ayron let's table for now because I'd rather make sure we are in alignment before we continue the conversation so we can just defer for now.
We don’t need a motion on that.
no, we’ll defer for now.
they still have the right to testify.
yes. Commissioners, do you have any questions about the deferral and what's being proposed? We'll take public comments.
Thank you for bringing this up. It seems that Mr. Kawahara may have provided some misleading information. I want to clarify the importance of the distinction between temporary and permanent abandonment. According to Black’s Law Dictionary, “abandon:” means to give up, cease to use, forsake, entirely, or renounce utterly. When a structure is abandoned but left in place, it implies that the structure will remain there permanently. If the proposed structures are abandoned in place within the stream, it could lead to legal challenges in the future if you decide to remove them after two, ten, or twenty years. By expressing their intention to abandon the structures, they are essentially indicating a desire for permanent abandonment. This highlights the significance of the recommendations from the Division of Aquatic Resources, which your staff has agreed to. These recommendations aim for a balanced approach and advocate for the removal of structures where feasible instead of leaving them abandoned in place. It’s worth noting that the Sierra Club doesn’t request the removal of every single structure in every stream being proposed for abandonment. The focus is on areas where it is possible and appropriate to remove the entire structure, rather than abandoning it in place. The financial responsibility for these structures should not be shifted onto the Sierra Club or washed away. They should not be left in the stream as it goes against the objective of preserving the stream’s integrity. Additionally, the amount of water proposed to be left in these streams is minimal. The diversions being discussed do not aim for full restoration, and it is doubtful that any of them achieve 64 percent of the base flow. These streams require more water to sustain their health. When considering Mr. Kawahara’s suggestion that these structures may be needed for future water requirements, implies that all the water from these streams will eventually need to be removed. This is a path we should not venture down. We should no longer deplete streams entirely, and that’s why the permanent removal of the proposed abandoned structures is crucial. If they express a need for more water from these streams in the future, they should be required to go through the process of justifying their request, as outlined in a 343 document. They should apply and provide a case for whether all the water should be taken from these streams. This process is necessary and should be followed, just as it was historically more than 100 years ago. It’s important to support the permanent removal of abandoned structures and engage in productive conversations that align with this approach. Lastly, if this matter is to be discussed further, it would be helpful to have additional and improved photographs that present a more comprehensive picture, particularly concerning the abandoned PVC and other pipes that are not adequately depicted in the existing photographs. Thank you.
