## PUBLIC TESTIMONY  

**CAROLYN AUWELOA:** I really have a lot of catching up to do with regards to the situation in West Maui and in particular my interest is the R1 use. I’m sorry, Fred, is that your name tag? It's very hard to read on Zoom. It was very educational for me, I'm making some contacts there in Maui. I come from agriculture and I'm working with my brother in the Ku‘ia area and the lack of water for agriculture is such an issue and so I'm just moving home and I'm trying to get caught up on where things are at, where the process is for bringing the R1 water farther south, hopefully. I'm trying to just get in the rooms where sometimes this is being talked about and explore who's been working on this, who's trying to help make this happen or what are the obstacles and if there are ways that I can kōkua to try to have it move forward. Not that I swing any big sticks, but I've got a lot of energy and I'm very passionate about this subject and agriculture and the community in Lahaina and West Maui and the environment. You'll probably see me more and I think it'll always be friendly, so don't worry. I just know the water wars have been going on in West Maui for a very long time. The fact that we haven't figured it out, how to utilize more of this R1 water that's been such a wasted resource, in my opinion, for so long is too bad and we can't let it continue. I think this is a great turning point and opportunity to especially all with of the interest for how can we improve things in Lahaina for climate resilience, for fuel load, for wildfire mitigation, for climate change resilience, all of the above reasons- the R1 kind of seems like a natural good candidate. That's where my interest is and I'm just trying to learn and trying to understand the history and the current status of things and looking for opportunities to maybe have conversations and try to move it forward or see if there's ways that we can help whoever's been trying to move it forward, to overcome whatever obstacles might be in the way.  

**CHAIR CHANG:** Thank you for joining us today, thank you very much.  

**JOHN HELLY:** I’m here, I'm John Helly. My background is as a scientist in oceanography, Earth sciences and geophysics, sort of topics. I've been a resident of Maui for 23 years plus and currently a member of the Board of Water Supply. I'm not speaking for the Board of Water Supply, I'm not representing any points of view in that regard. I was here to understand the timing of the review process for the permits because despite what I just said, I'm a chair of a temporary investigative group for the Board of Water Supply and it's important to our planning as to when we expect to see these somewhere between 100 and 200 permit applications in order to review them effectively. However, I think the presentation by Dean addressed my main concern which is trying to get a status of the timing of all that and I'll just leave you with a comment that we have a meeting on Thursday that's going to be at least partially addressing some of the issues that were just under discussion and I'd encourage anyone interested to pay attention to that meeting, thank you.
