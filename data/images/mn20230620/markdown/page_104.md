comfort level that Board of Water Supply could open up their shafts again. That's really more like years rather than months.

MR. IMATA: That -- you know, that's kind of hard to say. I mean, the -- we, staff has been sort of -- staff has been addressing the deep -- the monitor well applications as fast as we can in order to aid in the -- in assessing what's happening. And, you know, they've been coming in for maybe -- I want to say maybe 15 wells a year or so, and they've been getting them online relatively quickly, maybe -- maybe within about a year. Again, I'm not -- I can't speak on behalf of the Navy, but they've expanded out their drilling sort of roster into maybe three or four drillers at this point, whereas they only had one driller prior. And I think they're just trying to accelerate drilling monitor wells all over the place. So it's hard for me to say, but based on the plan, it would appear maybe within a year or two as far as what has been planned so far, I think all of the wells should be in place and online. I -- that's my best estimate.

DEPUTY MANUEL: And, Commission Buck, maybe real quick, we did make a request -- because they are collecting data now in whatever wells have been completed -- to the Navy in their next quarterly update, which is next month, unfortunately, to provide kind of like -- if possible, a summary of what they're seeing.
