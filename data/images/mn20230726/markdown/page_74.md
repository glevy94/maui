I know we can dig it up and look at it under tables, but then -- and there's a system in place to do a rapid response if something bad happens during defueling, but I guess, like, it's -- to me, it seems more important to have like a really tight monitoring system in place because the way model building works is like you need data to -- to validate your model, so you have to have your monitoring network and, like, it has to be high frequency, and then you can build the model. But the model is only gonna tell you something useful in the future if you have a release again, which we hopefully won't --
