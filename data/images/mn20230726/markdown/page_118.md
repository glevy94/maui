COMMISSIONER MIIKE: Okay.

DEPUTY MANUEL: -- too, Commissioner Miike. I think, you know, this is one dataset we use as staff to come up with recommendations on any adjustments to sustainable yield and the timeframe for that. There is another study that's being -- hopefully gonna get published by the end of this year, which is the impact of climate change on recharge. So there's the recharge values, there's this -- the hydrology evaluation, these different hydrologic conditions, and scenarios that we have to consider. And as you mentioned, the sustainable yield and the RAM model is -- crude, right? It has a lot of assumptions built into it. And so part of our challenge, I think, working with Ryan and his groundwater team, working with Ayron and Dean with surface water, is to look at this more comprehensively.

Maybe just to -- for clarification, Scot, you know, in your maximum pump scenarios, which looks at future increases, is that based on pump capacity, or was that based on water use permit allocations because we're in a groundwater management area?

DR. IZUKA: Yeah, it was on permit allocations.

DEPUTY MANUEL: Permit allocations, okay.

DR. IZUKA: Yeah, yeah. I got it from (inaudible).

DEPUTY MANUEL: So just getting to your -- towards
