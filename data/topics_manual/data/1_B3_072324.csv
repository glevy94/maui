Modification of Existing Delegation to the Chairperson, Dated December 19, 2023, to Approve Certain Well Construction and Pump Installation Permits by Limiting the Delegation to Certain Circumstances When the Well is in Compliance with the Hawai‘i Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards and for Pumps Less than 27 Gallons Per Minute and Delegation to the Deputy Director for Other Groundwater Permit-Related Approvals Including Acceptance of Applications for Initial Review, Permit Extensions, and Well Completion Reports and Certificates
Ryan Imata, Ground Water Regulation Branch Chief
Staff stated the summary of request to revise the delegations to approve well and pump permits set by the Commission on December 19, 2023, after the Commission’s directive to consult with the Departments of Water Supply and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.
ßCommissioner Kagawa-Viviani did include some written questions, “Clarification: I assume all well construction permits flowchart applies, regardless of water management area or non-water management areas.” Ryan, you had recognized that and made the appropriate changes to the flowchart. “Number 2: the submittal presumes all Commissioners are familiar with WCPIS (Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards), I don't think they are.” I don't think we do. It'd be helpful if Ryan could provide a succinct overview of the WCPIS to educate us more broadly.
Okay. “Groundwater overdraft and increasing contamination and scarcity is a widespread and accelerating phenomena in many places beyond Hawaiʻi” and so it sounded like she just wanted a better education so that people understand these standards and how these standards protect, as you say, the ecosystems from contamination. I think she did feel it was important that there be some additional information provided.
Aloha mai kākou Commissioners and Chair Chang. For the record, my name is Cherie Kaʻanana. I'm the water program specialist at the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. This is Dr. Jonathan Likeke Scheuer, he's our consultant. First, we'd like to thank staff for meeting with us. We had a very productive conversation and are supportive of the revisions to the submittal. While we had suggested to not exempt permits that are located in aquifers where DHHL has a reservation, we recognize that specifically the Pāhoa Aquifer has a high yield of permits and we're open to exempting those in order to provide a workable solution. We also had a discussion about transparency with your staff and agreed that it can be improved and we look forward to working with staff to improve this transparency.
Very good, thank you very much. I appreciate it and Ryan, I appreciate reaching out to DHHL and working and sort of bridging this. They are indeed a partner with us, they are going to be by our side. Thank you, appreciate the testimony.
Good morning Chair and Commissioners. I just wanted to stand on our supporting testimony for staff recommendations that was submitted in the last meeting and available for any questions. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Barry and we did receive testimony from Keith.
