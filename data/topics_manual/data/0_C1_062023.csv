Ready? Good morning, Chair and Commissioners. Ryan Imata. I am the program manager for thGroundwater Regulation Branch. Today I'm going to be presenting to you a briefing on Item C-1. This will be a briefing on the commission's data on wells related to the Red Hill fuel tank crisis. So let me share my screen first. I think you can all see that now, so I'm going to give you a little bit of an overview of my presentation today. It should take about maybe 10 minutes or so. And this is kind of a little bit of a spoiler for you.
So the items I'm gonna go over, first of all, are 1. What are the commission's deep monitor well data, and what does that tell us about the aquifers in question? Well, the punch line is the aquifers are robust, and they're relatively healthy right now. 2. The second item I'm gonna go over is the well pumpage for the three wells on the Navy system, and the good news about that is the Navy wells are being pumped within the allocated amounts that the commission has allocated to them, and chlorides are stable. 3. The final point I'm going to discuss is the Navy monitor wells that have been both drilled so far and what is being proposed.
So my next slide is showing you the aquifer system areas on Oahu, and that our primary — can you see my cursor? Our primary area of concern is generally Waipahu-Waiwa because this is the extent of the Navy's water system and  their source  the Waiawa Shaft is up here  and primarily Waimalu and Moanalua where the Red Hill Tank Farm is located. So, first of all, let's talk about our deep monitor well data. I'm going to show you the areas that  the three deep monitor wells that I'm gonna sort of talk to you about with respect to what we're seeing in the aquifer. First of all, there's the Waipio Mauka well. This is  if you know the area, this is located on the road headed up to the Mililani Mortuary. This is located within the Waipahu-Waiawa Aquifer system area. We have a Waimalu deep monitor well that's located within the Waimalu Aquifer system area, and we also have our Halawa deep monitor well, which is also actually located within Waimalu, and then this  this boundary right here is the Moanalua Aquifer system. So I want to show you  this is a little bit of a blowup. So these are the Halawa and the Waimalu deep monitor well locations relative to some critical shafts. Right? So this is Halawa Shaft that the board operates, and this is  this, as you know, has been shut down for quite a while. This is the Red Hill Shaft that the Navy operates. And so I just wanted to give you some  some reference for the location of the Halawa deep monitor well and the Waimalu deep monitor well, and what this is  what the data is telling us about the aquifer relative to the shafts. free to stop me if you have questions on specific slides or anything that I'm saying. That might be easier than  than going  going back at the end, but it's certainly up to  up to you guys. So let's talk about the aquifer health and those deep monitor wells. The commission looks to aquifer health by assessing data which we plot showing historic elevations of a couple of things The water level that we initially encounter when we drop our equipment down the well, the top at midpoint of the transition zones from fresh to saltwater. In the following slides, you're going to see data compiled from field investigations that our survey branch has done near our Red Hill facility, and these data are presented as a time series. So, first of all, if you can remember Halawa deep monitor well, Halawa deep monitor well is located on the Halawa Prison site. And this is something that we're not quite sure about, but the thickness of the freshwater lens  and I'll show you the profile in the next slide. The thickness of the freshwater lens located near Halawa deep monitor well is obscured by an up flow of brackish water in the well. And so I'll explain that a little bit more in the next slide. However, the elevations of the top of the transition zone, midpoint of the transition zone, and the location of seawater indicate that the conditions are relatively stable in this region of the aquifer to the next slide, you'll see that there  there were some  I think a little bit of decline prior to 2010. We're trying  still trying to figure out what that's attributed to, but as you can see, since  since around 2010-2011, this is the water table. This is the top of the transition zone, this is the midpoint of the transition zone, and this is seawater. And I will note that, again, the  the brackish up-flow has kind of made us question the thickness of the  of the brackish lens, but I will also note that  this gets a little bit technical, but we have a way of estimating the midpoint of the transition zone through the  through the Ghyben-Herzberg equation. The Ghyben-Herzberg equation takes into account the water table above mean sea level and calculates the midpoint of the transition zone is about 40  40 times initial head. So if it's one foot, it's 40 feet. If it's two feet, it's 80 feet, and so on. So this line here represents what we would calculate from Ghyben-Herzberg as the midpoint of the transition zone. Fortunately, it appears that the midpoint of the transition zone is still far below the Ghyben-Herzberg calculated midpoint of the transition zone So what is this telling us? It's telling us that based on what we know, despite the up-flow or (inaudible) flow of the  of the brackish water, we think that it's both relatively stable and relatively healthy because this midpoint is far below what we would calculate as the midpoint of the transition zone. So that's data on our Halawa deep monitoring well. Next, let's go to Waimalu. So Waimalu is located, I suppose, northwest of the Red Hill fuel tank storage facility. It does appear that the freshwater lens in Waimalu continues to thicken, indicating that it's probable that there's a long-term influx of fresh water from the Ko'olaus And the second point is just  it's something that we're kind of speculating, so it's by no means definitive, but the presence of this increasing thickness of fresh water makes us theorize that there may be a hydraulic buffer for the Halawa Shaft that the deflects releases migrating northwest across Halawa Valley from the storage facility. Again, that's a theory, so we can't define that yet, but as you'll see at the end of my presentation, data is being collected to understand what's happening with respect to the plume and  and so you'll see that at the end. Okay? So that's Waimalu.
Yeah, Ryan.  
Yeah.  
So the theory, that theory, how would that affect contaminants that would come out of the Red Hill facility?  
Yeah. Thank you, Commissioner Buck. So I guess our theory is that if there is a high flux of watecoming from the Ko‘olaus, there could  there could potentially be a hydraulic buffer between Halawa  between the bulk storage facility and Halawa Shaft, but that sort of remains to be seen with the data that we are collecting from  or not that we're collecting, but the Navy is, and their consultants are collecting from the deep water  from the monitor wells. Does that answer your question?
So the volume of the water would deflect any contaminants and stop its westward movement? Is that  is that what I'm hearing?
Yeah, I mean 
In theory.
I mean, you're  in theory, I don't know if  that it would deflect it, but it would suggest that there's a large quantity of water coming down from the Ko‘olaus  and again, you know, the location of 
Let me back up a couple of slides. So the location of  the location of Waimalu deep monitor well, it's  you know, it's all the way over here. The facility is actually around here. Right? So 
Yeah.
So, you know, there's this  you know, one of the  one of the thoughts that our geologists had was that because so much water is coming down and we see a thickening of the lens here, that it  could that suggestre's  rather than having lateral flow this way, 'cause it's helped to deflect the flow away from Halawa Shaft if there's contaminants coming from the fuel storage tank facility. That's just  again, it's just a theory, so I don't want to really put too much weight into that right now until data is collected from  from the monitor wells.
Ryan, if the theory is important, what's the process for either proving it or negating it?
So I know that as part of the  and perhaps Commissioner Seto can  can address this. I know that there were portions of the administrative order on consent that required determination of groundwater flow patterns and  and groundwater modeling. So I don't know that our theory would necessarily be  how do I say this? I think that we would  we would understand better if the  the thickening of the lens in the context of what the models are estimating. Does that make sense?
Not  not to me.(Laughter.)
Okay, okay. Just 
Let me 
Go ahead.
Go ahead and finish this.
Oh, no. I was just gonna say that   don't think that that  I mean, it could be  the data that we're collecting from this deep monitor well could certainly be used by whoever is preparing the model in estimating groundwater flow, but in and of itself, I don't know that  that we  that that provides us enough data to really make a defining statement on groundwater flow patterns. Because, again, you'll see the proximity of this well to the fuels tank facility, and you see the location of Halawa Shaft, it's far enough away that it  it really is just a theory right now that would be validated once the model gets created and  and if it's  if our data can be used as an input parameter to the model, that's a good thing. Right? But I  I'm not a modeler, I don't understand that component of it, so, again, I  I think that perhaps our theory may be validated by whatever the model tells us, but I'm not sure that we can really make any definitive statement about it. I hope that made sense.
Yeah, quick question. Oh, I'm sorry.
No, go ahead.
Question, Ryan. So we  you're groundwater, and you focus on 
Yep.
sort of what you can measure from a borehole, and that's just  but that's just like one
Yep.
seepage runs done in this area? Can we consider health  you know, if  if we have gaining streams in this area, and I don't know if there are, can we get a sense of the health? Has  has staff kind of considered sort of multiple streams of data together? Because we might just be looking at, like, the pulse and blood pressure when we need to be looking at, I don't know, lung capacity, you know, like other  multiple metrics of  of aquifer health.
No, that's 
Have we kind of fully squeezed the CWRM USGS data?
Thank you. That's a  that is a great question. Right now, you know, we're sort of tasked  we are a very small branch within CWRM and really focusing a lot of our efforts on statewide monitoring, especially as emerging issues come out in Kona  that's not emerging, it's been  it's been emerged for quite a while now  and Lahaina. And so we  we have a staff of basically two guys that are going out to  to evaluate (inaudible). We are, incidentally  and thank you to Deputy Manuel. We are expanding our monitor well program to expand out, but, you know, regarding seepage runs and stream data, you know, I'll let maybe Dr. Strauch and he branch lead, Dean, maybe comment on that to really assess aquifer health as a  in a more holistic manner.
I'll  I'll jump in real quick, and then if Ayron comes back, he can jump in. So I think you hit it on the head. Our groundwater guys are good at what they do, right, evaluating water levels, chlorides, the  the profile, right, of our aquifer, and oftentimes the changes in  in groundwater take years, if not decades to see, right, over time. So it's kind of just monitoring that. It's not a  you know, a rain event that all of a sudden our aquifer increases exponentially. But with that said, we do know there's interaction, and there's additional data sets and data gaps that we potentially need to fill. Kind of we're  you know (inaudible) of what Chair Chang had mentioned, we  the more data we have, the better and more informed decisions we can make holistically as it relates to aquifer health. So there  there are studies here. These are some gaining streams, so there is a groundwater-surface water connection per my initial conversations with Dr. Strauch. And if that's him, he can also add in.(Laughter.)
Perfect timing. But there are spring sources, as we're aware of, along the coast which also indicate kind of this interaction or something  geology, right, creating that space for ground and surface waterinteraction. So we do look at it holistically. A lot of it's just taking the components of groundwater's research, the components of surface water's research, data from Department of Health and UH, and kind of putting that together and then looking at, okay, well, what is the management recommendations that we want to propose? Our primary tool in this region is water use permits, right, and the conditions of how  you know, the withdrawal of water and the impact that it has on both ground and surface water resources as well as public trust uses. So it's all connected. I just want to  I think we can add more to this. This is just one component, and we wanted to respond to the question from  I think (inaudible) question about, Can we  Can we have a conversation about the data that we're collecting? We hear a lot of DOH data, we hear a lot about Navy data, but what is the data that we're collecting? That's the purpose of today's presentation, to share that with you, get feedback on if you want us to focus or if there's things that you're seeing are missing, let us know, and we can look at what resources we have to try to fill those gaps.
Okay. So the  so the short answer is data streams, we don't have  we haven't put together the multiple streams of data, but according to deep monitor wells, it looks pretty good.
The groundwater aquifer health -
Yeah, yeah.
at this point. And he'll keep going through the rest of the system.
Yeah. I don't want to hold that up.
No, no, no. That's  yeah, that's the general summary. I think you'll be hearing that as well.
Okay. So I  I believe this is where I left off, I think. We were looking at particularly Waimalu deep monitor well and how thick  lens thickening is  is maybe suggesting a hydraulic buffer. So as you can see as a time series, we have  the water table actually rose. It rose about maybe 18 and a half feet from May to April, May  from 2005 till 2023. We do see again a thickening of the transition zone here. And this is, again, Ghyben-Herzberg. So this is telling us that where it should be, and maybe it's  maybe it's arriving at a steady state condition, I don't know, but that this is  this is the data that we're collecting from the Waimalu deep monitoring well. So the last well that we're going to look at is the Waipio mauka deep monitor well. And again  shucks, you know what? We'll  I'll give you a little bit better information on this as we go through the Navy system wells. But again, this is the Waipio mauka deep monitor well that's located. right off of the road going up towards that Mililani Cemetery. So we see in this well the freshwater lens continues to slowly thin about may  well, about 100 feet. I don't know if you can say that's slow, but  but it's been 37 years since we've seen that. The elevation of the midpoint of the transition zone shows a gentle rise, but again, the current elevation is still below the calculated Ghyben-Herzberg elevation, which indicates to us that the current thickness is greater than expected. So going to the next slide, you can see again, this is  this is Ghyben-Herzberg, that's the midpoint of  this is the midpoint of the transition zone. So this is the top of the transition zone. So we are quite significantly below the calculated Ghyben-Herzberg midpoint of the transition zone. And again, this well is located kind of close to the Navy's Waiawa Shaft, which they are  they've placed a hundred percent reliance on to supply water for existing. So that's a good segue into the next portion of my presentation, which is talking about Navy system pumping centers. So 
Ryan, Ryan, excuse me. Before you go on to the next subject.
Sure.
I'm curious. The thickening has occurred since 2005. Could  might the Waiāhole water decision and/or the diminished use of water for sugar have contributed to less withdrawal and more retainment?
So  so it appears that Waipio mauka has actually  the water level is rising, but we're also seeing a rise of the midpoint  at the top of the transition zone and the midpoint of the transition zone, so, you know, that would suggest some  some kind of  I don't know. I mean, at this point, could that suggest some kind of depletion? I'm not really sure. Yeah, that's a great question. I mean, we  with respect to Waiāhole, we see development tunnels are quite  still actively in use, and I believe that though the development tunnels are on the windward side, they do extend  it appears that they may extend hydrologically possibly into the Waipahu-Waiawa Aquifer system. So whether the development tunnels are depleting recharge of Waipahu-Waiawa, that's a  that's a great question. Although, you know, I think that  you know, I'm trying to think of the timeline now. I'm trying to think of Waiāhole Ditch with respect to, you know, the pineapple fields on the Kunia side, and when things started actually transitioning over from  the transition from sugar to pineapple and then pineapple to what's being seen in Kunia is  you know, what we're seeing is diversified crops and some seed corn. I think seed corn is kind of diminishing.- I've really gotta take  take a look at the data for what's  you know, for the Waiāhole withdrawals. Waiāhole is interesting, right, because they  what they do is there's a valve at the  at the north portal that  I think it's the north portal that they turn on and off depending on how much rainfall they get on the leeward side. There's also a development tunnel, Waiwa development tunnel, that actually develops water on the leeward side that  that's never really sort of shut off. Right? So I  it's hard for me to  all that to say that I think it's hard for me to attribute any kind of changes in the aquifer, you know, mauka or even within Waipo mauka as being attributed to sugar  the reduction of sugar production or the change in agricultural use. So the  I guess the short answer is I don't know.(Laughter.)
I know I can be wordy, but it takes up  sometimes I'm processing my thoughts as I'm speaking.(Laughter.)
I can tell.(Laughter.)
If I can interject, Chair, I wanted to suggest  Scott Izuka from USGS, they released a really interesting groundwater availability scenarios report in April, and so maybe that can be 
They're coming next month.(Laughter.)
Okay. They're already on it, yeah.
Sorry, we try to get you the cutting-edge data.
Yeah. Well, WRRC hosted him, so the  the recording might  there might be a previous recording online, and then we'll hear next month. So I think that'll help us because it was really helpful to see his maps and  and have that dialogue, so  okay.
Shall I continue?
Yep.
Yes, go ahead.
Okay, okay. So again, talking about  now we're segueing into the Navy pumping centers. So I'm gonna show you on the next map the three shaft sources that the Navy has for the system. Aiea Halawa Shaft is the smallest source. This has an allocation of 0.697 mgd. Red Hill Shaft is sort of a  I want to say a medium-sized source. It's definitely a lot smaller than the Board of Water Supply's Halawa Shaft, but it does have an allocation of 4.659 million gallons per day. Waiawa Shaft is the most productive shaft in the Waipahu-Waiwa Aquifer system, and it has an allocation of 14.977 mgd. And I will note that these are  all are under a public water system. So here's a map that shows you basically the extent of the Navy system. You can see how far  I mean, it extends all the way out into Ford Island, and then obviously out into the West Loch portion, airport point. Again, the Waiawa Shaft is the farthest sort of  it's not  farthest north, I guess, on the system, and I was mentioning that the  our Waipio mauka monitor well is like around here somewhere. This is  this is the Navy's Aiea-Halawa Shaft, which is a small allocation, like 0.497, and this is Red Hill Shaft, which is located right next to the field tank farm, so  and this one has the allocation of about 4 point  I don't know, under 5 mgd. So again, here's  here's a better map showing the location of the shafts. Here is  here's Waiawa Shaft, here's Aiea-Halawa, here's Red Hill Shaft. So let's look at the pumpage prior to the fuel release and the resulting change in pumpage as a response. So in November of 2021  oh, this doesn't look good. Right? Like in  they were pumping 0.272; they were within their allocation for Aiea-Halawa Shaft. Again, that's a small source. Waiawa Shaft, they were over-pumping at a very  very small on a 12-month moving average, but they were over-pumping it. And Red Hill Shaft was over-pumping by about a half a million gallons per day. So this doesn't look good. Combined 12-month moving average monthly pumpage of 20.363mgd. So the following three slides are just an indication  and this is kind of  it's a little bit  I don't want to be misleading about it because it's hard to tell by the scale. Right? If we're looking at the scale of this, this is really just 0.8 million gallons per day. So we're seeing  we saw a decrease in  in time series of the 12-month moving average from about  so we  so the graphs I'm providing you are from 2020 to the present, and you see a reduction of Aiea  they basically took Aiea-Halawa Shaft offline. I think they were pumping it for some testing purposes or whatever. Red Hill Shaft  let's see. So I think since  I can't remember the date, but they started pumping Red Hill Shaft in order to induce like a plume  plume containment situation. Is that right, Commissioner Seto? And  so they exceeded their allocation. Of course, you know, the allocation that the commission issued was  was for consumptive purposes, but they converted Red Hill Shaft over to pumping it for plume containment. So you'll  again, I don't want  I don't want this to be sort of  well, you can see. I mean, it's a  it was about  above their allocation. Maybe they  they peaked by about 0.2 mgd at one point and then started stepping down their pumpage of Red Hill Shaft. the last graph, again, I think this is  this one's a little bit confusing because you'll see my time series goes from 12.5 to 17. So if I had  if it went all the way down to zero, I think you'd have a better idea of how much they were over-pumping Waiawa Shaft. And I'm not making excuses for the Navy, by any means, but Waiawa Shaft was  is the only source that's online to supply their entire water system. So you can see how much in excess they did pump. We did  we are keeping tabs on their  both their pumpage and the chlorides of Waiawa Shaft on a more  a finer scale So let's talk about the change in pumpage as  in response to the release. Red Hill Shaft stopped in December 2021 and resumed on January 29, 2022, for plume containment, and they've been pumping an average of about 4.2 mgd Pumpage ceased at Aiea-Halawa Shaft at the same time. Pump started up again in September of 2022, and I think they just run the pumps periodically just for a couple of days a month, and they only pump about a hundred thousand gallons a month And then  oh, I'm sorry. And then Waiawa Shaft has always  again, that's the one that they exceeded their allocation for, and we've discovered  or they've discovered leaks in the system that can be  can speak to why they were over pumping. And at a certain point, they pumped 16.993 million gallons per day, but they  again, they're reducing pumping Waiawa Shaft, I think partly due to some efficiency measures, and also, they had fixed  there was a big leak in the Pearl Harbor Peninsula that they fixed. And so you see that their 12-month moving average as of May 2023 is 14.9 mgd, which is below their allocation.
And again, just a leak in the water system just for verification because that was  we did this presentation prior, and there was concern that it was in the actual fuel system. No, it's the water system that Ryan's talking about.
Thank you. Yeah, that  I should have been a little clearer about that. I think it was  it was those kinds of water distribution leaks that you see in all big water systems, right, Board of Water Supply. And so they discovered one. And I think this is  I think maybe that's part of the silver lining in this whole situation is it  it's caused us to put a lot more scrutiny on the Navy's data with respect to both the pumpage, aquifer health, and  and particularly salinity. So this slide shows the current pumpage, and then you'll see that, okay, Aiea-Halawa Shaft is basically offline. Waiawa Shaft, they were brought  you know, they brought their pumpage down below their allocation. Red Hill Shaft, again below their allocation, although this is for plume containment. This is not feeding into the system. And you'll see that the combined 12-month moving average is 18.972 from 20.363 as of November of 2021. So can they sustain running the system with one source? Yes. Is that a good idea? Probably not, because if Waiawa Shaft pulls down, they don't have water for their system. The one thing that we  we wanted to make sure that we looked at was chlorides  and  because chlorides give us an indication of aquifer health too. And so this is a plot of chlorides. So you'll see this scale is pumpage in million gallons per day. This scale is parts  in terms of parts per million. So you see some variability. The orange dots are the chlorides, and you see some variability, but it's relatively  pretty stable and pretty good at about maybe 130, 130 parts per million. Waiawa Shaft is the one that I think we're really  that we're a lot more interested in because as they increase pumpage from Waiawa Shaft to support the system, what does that tell us about the chlorides? Well, the chlorides  I mean, this is  it's relatively fresh water, right? Like between 35 and maybe a high of 44 parts per million. So we see  we see some variability with respect to pumpage, but not too much That takes me through the Navy's water sources. Did you guys have any questions on that section before we move on?
Ryan, Aurora has a question.  
Sure.  
So Waiawa pumping is declining, but we're heading into summer, and do you have any  in general, that's, you know, high water demand time is  I mean, the implication there is that it's probably not going to continue going down over the summer and they will be exceeding that specific  likely be exceeding that specific allocation for that. So what measures or have there been any dialogues around that?  
I mean, I can start, Ryan, real quick. The graph here shows summer month usage. So if you look at it on the 12 MAV, they still fall within their allocation.  
Okay, all right.  
So, in the bottom frames, right?  
Right.  
You know, basically July through August or that period, those are summer months where you would see higher use. So, I mean, in general, we are  we're  what's been great is they've been reporting daily pumpage (inaudible).  
Okay.  
Which we  we don't ask of anybody  
Right, yeah.
So the Navy's been really, really, really good at getting us this data; that's the only reason why we're able to track it at this scale 
Yeah.
over time. And then we  it is on a 12 MAV, right 
Yeah.
with the idea that during summer periods, there might be increased pumping to meet demands and needs, but we also ramp up our conservation efforts working with our planning office and our conservation work. So those are some of the strategies, at least right now, we're working with the Navy  even anybody throughout the state on is conservation strategies and drought preparedness.
Right, yeah. 'Cause it's not looking  you know, the prospects are not looking great.
It is gonna be a prolonged drought per  per models, right, and predictions. So, Ryan, sorry. Sorry to jump in, but go ahead.
No, no. No, that's a  that's a great thing to add. So we also  as Kaleo mentioned, we are looking a both pumpage and chloride data on a finer scale. And normally, what we would require of any well owner or shaft owner or whatever is monthly water use and monthly chloride data to be submitted. We  because of this  because of the concern that we brought up not just for the summer months, but just in general as they increase the pumpage, we were  we were looking at daily pumpage and weekly chloride data to be submitted so that we can kind of start to get a handle, are we seeing  are we seeing chloride starting to increase as their pumping higher? Again, if this is  if the past, you know, two years of data is any indication, I don't think we're going to see chloride increases if  you know, as they approach the summer months. But we'll continue to keep a handle on the data and  present anything to you if we see that anything is  you know, if there's any adverse impacts on the aquifer.
Okay, thanks.
Okay, thanks. So I'll  I'll move on to the next  the final section. I wanted to give you guys a briefing on the Navy monitor well permit. So it's  this is  this is an interesting  and I should preface this by saying that typically the commission approves well permits for  I mean, I would say 90 percent of our permitting is for production-type wells, right, where people drill wells to produce water permit deep monitor wells and permanent deep monitor wells, but a lot of environmental wells that are being done to assess, you know, aquifer water quality are done through  you know, via the underground storage tank program at DOH or other environmental programs. So typically, we hadn't been  been permitting these types of environmental monitor wells. Well, back in around, I think, 2015, and maybe prior to that, we started permitting the monitor wells for the Navy. And I think it's a good  it's a good thing for the commission to be involved because, as we know, there's contamination in the area. For the Navy to be constructing the wells in accordance with our well standards will help us to ensure that if there's contamination in the vadose or the unsaturated zone above the aquifer, you know, adhering to our well standards will help prevent a contaminant from entering the aquifer from above. And not to say that DOH wouldn't be able to do that, but I think our well standards are  are sufficiently designed to protect both that from happening and also from maybe perched water from entering an ungrouted annular space and entering the basal nodes. So  so all that to say that we have been permitting Navy monitor wells. There are 23 existing Navy monitor wells right now in all  all of these various locations. There are eight new proposed Navy monitor wells that we have applications in for that we're under  that are under review. This shows the location of monitor wells with respect to the fuel tank farm. So this is the fuel tank farm right here And then water quality data from the monitor well  so we don't have the expertise within groundwater to analyze water quality data, but thank you to Commissioner Seto for sending me this yesterday. Here are some websites that anybody can go to, the commissioners and general public can go to get water quality data from the monitor wells. So there's the  DOH's Red Hill information website. There's the EPA's groundwater results application which was just released, I think, last month or two months ago. And then there's the Navy's Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Red Hill environmental website And that's basically all I  oh-oh. Start the recording again?
Yeah, you can just press start recording, Kathy.
It's connecting. Like it's not sensing or something.
So can we confirm 
Is it  is it on 
It's a hard connection.
Okay, there we go.
It came back.
Okay, there we goSo that concludes my presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions that you guys have or  I think I see Commissioner Seto smiling, so I'll deflect some questions to her too, but  okay, thank you.
So, Mike.
Yeah, Ryan, thanks a lot. I know the monitoring wells are critical, especially the ones in the west, to get a much better idea of what's in the aquifer and the plume flow. And I know we've got some issues with liability and trying to put the appropriate monitoring wells in, but let's say we put them in there  and again, the  the commission's kuleana is really gonna be long-term aquifer remediation and recovery. What kind of time frame  assuming we get the wells in  did you project before we could start making some determinations kind of the plume? And I know theoretical, we don't know, but this is an issue that is gonna be with the commission for quite a while. Do you have any  any projections of time frames once the monitoring wells are in for us to begin to draw some  some kind of rational, you know, observations?
Yeah, and I don't want to misspeak, and Joanna's certainly here to correct me if I say anything wrong or  or even expand on what I might say. But I know that initially  was it at an FTAC, a Fuel Tank Advisory Committee meeting, Joanna, that I think either EPA or DOH presentesort of  some sort of spatial analysis on plume locations? But I don't know that there's been a time series to represent any sort of changes with respect to how plume containment was  and maybe  and so I'll let Commissioner Seto sort of expand on that if she can.
Just real quick, Ryan, most of the monitoring wells are just around the  the Red Hill facility. We really have not collected data  the wells aren't even in yet, so (inaudible) 
Yeah, thank you. So I will say that I think that there are  like the majority, I'd say just about all of the wells are Navy wells. I know that the Board of Water Supply has, I believe, one monitor well in, and I believe they're applying or are looking to apply for one or two more. So I think that the  you know, I kind of see where you're going with this because I know we had talked about this before, but I'm trying to establish sentinel wells between the fuel tank facility and  and Halawa Shaft. But I don't  I don't have a timeline for the  for that. I think that's a  that's going to be a Board of Water Supply question.
But with an assumption, basically we're talking years having to put the wells in, and hopefully we'll get that done, and then actually getting the data over a certain amount of time frames until there's comfort level that Board of Water Supply could open up their shafts again. That's really more like years rather than months.
That  you know, that's kind of hard to say. I mean, the  we, staff has been sort of  staff has been addressing the deep  the monitor well applications as fast as we can in order to aid in the  in assessing what's happening. And, you know, they've been coming in for maybe  I want to say maybe 15 wells a year or so, and they've been getting them online relatively quickly, maybe  maybe within about a year. Again, I'm not  I can't speak on behalf of the Navy, but they've expanded out their drilling sort of roster into maybe three or four drillers at this point, whereas they only had one driller prior. And I think they're just trying to accelerate drilling monitor wells all over the place. So it's hard for me to say, but based on the plan, it would appear maybe within a year or two as far as what has been planned so far, I think all of the wells should be in place and online. I  that's my best estimate.
And, Commission Buck, maybe real quick, we did make a request  because they are collecting data now in whatever wells have been completed  to the Navy in their next quarterly update, which is next month, unfortunately, to provide kind of like  if possible, a summary of what they're seeing.
Yeah.  
You know, we have some wells completed. What is the data showing now, and can that help to inform some of our management decisions? So we put in the requests and hoping to get some report back from the Navy next month.  
I mean, I've been to the meetings. The Navy is  we're ready, they're ready to go. The major issue is a lot of them are on private land   
Right.  
and the private land owner is not comfortable. They want some liability protection in case they find something, and so that's  and I know DOH has been working with  I mean, that's something, but  yeah, until we get those west monitoring wells in, we're still  really have  don't have much of an idea   
Yeah.  
of what's going on.  
It's definitely isolated around the fuel facility.  
All right.  
Yeah. Ryan, do you have a  an opportunity to sort of  I don't know if synthesize is the right word, but take in, like, EPA, Board of Water Supply, and  and put them all together so that we have a  a larger visual of all of the different wells? And are they all  are they all in sync, or are they different? Or what impacts do those additional well information have for you?
Yeah, let me think about this. So I think that at a certain point, we did a  we did a collaborative effort with USGS. Shoot, I can't  I wish Patrick were here. Patrick is our geologist that can  and Bob, I wish they were here talking about how they calibrated the elevation surveys of all of the wells in the area But in terms of syncing data, I mean, I think that the websites that I had mentioned have results of all of monitor wells in the area. I'm not sure that they have permission receipt  I don't think they have Board of Water Supply data in the area, but there's only one Board of Water Supply monitor well, so  yeah, I think that that would be the best opportunity to see data results from, you know, a more comprehensive scale.
And maybe just  you know, a lot of  we trust in our link, right?
Yeah.
So we're really focusing on a lot of times the aquifer health from a quantity and chloride perspective, which is kind of the sweet spot we fit in in relation to Department of Health, EPA, who is  is managing the water quality data sets from these well fields. PuttinJune 
Yeah.
to try to do more of and be better at, but a lot of the focus has been quality metrics that have been presented. So we can talk about it and see if there's a way for us to use some of maybe the existing data sharing sites that DOH or EPA or the Navy has set up, and then plug in some of our, you know, quantitative data 
Yeah.
into that.
Okay. And maybe that's a  that's a task for UH.
Yeah, I was gonna suggest  I mean, you know, the USGS is 
Yeah, yeah.
very well  you know, they have a really stronger group of geologists, hydrologists, and then UH as well. So I think kind of helping the different organizations find their role in  in the  sort of the network would be good. And I think oftentimes from the researcher's side, you know, people want to help, but they don't know what the right questions are 
Yeah, yes, yes.
and they don't know where the data is. And once the data is available, they  
Right.
People get very excited when there's (inaudible).
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay. So 
I'll pass that word back.
Yes. Thank you, Ryan. Any  has any board members  commission have any questions for Ryan or staff?
I  sorry, I have one other.
Go ahead.
So this is going back to the chlorides being stable at Red Hill Shaft, and I was wondering because Halawa's shut off, you know, I mean  and Halawa used to be a big draw, is  do you think that plays into the chloride story there or it's just the aquifer can handle and, you know?
You know, that's a  that is a good question. I would have to look at the data for  the water use reported data from Red Hill Shaft and compare that to, you
Okay.
Again, if our theory or if our geologist's theory holds true, that large influx of water from the Koʻolaus would  would maybe  could possibly suggest that the shutdown of Halawa Shaft wouldn't impact Red Hill Shaft in a significant way.
Any other questions or comments? Do we have  Jonathan, you've been with us the whole meeting. Did you wanna  were you here to participate on a particular item?
Not at this time, mahalo. Other than I was going to, when it comes to it, thank Commissioner Buck for his years of service.
Oh, okay. Thank you very much. I thought so. Okay. Anybody else?
So my takeaway is generally good news, nothing disturbing in your  in the data you presented, Ryan?
Well, not from a water quality standpoint, right, because again, we can't really 
Right.
We can't really comment on  on the perspective of the presence of contaminants in the aquifer. As far as aquifer health and depletion, that's really where  again, as Kaleo mentioned, that's our sweet spot, right? So based on our increased monitoring of what's happening with respect to Waiawa Shaft and looking at our deep monitor well data, we are relatively confident that any changes in system pumpage isn't affecting the aquifers in a negative way.
Okay, thank you.  And second to Kaleo, the last  I don't know if it was last month or the month before, the Navy made a presentation which really created an opportunity to kind of create a dashboard of various important task completions or objectives and milestones that we could track. Have we kind of done anything with that? Will we be seeing that on some routine basis, quarterly perhaps, or some 
I'm hoping to try to figure out whether it's some kind of informational briefing submittal that we have that we can kind of evaluate what we're seeing related to what they've presented or just have the Navy present on those three things every quarter. So they've agreed  I've consistently reached out, and they agreed to be back in July to update us on those kind of three focal points of the work that they're doing. I'm hopeful that until the fuel is removed or the facility is closed, that they're committed  at least we've gotten commitments from leadership right now that they'll be here. So it is  those three threads and those focuses are where we want to have them provide those updates.
But I like the idea of kind of keeping the destination targets 
Yeah, yeah.
solid, and then measuring milestone and progress 
Yeah, I think 
of those milestones along the way.
I think one of the  in my opinion, kind of seeing the big picture of things, that the biggest issue is the remediation.
(Inaudible.)
And we haven't got there yet. Right? The focus right now has been on defueling safely the facility. But, you know, I think we've been really consistent at the Fuel Tank Advisory Commission  Committee meetings and others, at our subject matter expert meetings, that we've really got to start thinking about what does remediation look like for this  these aquifers.
Yes.
and start that conversation now and not afterwards when you're done reviewing. But we need to have those conversations now 
Right.
and set those goals. We can change 
Yeah.
as we get more data, but we really need to, yeah, know where it is we're going.
Okay.
Wayne.
Hi, Ryan. Has the Navy formed and stood up an organization to meet your expectations moving forward to provide you timely data? And how does that 
Yes.
organization look as to what they've had historically there?
I mean, what we're  I guess it depends on what you mean by what we're looking at. From staff's perspective, we are primarily looking at getting like a finer-tuned reporting of their water use, which that  that came from NAVFAC directly. So in that sense, no As Kaleo mentioned, we are  the commission is part of the  both the Fuel Tank Advisory Committee as well as various subject matter expert groups, maybe the most significant being the Remediation Roundtable. So as far as particular commission objectives, yeah, there's  there's really  there's really nothing that we look at in terms of a larger group. Although, you know, informally, we do consult with several geologists throughout the state about geologic issues as they pertain to monitor wells. Otherwise, commission staff is advisory to the Field Tank  well, we're a part of the Fuel Tank Advisory Committee as well as subject matter experts.
Well, Ryan, is there an opportunity  one of the, to me, issues is that your groundwater staff is sort of limited. Could we avail the Navy's conscience and hopefully, you know, some of their accountability to help improve getting groundwater data to you to  you know, what would normally be your function in doing it, but take advantage of that if they're putting in, you know, 35 sentinel wells around the area? Can we 
No, that's 
task them to do more?
That's a great question and  and actually, timely for me to let you know that the legislature approved four positions under groundwater regulation for that very purpose. So, you know, my thing has always been I would prefer for us to be collecting the data rather than the Navy to be collecting the data because, you know, validation  data validation is an issue. And for us to do that stuff, it gives me much more confidence that we can make better assessments on aquifer health. So we did get four new positions. I'm in the process of trying to figure out how to fill those positions and how to write the position description, so  but whether the Navy can contribute to that, yeah, I would love that, you know.
Well, I think they're obligated to do something.
Now, if I can add to that, so, you know, the  well, the State of Hawai‘i, the state and the counties created this unified statement. Part of the  the goal of this unified statement or this coalition is to bring all of the different agencies together, including the county, to hold the  the Navy accountable for more than just remediation. I mean, so we sit on that, and, you know, my concern is it's  it's not just water quality and water quantity, but the health of our ecosystem. Like what impact does this have to the nearshore waters, up on the streams, up mauka? So we are trying to leverage the Navy through this opportunity to require them to do more data, you know, have them responsible because there's a whole question as to, as you say, Ryan, the validation. I mean, we're only getting information from what the Navy's providing us. We are not having the opportunity to necessarily ground truth that. And that's why to me, having collaboration with other  you know, other monitoring wells, whether the Board of Water Supply  but I think it  right now is the opportunity for us to hold the Navy accountable. Because if our  our goal is not just, you know, clean water with infiltration. I mean, far from that. I mean, we want to be able to have clean water for future generations that doesn't have to all have to go through filtration. We also want to have clean water so our resources are taken care of. So the  part of the mission of this unified statement, this coalition, is to draft federal legislation and to get money to finance this. And it shouldn't be funded by the State of Hawaiʻi; it should be financed by the United States. So we are, as we're speaking, going through that process to try to be very comprehensive and inclusive and bring the right people to the table to begin to identify what's  you know, what's our long-term goal, and then working backwards, how do we  how do we get sufficient information, data, resources to get us to that point. So we are being very 
Good.
cognizant of that.
Good.
Yeah. Any other questions or comments to staff, Ryan or anybody else, on this update? And Kaleo's right, I think, you did confirm with the Navy they'll be here, 
Yeah, they'll be here next  in July.
Yeah. So they are keeping to their commitment to do quarterly updates to us following up on that first meeting. So with that, being this was just an informational briefing, right?
Just informational.
So, having no other comments or questions, thank you very much, Ryan, for a very comprehensive overview.
And think of all our (inaudible).(Laughter.)
Yeah, yeah, you're right. I'm trying 
And throwing ones at the wall.
Yeah, there you go.
I'm sure we've got plenty more.
I want to be cautiously optimistic about the  the data that you gave us and the health, but, you know, preliminary, we've still got a lot more. So with that being said, this item is closed and
