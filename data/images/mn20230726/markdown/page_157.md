**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** So that is in some way --

**MR. USAGAWA:** That was --

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** -- redistributing?

**MR. USAGAWA:** Yes. We provide annual funding to -- because of Act 152, and because we created a stakeholder advisory group with folks like Mark Fox in there, you know, the big advocates for watershed protection, we're funding about 300,000 plus to the Ko‘olau and the Wai‘anae Mountain Watershed Partnerships as well as the O‘ahu Invasive Species Committee, and some funding also is going to DLNR DOFA for on-the-ground projects. Invasive species control like Miconia, Albizia removal, and fencing. And that's an annual thing that we continue to do with -- with our budget. So in a way, you know, the rates are funding that investment in the mauka so that we can continue to make the forests healthier.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** Okay, thank you.

**MR. USAGAWA:** Yeah, (inaudible).

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** (Inaudible) values.

**CHAIR CHANG:** I guess, Barry and Abbey, I think one...
