groundwater. And that's known, there are a number of DWS wells that take advantage of that high-elevation groundwater for drinking water supply. But it also clearly contributes to sustaining stream flow. So it's just really a unique location, and there have been the biota data that are available demonstrates the stream supports native amphibious species, we know it supports a lot of recreational values, and this region has heavily concentrated in archaeological sites that relate to agriculture, both cooler dryland agriculture and wetland agriculture.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** How much is being diverted, and what percent is that of the base flow?

**DR. STRAUCH:** Great question. So the capacity of the diversion off the top of my head is somewhere, I think, 2.5 mgd, between 2 and 3 mgd, and that is a hundred percent of base flow.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** And so, historically, it went all the way down to the ocean?

**DR. STRAUCH:** Yes.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** How far down are those people that -- with the agriculture lots?

**DR. STRAUCH:** They're just below Waimea Town, not far. I mean, it's pretty high up.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** Okay.
