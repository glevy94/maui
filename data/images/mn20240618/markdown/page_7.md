**CHAIR CHANG:** It's been through board action. The board has authorized…

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** So we are consistent with this action today?

**CHAIR CHANG:** Yes, I'm assuming that previously they were consulting with the Attorney General's office and the delegation was not rulemaking. I will say for the Land Board as well, there’s a lot of just delegating to the Chairperson to negotiate a contract or 343. I don't believe this is rulemaking.

**COMMISSIONER HO:** I think the delegation itself is one action and I don't think that is rulemaking. I think we have the authority to delegate to you and that's not rulemaking. It's maybe some other aspects of it which is what criteria, and there's a body of cases which is why I thought it is a legal call, but there are a body of cases where internally the police department or an agency can set forth different criteria and that is not considered rulemaking. I just didn't know where we sit. The delegation I'm clear about, but where we sit on some other aspects of this request like 27 gallons per minute, like when the Chair is able to decide what should go to the greater Commission, those kinds of things. There are cases that address this which I'm just not familiar with.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Are you suggesting that we also seek Deputy Attorney General counsel on this before we take an action? Or Colin?

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Let me ask the question another way. Are you okay with the recommendations that are explicitly stated here that there are delegations subject to certain exceptions?

**COMMISSIONER HO:** I'm okay with the delegation itself. I think we can delegate to the Chair, I'm okay with that. It's the exceptions that I'm on the fence on whether we have the authority on the exceptions or do we have to do something more. In my former life, I remember that body of cases, I'm just not familiar with that line of cases at this point and what I don't want us to do is to act on something and then get…

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** So it's not the fact that we’re making these exceptions, it's the fact how we do it, how we implement that.

**COMMISSIONER HO:** And whether we have the authority versus rulemaking. I'm just interested if to see if the staff has researched this, if our attorney general has some thought on this.

**CHAIR CHANG:** I think that's a valid question regarding whether the Chairperson, in its discretion to say, oh no I don't think this is of public interest, I'm not going to you know. I understand.
