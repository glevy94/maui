"(956.84, 958.92)", I have two questions.,956.84,958.92
"(958.92, 965.6)", What about that 6% of the fuel that you can't defuel immediately makes it problematic why is that,958.92,965.6
"(965.6, 974.8)", a problem um it's not necessarily a problem in terms of um it just randomly now it just takes,965.6,974.8
"(974.8, 982.24)", a long time to remove because it's uh stuck in pipelines at bends or low points um it takes a,974.8,982.24

"(1707.4, 1709.68)"," Honestly, there's three independent efforts going on",1707.4,1709.68
"(1709.68, 1711.2)", in reference to beneficial reuse.,1709.68,1711.2
"(1711.2, 1714.76)", There's the NDAA effort looking at DoD reuse.,1711.2,1714.76
"(1714.76, 1715.6)", There's-,1714.76,1715.6

"(1740.96, 1749.44)", at this time but i know uh finally it will be engagement between the department of defense and the state of hawaii on what the options future options could be,1740.96,1749.44
"(1750.64, 1752.96)", but there must be some criteria for analysis,1750.64,1752.96
"(1754.32, 1760.48)", yes cost time safety public so can you elucidate this so when we get all the options in i'll say,1754.32,1760.48
"(1760.48, 1764.88)", this will be a handful they have merit and the ones that have decided deemed they have merit,1760.48,1764.88
"(1764.88, 1765.04)", are going to go for a feasibility analysis because they have merit and the ones that have decided deemed they have merit are,1764.88,1765.04
"(1765.04, 1770.0)", going to go for a feasibility analysis because they have merit doesn't mean the environmental,1765.04,1770.0
"(1770.0, 1775.04)", approved or utility point of uh approval structural so that we're going to have to do a,1770.0,1775.04
"(1775.04, 1779.92)", final feasibility analysis that feasibility analysis will narrow down the list of options,1775.04,1779.92
"(1779.92, 1785.8)", that are feasible have merit and that are feasible to implement.,1779.92,1785.8
"(1788.6, 1793.14)"," You're giving me process, but I'm not hearing the substance of the criteria like such as time, feasibility and sustainability.",1788.6,1793.14
"(1793.82, 1796.18)", So what sustainable what is sustainability?,1793.82,1796.18
"(1796.68, 1799.86)", It can it's something that can be sustained,1796.68,1799.86
"(1800.56, 1804.32)"," politically, environmentally, financially in the long term.",1800.56,1804.32
"(1805.0, 1805.28)"," And do you think that's reflective? politically, environmentally, financially, in the long term.",1805.0,1805.28
"(1806.76, 1809.72)"," And do you think that's reflective, those criteria are reflective of the concerns",1806.76,1809.72
"(1809.72, 1811.7)", of the public that you're getting from Nakupuna,1809.72,1811.7
"(1811.7, 1815.04)", or any other public input process?,1811.7,1815.04
"(1815.04, 1816.78)"," Yes, a lot of the feedback we got, sir,",1815.04,1816.78
"(1816.78, 1819.22)"," is something that would not support,",1816.78,1819.22
"(1819.22, 1820.74)", benefit the state of Hawaii.,1819.22,1820.74
"(1820.74, 1822.36)"," That could be from a usage point of view,",1820.74,1822.36
"(1822.36, 1823.94)", an economic point of view.,1822.36,1823.94
"(1823.94, 1825.32)"," As the also the feedback,",1823.94,1825.32
"(1825.32, 1829.16)", it has to be 100% environmental compliance,1825.32,1829.16
"(1829.16, 1830.76)", and protect the environment.,1829.16,1830.76
"(1830.76, 1833.28)"," So those are, I'll say, themes are coming back.",1830.76,1833.28
"(1833.28, 1834.7)"," Yeah, I think that's what we're asking here.",1833.28,1834.7
"(1834.7, 1835.54)"," Yes, sir.",1834.7,1835.54
"(1835.54, 1837.2)"," I think over time, it's a really good question",1835.54,1837.2
"(1837.2, 1838.58)", because what we're talking about,1837.2,1838.58
"(1838.58, 1840.32)"," is what are the criteria as you bring up,",1838.58,1840.32
"(1840.32, 1843.46)"," and then as with any sort of decision of this magnitude,",1840.32,1843.46
"(1843.46, 1845.2)", it's the weighting of each criteria,1843.46,1845.2
"(1845.84, 1852.96)", and so i think this uh this effort to get as much input as possible would get i think in what you're,1845.84,1852.96
"(1852.96, 1859.6)", talking about because while many of these uh these are all important decision-making criteria there,1852.96,1859.6
"(1859.6, 1871.68)"," are some i think that would be reflective of what the public would expect. And so again, we're just in the data collection phase and as we move into later decision making,",1859.6,1871.68
"(1871.68, 1879.0)", I think absolutely these kinds of formalizing the decision criteria will come in.,1871.68,1879.0
"(1879.0, 1884.32)"," If it's as Lieutenant Wanger, Lieutenant Colonel Wanger said, you want to rebuild trust, I",1879.0,1884.32
"(1884.32, 1889.0)", think that there needs to be some transparency about that. The fear of somebody who doesn't trust assumes that maybe it's not their interest as being less prioritized.,1884.32,1889.0
"(1889.0, 1893.0)", It's money or it's something else.,1889.0,1893.0
"(1893.0, 1906.8)"," So if you lay those cards out on the table and we talk about the prioritization, I think it's's uh it's a more transparent and so there'll be a",1893.0,1906.8
"(1906.8, 1913.12)", balance obviously and i think that's uh it'll all be for all to see it is a balance you know as i,1906.8,1913.12
"(1913.12, 1919.92)", think we could appreciate uh it's not it probably won't be formulaic you know if you will but uh,1913.12,1919.92
"(1921.12, 1934.0)", thank you general hashimoto can i ask you who will ultimately make the decision on the reviews?,1921.12,1934.0
"(1934.0, 1948.4)"," This is Donald Panthan. I can see the decision will between the Department of Defense engaging with the State of Hawaii, engaging with the state of hawaii why there'll be a very senior uh meetings going back and forth",1934.0,1948.4
"(1948.4, 1955.36)", of this uh the ones that have merit and that are feasibly uh capable and there'll be some,1948.4,1955.36
"(1955.36, 1959.2)", discussions uh between the department of defense and the state of hawaii to pursue,1955.36,1959.2
"(1959.2, 1967.5)", um an ultimate solution and recommendation is the state state of Hawaii the governor? Is that the state of Hawaii?,1959.2,1967.5
"(1967.5, 1969.76)"," Under ordinary circumstances,",1967.5,1969.76
"(1969.76, 1972.46)"," when we're dealing with an underground storage tank,",1969.76,1972.46
"(1972.46, 1974.26)", it would be the Department of Health.,1972.46,1974.26
"(1975.54, 1977.7)", Obviously the Department of Health would reach out,1975.54,1977.7
"(1977.7, 1982.7)", to other agencies within the state of Hawaii,1977.7,1982.7
"(1983.06, 1986.72)", and have discussions with members of the public as well.,1983.06,1986.72
"(1991.34, 2000.4)", I have two questions maybe for you first following that and then for Mr. Panthen.,1991.34,2000.4
"(2001.6, 2008.6)"," So given that would the process for public input then be through FTECH because DOH, you know,",2001.6,2008.6
"(2008.6, 2016.6)"," doesn't have like C1, a regular open process for helping make that kind of follow-up decision?",2008.6,2016.6
"(2016.6, 2019.6)", Or is there going to be another mechanism?,2016.6,2019.6
"(2019.6, 2031.94)"," You know, we haven't really thought that through yet because we still have to see what is the outcome. But we will be seeking",2019.6,2031.94
"(2032.3, 2039.38)", some public input either through F tack or some some other,2032.3,2039.38
"(2039.48, 2040.24)", reaching out.,2039.48,2040.24
"(2041.36, 2047.28)"," I concur Kathy, you know, we have quarterly meetings to be transparent with the public. Two",2041.36,2047.28
"(2047.28, 2051.6)"," of them a year at the FTAC, the other two of the years with Navy working with the regularity of some",2047.28,2051.6
"(2051.6, 2056.64)", of the public meetings and that as we progress forward that'd be a great topic. Yeah in addition,2051.6,2056.64
"(2058.56, 2069.52)"," there was a settlement a consent order with the federal government, EPA, and the Navy and others.",2058.56,2069.52
"(2069.52, 2074.36)"," And on Thursday, they are going to be convening",2069.52,2074.36
"(2074.36, 2076.32)", their first meeting of...,2074.36,2076.32
"(2078.36, 2079.62)", This is a community-,2078.36,2079.62
"(2079.62, 2082.46)"," Community outreach and engagement involvement, right.",2079.62,2082.46
"(2082.46, 2087.28)", So that's also a good forum to talk about uh the reuse of the,2082.46,2087.28
"(2087.28, 2093.36)", tanks well i have a question before yes sir for the department of health when you say you're you're,2087.28,2093.36
"(2093.36, 2098.48)", going to be the decision maker you really mean the governor right the governor of the legislature,2093.36,2098.48
"(2098.48, 2106.64)"," because this is a political issue i mean i know you're the technical agency, but when you say that, you're not the ultimate",2098.48,2106.64
"(2106.64, 2107.64)", decision.,2106.64,2107.64
"(2107.64, 2111.32)", I would say we would have discussions with everyone about the room.,2107.64,2111.32
"(2111.32, 2114.22)", But I'm asking who makes the final decision.,2111.32,2114.22
"(2114.22, 2115.22)"," It's not DOH, right?",2114.22,2115.22
"(2115.22, 2116.22)", I used to be in DOH.,2115.22,2116.22
"(2116.22, 2117.22)", I understand.,2116.22,2117.22
"(2117.22, 2126.72)", I used to work for you when I was in DOH. And you were my client when you were the director.,2117.22,2126.72
"(2126.72, 2129.18)", So I understand when you understand,2126.72,2129.18
"(2129.18, 2131.88)", the political nature of this.,2129.18,2131.88
"(2131.88, 2132.64)", So yes.,2131.88,2132.64
"(2132.64, 2135.26)"," That's why I asked the question, because it's not",2132.64,2135.26
"(2135.26, 2137.94)", that's going to be DOH dealing with the Department,2135.26,2137.94
"(2137.94, 2143.56)"," of Defense, which is kind of an unequal partnership, which",2137.94,2143.56
"(2143.56, 2144.9)", I accept.,2143.56,2144.9
"(2144.9, 2148.64)", I just want a clarification is that i know politics will be,2144.9,2148.64
"(2148.64, 2155.04)", involved and ultimately i think it's going to be either the governor or i i hope the legislature,2148.64,2155.04
"(2155.04, 2160.56)", doesn't get involved in this you know just complicate it uh but but it's more common,2155.04,2160.56
"(2162.64, 2165.58)", okay but i think that's the value of transparency.,2162.64,2165.58
"(2165.58, 2167.5)", If we give the criteria on the table,2165.58,2167.5
"(2167.5, 2172.24)", and the analysis is applied in an ethical and open way,2167.5,2172.24
"(2172.24, 2174.94)"," to each option, then everybody can see.",2172.24,2174.94
"(2174.94, 2177.64)", And somebody's going to make that call who has the authority.,2174.94,2177.64
"(2177.64, 2183.22)"," But the consequences of the call will be clear,",2177.64,2183.22
"(2183.22, 2186.54)", and there'll be some accountability.,2183.22,2186.54
"(2188.56, 2189.46)"," Well, I think both DOH and the Navy. In a perfect world.",2188.56,2189.46
"(2189.46, 2190.72)", I got you.,2189.46,2190.72
"(2190.72, 2191.86)", Okay.,2190.72,2191.86
"(2191.86, 2194.46)", Will Congress have a role in this,2191.86,2194.46
"(2194.46, 2196.94)", or is that going to ultimately be DOD?,2194.46,2196.94
"(2197.86, 2200.24)"," Do you know, General Hashimoto?",2197.86,2200.24
"(2200.24, 2203.46)", Congress is going to have a role in the decision.,2200.24,2203.46
"(2203.46, 2206.24)"," Ma'am, I'll tell you you i'm unclear on that right now",2203.46,2206.24
"(2206.24, 2210.64)", i think that will be one of the outcomes of the brief to congress in february 2024 so we'll have,2206.24,2210.64
"(2210.64, 2217.68)", to follow up on that at that point in time very good just cost money that's not in a normal budget,2210.64,2217.68
"(2217.68, 2226.88)", wouldn't that money be coming from congress all depends on if you're talking about what is the final solution or recommendation,2217.68,2226.88
"(2226.88, 2232.48)", for benefits any solution would have to be funded any solution it could be a state it could be dod,2226.88,2232.48
"(2232.48, 2237.52)", it could be a corporate so it would have to be funded and so when we come down to that short list,2232.48,2237.52
"(2237.52, 2241.92)", of options um that will have to be taken into consideration at that point in time,2237.52,2241.92
"(2241.92, 2248.88)", because it might be a great option or recommendation but if you can't get funded just i'm making this up right now the 2035 then maybe you might want to,2241.92,2248.88
"(2248.88, 2252.24)", go with a different solution at that point in time but that will be a future product,2248.88,2252.24
"(2254.32, 2258.96)", well i think the navy is getting a real clear message if you can kind of include include this,2254.32,2258.96
"(2259.6, 2266.0)"," on your regular updates to us you know know, just the more transparency, the criteria that Neil",2259.6,2266.0
"(2266.0, 2272.24)", is talking about and process and substance. But I don't think the intention isn't to have,2266.0,2272.24
"(2272.24, 2277.24)"," all the answers today, but clearly we are looking at sort of the bottom line, who makes",2272.24,2277.24
"(2277.24, 2284.24)", the ultimate decision on this very important issue of the reuse of those facilities.,2277.24,2284.24
"(2284.24, 2286.72)", Any other questions aurora,2284.24,2286.72
"(2286.72, 2291.68)", go ahead i just have a second question for mr crumpton which was if you could recap the three,2286.72,2291.68
"(2291.68, 2300.64)", parallel efforts um nash that happening ndaa national defense authorization act um onr has,2291.68,2300.64
"(2300.64, 2306.62)", funded uh i've not heard of that um for non-fossil fuel reuse and then this.,2300.64,2306.62
"(2306.62, 2307.54)", And then Nakapuna.,2306.62,2307.54
"(2307.54, 2308.52)", Nakapuna.,2307.54,2308.52
"(2308.52, 2313.1)"," So given that, I guess, having worked with community,",2308.52,2313.1
"(2313.1, 2316.84)", sometimes the perception can be that people's input,2313.1,2316.84
"(2316.84, 2319.9)", will be considered in its full entirety.,2316.84,2319.9
"(2319.9, 2323.82)", And the reality is that it would be weighted.,2319.9,2323.82
"(2323.82, 2326.0)", Do people who are participating in these,2323.82,2326.0
"(2326.0, 2332.56)", engagements understand that i think some more than others ma'am i i would say uh we collected,2326.0,2332.56
"(2332.56, 2339.36)", uh probably about a thousand just open surveys uh from the website there's another about uh 40,2332.56,2339.36
"(2339.36, 2344.32)", interviews and we're expecting another a couple of thousand from the mail order coming in so you,2339.36,2344.32
"(2344.32, 2347.74)", could have a wide range of recommendations there.,2344.32,2347.74
"(2347.74, 2349.92)"," And other wide range of recommendations,",2347.74,2349.92
"(2349.92, 2351.4)", there's a long going to come down a short list,2349.92,2351.4
"(2351.4, 2353.64)"," of a two, three or four that ultimately get,",2351.4,2353.64
"(2353.64, 2356.04)", have merit and for strong consideration,2353.64,2356.04
"(2356.04, 2356.88)", of the final product.,2356.04,2356.88
"(2356.88, 2358.56)"," So we consider everything,",2356.88,2358.56
"(2358.56, 2360.5)", and this is why it was open for a wide range.,2358.56,2360.5
"(2360.5, 2362.14)"," Not only do we get a lot of recommendations,",2360.5,2362.14
"(2362.14, 2364.32)"," but going back to criteria saying,",2362.14,2364.32
"(2364.32, 2369.04)"," some people say we don't care what it is, as long as it has this criteria in there to make sure the environment",2364.32,2369.04
"(2369.04, 2373.2)", is protected and other things so we're collecting all this data information when the data collection,2369.04,2373.2
"(2373.2, 2378.32)", phase right now so as we synthesize all this information and move forward we will have better,2373.2,2378.32
"(2378.32, 2383.84)", clarity on the next steps but you're right with all these recommendations it's going to be a 99,2378.32,2383.84
"(2383.84, 2385.2)", of the recommendations won't be selected it's going to be a 99 percent of all the recommendations,2383.84,2385.2
"(2385.2, 2391.52)", won't be stuck it's going to be narrowed down to a couple and there are some i'll say recommendations,2385.2,2391.52
"(2391.52, 2399.36)", that are consistent between multiple individuals making their submissions okay so what is the,2391.52,2399.36
"(2399.36, 2404.88)", process we we heard about the process for the selection will be based on certain criteria but,2399.36,2404.88
"(2404.88, 2405.68)", what's the process for shortlisting because based on certain criteria but what's the process,2404.88,2405.68
"(2405.68, 2410.24)", for shortlisting because there's a lot of stuff that can drop out well that's going to go all,2405.68,2410.24
"(2410.24, 2414.96)", this can be consultant okay so that consolidate brief is not coming from here okay all these three,2410.24,2414.96
"(2414.96, 2421.76)", inputs are being fed back into on dc okay dc will be consolidated folks in dc will be consolidated,2414.96,2421.76
"(2421.76, 2426.56)", this report later this year. They're working on criteria,2421.76,2426.56
"(2426.56, 2428.88)", how they're gonna approach that right now.,2426.56,2428.88
"(2428.88, 2431.4)"," I'm not involved in that at this point in time,",2428.88,2431.4
"(2432.32, 2433.52)", but that's what they're gonna be doing,2432.32,2433.52
"(2433.52, 2434.9)", to make the recommendations,2433.52,2434.9
"(2434.9, 2438.34)", to the final brief to Congress in February 24.,2434.9,2438.34
"(2438.34, 2443.16)"," Is there, and is the CRY part of that process in DC",2438.34,2443.16
"(2443.16, 2443.98)", or can it be?,2443.16,2443.98
"(2443.98, 2446.6)", And I'm just asking because in like planning,2443.98,2446.6
"(2446.6, 2450.14)"," and participatory theory, there's rungs of engagement",2446.6,2450.14
"(2450.14, 2452.96)", and consultation is sort of the lowest.,2450.14,2452.96
"(2452.96, 2456.18)", And then like community decision-making is the highest.,2452.96,2456.18
"(2456.18, 2458.64)", And the reality is it's gonna be somewhere in between.,2456.18,2458.64
"(2458.64, 2460.94)"," So is there, you know, in this process,",2458.64,2460.94
"(2460.94, 2463.04)", and it's really important for building trust,2460.94,2463.04
"(2463.04, 2464.14)", to have more than that.,2463.04,2464.14
"(2464.14, 2471.52)", So are you sort of engaging with those those ideas of maybe shifting in order to build trust,2464.14,2471.52
"(2471.52, 2479.6)", the level of um sort of community say and and at least that shortlist so we do greet the community,2471.52,2479.6
"(2479.6, 2486.08)", any scenario open house we go to matter of fact uh we just came up with a new flyer that is i mentioned the,2479.6,2486.08
"(2486.08, 2492.64)", mail survey going out the end of this month it's been targeted to uh zip codes throughout oahu,2486.08,2492.64
"(2493.28, 2498.0)", we have a flyer for that we go to neighborhood boards maybe two or three weeks two or three,2493.28,2498.0
"(2498.0, 2502.48)", per week and we're presenting this in the neighborhood boards as kathy just mentioned,2498.0,2502.48
"(2502.48, 2505.36)", that we have this initiative kicking off this thursday,2502.48,2505.36
"(2505.36, 2512.88)", within cri which is community relations um a team which will be a a small group okay uh,2505.36,2512.88
"(2513.76, 2518.88)", people that are interested in red hill which we'll be talking about the progress towards red hill,2513.76,2518.88
"(2518.88, 2526.48)", overall being environmental tank closure plan and beneficial non-review reuse and they will be maybe meeting twice per quarter,2518.88,2526.48
"(2526.48, 2530.96)", in addition to all the other public meetings or public outreach um so there's a lot of,2526.48,2530.96
"(2530.96, 2535.76)", opportunities we have we do go out and speak to the public about where we're going in the process,2530.96,2535.76
"(2535.76, 2544.0)", and the next steps right but still very well this is broader right now because all these three,2535.76,2544.0
"(2544.0, 2546.0)", efforts are in the data collection phase.,2544.0,2546.0
"(2546.0, 2555.0)"," So until we get all the data in, that will help us narrow down some of the criteria in the next steps of how to synthesize that data, represent it, and present it.",2546.0,2555.0
"(2555.0, 2565.28)"," So it's like almost like a scattergram right now, collecting all the data, and which will inform and help formalize how it's consolidated and sorted.",2555.0,2565.28
"(2566.48, 2573.2)"," Yeah, I guess I'm thinking if just as you move along, considering how much say,",2566.48,2573.2
"(2573.2, 2577.44)", it's probably very different than how Navy normally operates.,2573.2,2577.44
"(2578.44, 2583.8)"," But if the objective is to also build trust, then that feedback needs to come back.",2578.44,2583.8
"(2583.8, 2586.48)", Because if you've taken a lot of people's time to get input,2583.8,2586.48
"(2586.48, 2587.98)"," and then don't take it into account,",2586.48,2587.98
"(2587.98, 2591.08)", that actually puts you in a worse place afterwards,2587.98,2591.08
"(2591.08, 2592.36)", because there's deeper cynicism.,2591.08,2592.36
"(2592.36, 2595.54)"," So I think we'll have more clarity by the fall FTAC 2,",2592.36,2595.54
"(2595.54, 2600.1)", which will be presenting this final brief from Nakapuna,2595.54,2600.1
"(2600.1, 2602.72)", of all their results and hopefully communicate,2600.1,2602.72
"(2602.72, 2610.24)", some of the next steps that we'll follow on after that yeah and so that's hopefully that's one avenue but whatever we do at the uh uh ftac,2602.72,2610.24
"(2610.8, 2614.16)", we have the same material that we use for community boards and other public meetings,2610.8,2614.16
"(2614.72, 2619.04)", in addition to that so people will see it in different places yeah and all this information,2614.72,2619.04
"(2619.04, 2623.92)", i'm speaking of is currently uh with in reference to nakapuna the survey results that we've received,2619.04,2623.92
"(2623.92, 2625.12)", so far uh who,2623.92,2625.12
"(2625.12, 2629.28)", are the people that we interviewed one-on-one yeah uh for the one-on-ones that's all on the,2625.12,2629.28
"(2629.28, 2634.4)", public-facing website right now through that qr code i showed you on the previous slide so all,2629.28,2634.4
"(2634.4, 2639.92)", this is out there available to the public today for what's going on with this effort it does not,2634.4,2639.92
"(2639.92, 2644.32)", elaborate the other two efforts that i told you spoke of because those are independent until they,2639.92,2644.32
"(2644.32, 2650.0)", get completed we'll get the final information for those two and when the final report is publicized,2644.32,2650.0
"(2650.0, 2655.12)", and i guess after the brief to congress that will also be posted here too okay thank you for,2650.0,2655.12
"(2655.12, 2662.56)", explaining this it does help okay thank you yes neil go ahead it strikes me that this briefing,2655.12,2662.56
"(2662.56, 2672.32)", of congress is very important in terms of creating their impression of the status of these of the issues and and uh their background we is that an,2662.56,2672.32
"(2672.32, 2677.6)", independent briefing is it the navy telling its story to congress or will it be reflective of,2672.32,2677.6
"(2677.6, 2682.64)", department of health and state interests sure i'll get you more information on exactly who's going to,2677.6,2682.64
"(2682.64, 2685.12)", be presenting the brief itself but it's going to be presenting the brief itself,2682.64,2685.12
"(2685.12, 2689.2)", but it's going to be input from those three uh independent efforts going on right now,2685.12,2689.2
"(2689.2, 2693.92)", so it's not going to be uh navy's or a point of view it's going to be the collective point of,2689.2,2693.92
"(2693.92, 2697.76)", view of all the input we received and recommendations that we received regardless of,2693.92,2697.76
"(2697.76, 2705.28)", the source of that so unless you're going to have a representative team presenting to congress there probably should be a process,2697.76,2705.28
"(2705.84, 2712.16)", to see what you're going to say so that doh and sea worm and other door to water supply can look,2705.84,2712.16
"(2712.16, 2718.96)", at it and say yep that's you got it that's what's going on here uh so we all feel like and congress,2712.16,2718.96
"(2718.96, 2725.88)"," has been given an accurate uh view of all the parties so So are you saying, in other words, sorry, Chair Chang.",2718.96,2725.88
"(2725.88, 2727.26)"," No, go ahead, Kathleen.",2725.88,2727.26
"(2727.26, 2732.1)"," In other words, are you suggesting that they present us",2727.26,2732.1
"(2732.1, 2735.66)", the findings prior to the report,2732.1,2735.66
"(2735.66, 2737.72)", so we would have comment on it?,2735.66,2737.72
"(2737.72, 2740.82)"," I'm not sure who summoned how this briefing occurs,",2737.72,2740.82
"(2740.82, 2744.26)"," whether anybody can jump on the agenda,",2740.82,2744.26
"(2744.26, 2747.24)"," but if we're not on the agenda, if it's just the Navy, then I think some prior, before that occurs, whether anybody can jump on the agenda. But if we're not on the agenda, if it's just the Navy,",2744.26,2747.24
"(2747.24, 2749.76)"," then I think some prior, before that occurs,",2747.24,2749.76
"(2749.76, 2754.24)", some prior discussion with these parties and stakeholders,2749.76,2754.24
"(2754.24, 2757.34)"," would be healthy, if not required,",2754.24,2757.34
"(2757.34, 2760.0)", at least be healthy and transparent so that we,2757.34,2760.0
"(2760.0, 2764.84)"," understand, yep, you've got our position accurately captured.",2760.0,2764.84
"(2764.84, 2765.24)"," OK, sir. I'll write accurately captured. Okay, sir.",2764.84,2765.24
"(2765.5, 2769.06)", I already doubt action item for myself. I don't think I don't,2765.5,2769.06
"(2769.06, 2773.62)", have an answer for that right now. I sleep. I don't think we're,2769.06,2773.62
"(2773.62, 2776.66)", going to brief the Congress is going to be released intact,2773.62,2776.66
"(2776.72, 2779.9)"," before it goes to Congress. Okay, but I think discussions",2776.72,2779.9
"(2779.9, 2781.66)", could probably take place prior to that.,2779.9,2781.66
"(2783.52, 2785.6)"," General Hashimoto, I think we agreed",2783.52,2785.6
"(2785.6, 2786.94)", on like quarterly updates.,2785.6,2786.94
"(2786.94, 2788.7)", So this is July.,2786.94,2788.7
"(2788.7, 2792.34)"," I think the next update would be very close to your,",2788.7,2792.34
"(2792.34, 2794.72)", I guess it's October?,2792.34,2794.72
"(2795.66, 2799.18)"," October, July, September.",2795.66,2799.18
"(2799.18, 2800.02)"," Yeah, maybe October.",2799.18,2800.02
"(2800.02, 2802.66)"," We'll come back with whatever frequency you require,",2800.02,2802.66
"(2802.66, 2803.48)", Chair Chang.,2802.66,2803.48
"(2803.48, 2812.98)"," Okay, yeah, I think we were looking at quarterly updates, so maybe the next one would be back in October, and hopefully you'll have some greater updates.",2803.48,2812.98
"(2814.06, 2821.84)"," I was also hoping, you know, I think you're getting sort of an inclination from this commission about the desire to be transparent.",2814.06,2821.84
"(2821.84, 2825.28)"," I've greatly appreciated the updates you've provided us,",2821.84,2825.28
"(2831.04, 2831.52)"," you know, sort of the candor in your process. It is so much better when you say, if you don't know,",2831.04,2831.52
"(2835.68, 2835.82)"," don't, you know, don't make up something, but that you'll come back to us. So again, we hope,",2835.68,2835.82
"(2842.5, 2848.1)"," you know, please come back to us. But in the desire for transparency, I am hoping that after the report on your findings in the outreach, that report is broadly",2842.5,2848.1
"(2848.1, 2854.34)", distributed to everyone who participated and more so that they have an opportunity to provide,2848.1,2854.34
"(2854.34, 2857.5)", you comments on the report as well.,2854.34,2857.5
"(2857.5, 2868.58)", I think in the past we have had other very important issues where we've had minority reports that go up that the report is you know,2857.5,2868.58
"(2868.58, 2874.96)", reflects the authors and it may be a majority report there may be something there's an,2868.58,2874.96
"(2874.96, 2882.66)", opportunity for someone who a group or you know entities who disagree to submit at least at least,2874.96,2882.66
"(2882.66, 2887.0)", where there's additional comments or minority port report.,2882.66,2887.0
"(2887.0, 2896.0)"," But please think about that as a way to continue ongoing transparency as providing us another opportunity, us being the community.",2887.0,2896.0
"(2896.0, 2909.36)", Another opportunity to weigh in on the report that it does reflect the communities's both process and substance yes dan and what i can promise you,2896.0,2909.36
"(2909.36, 2914.4)", is when nakapuna's report is final we'll have a press release announcing that it's final along,2909.36,2914.4
"(2914.4, 2919.36)", with the website was publicly posted also there will be an email address if anybody has any,2914.4,2919.36
"(2919.36, 2923.52)", question for information on my clarity or follow-up any point i will take all those uh,2919.36,2923.52
"(2924.56, 2926.42)", all those requests and I,2924.56,2926.42
"(2926.42, 2930.62)", will respond to them and all the responses to anybody's questions I will also post on the,2926.42,2930.62
"(2930.62, 2937.58)", public website for everybody's information so I can give them excellent thank you yes Larry,2930.62,2937.58
"(2937.58, 2947.6)", oh since I'm new to this process um this kind of briefing where else have you been giving this to the reason i ask is that um,2937.58,2947.6
"(2948.24, 2954.8)", the questions from the commissioners are like we want to be able to disseminate the information to,2948.24,2954.8
"(2954.8, 2961.44)", as many people as possible but i want to know is is this commission the proper one or the one,2954.8,2961.44
"(2961.44, 2965.2)", that's been doing this or is there other places that you've been i'll take that,2961.44,2965.2
"(2965.2, 2969.84)", uh there have been multiple venues where this team has presented information you've already,2965.2,2969.84
"(2969.84, 2974.48)", heard about the attack that's pretty well known there's a house special committee on red hill,2969.84,2974.48
"(2974.48, 2982.4)", there's a governor's uh commission on water and there's also uh defueling specific defueling,2974.48,2982.4
"(2982.4, 2986.16)", information sharing forum as well as the uh all of the,2982.4,2986.16
"(2986.16, 2992.56)", organizations have public facing websites and the ability to interact uh at any time okay i,2986.16,2992.56
"(2992.56, 2998.24)", appreciate that because my impression was the questions were being asked by the commissioners,2992.56,2998.24
"(2998.24, 3005.38)", as uh as the as like you guys got to go out there and do more. I just want to know if this is the main forum,2998.24,3005.38
"(3005.38, 3006.72)", or do you have many forums?,3005.38,3006.72
"(3006.72, 3009.3)", I'd say it's one of many that is attended,3006.72,3009.3
"(3009.3, 3013.1)", by many of the commissioners here that have been on.,3009.3,3013.1
"(3013.1, 3014.54)", I couldn't respond though.,3013.1,3014.54
"(3014.54, 3017.1)"," I mean, part of the feedback that we've gotten loud",3014.54,3017.1
"(3017.1, 3019.94)", and clear and regularly from the public.,3017.1,3019.94
"(3019.94, 3023.06)", I have a hard time understanding what you're saying.,3019.94,3023.06
"(3023.06, 3027.28)", I have small kids who have germs so um um so a lot of,3023.06,3027.28
"(3027.28, 3031.6)", the feedback that we have gotten from the public from day one has been that the commission's,3027.28,3031.6
"(3032.48, 3040.16)", regular open meetings have provided an important forum for exchange and questions at a time that,3032.48,3040.16
"(3040.16, 3046.24)", um there wasn't all of this public kind of facing organized communications.,3040.16,3046.24
"(3046.24, 3054.84)"," So we still get, you know, sort of that push from those who provide testimony to ensure",3046.24,3054.84
"(3054.84, 3057.62)", that that transparency happens.,3054.84,3057.62
"(3057.62, 3062.24)", So it's good that it's happening through other forums now and with more regularity.,3057.62,3062.24
"(3062.24, 3063.24)", Thank you.,3062.24,3063.24
"(3063.24, 3067.84)"," And Larry, if I can just add to aurora's comments it was really i mean",3063.24,3067.84
"(3068.48, 3073.84)", i have since i've come on board as chair tried to use both the water commission and the land board,3068.48,3073.84
"(3074.4, 3080.48)", as an opportunity for a public forum because we are one of the few agencies that actually open,3074.4,3080.48
"(3080.48, 3086.42)", our meetings to the public it was designed to create a safe space,3080.48,3086.42
"(3086.42, 3088.7)"," for informed decision-making,",3086.42,3088.7
"(3088.7, 3092.22)"," permitting issues before they are controversial,",3088.7,3092.22
"(3092.22, 3094.6)"," including the Navy, an opportunity.",3092.22,3094.6
"(3094.6, 3097.66)", And General Hashimoto has been extremely cooperative,3094.6,3097.66
"(3097.66, 3098.74)", and willing to do that.,3097.66,3098.74
"(3098.74, 3102.88)"," So it is, and we've asked for a comprehensive update,",3098.74,3102.88
"(3102.88, 3107.0)"," not just on defueling, but on all of the aspects.",3102.88,3107.0
"(3107.0, 3126.4)"," So I think the intention for sea worm was, while some of these things may be out of our regulatory lane, it is nonetheless a public platform that the community can look both at our minutes and review our transcripts and can also participate in our process through either",3107.0,3126.4
"(3126.4, 3133.46)"," YouTubing or coming and providing comments. So that's kind of the, you know, the impetus of this.",3126.4,3133.46
"(3133.46, 3141.02)", But I do know that the Navy has been having numerous meetings. I don't know how coordinated,3133.46,3141.02
"(3141.02, 3145.6)"," everyone is, but this has been just our platform to create another space",3141.02,3145.6
"(3145.6, 3153.12)", for good information before decisions are being made okay i'm glad about that clarification,3145.6,3153.12
"(3153.12, 3160.24)", because what i'm looking at is that we are the water commission and my focus is on water issues,3153.12,3160.24
"(3160.24, 3166.88)", yeah and so i i don't want to get into a ride ranging things where we're we're basically,3160.24,3166.88
"(3166.88, 3172.96)", looking at stuff that we shouldn't be looking at um but as long as they want to be uh willing,3166.88,3172.96
"(3172.96, 3178.16)", to provide information to us and as long as some of the commissioners think it's important that we,3172.96,3178.16
"(3178.16, 3186.4)", be the conduit for the public i'm fine with that but i want want to remind everybody that we're at a water commission.,3178.16,3186.4
"(3188.82, 3208.16)"," Appreciate that reminder, Larry. I think that the commission is clear what our role is, but I think we also, many members of the commission, hear public comments, and General Hashimoto and his team has been willing to utilize our meeting as as an opportunity for good accurate current information",3188.82,3208.16
"(3208.16, 3214.24)", on a regular basis also i think i'd be remiss if i didn't add the open houses that these,3208.16,3214.24
"(3214.24, 3219.28)", organizations hold as well as using the city and county's neighborhood board system uh to get the,3214.24,3219.28
"(3219.28, 3226.1)", information out and i would like to say uh as valuable as it's been for us to be able to push information,3219.28,3226.1
"(3226.1, 3232.58)"," to the public and the Commission via this meeting, I can speak for everyone here today.",3226.1,3232.58
"(3232.58, 3238.16)", The insights that we have gained from your comments have been invaluable.,3232.58,3238.16
"(3238.16, 3244.06)"," And so making sure we meet the accuracy and completion standards, we wouldn't have that",3238.16,3244.06
"(3244.06, 3246.0)", without that kind of interaction.,3244.06,3246.0
"(3246.0, 3252.0)"," So i'll for your input. Okay, great any other questions and Jenna Hashimoto.",3246.0,3252.0

"(3279.28, 3285.84)", specifically i would like to speak to you today about water quality and efforts the navy continues to do to ensure,3279.28,3285.84

"(3324.12, 3325.36)", as well as to build public,3324.12,3325.36
"(3325.36, 3330.08)", confidence in the drinking water system by creating an avenue which we were consistently,3325.36,3330.08
"(3330.08, 3334.96)", collecting data and posting it publicly and interacting with residents in the community,3330.08,3334.96
"(3334.96, 3341.76)", to continue to show that the drinking water is safe so so far we have collected 6 300 samples of,3334.96,3341.76

"(3348.36, 3352.86)", And we also have several locations where we continue to collect samples on a periodic,3348.36,3352.86

"(3368.56, 3373.68)", that the water is safe especially for communities for at-risk populations such as our cake so um,3368.56,3373.68
"(3374.24, 3380.16)", all that data is posted online and it continues to be shared we continue to see that the water,3374.24,3380.16

"(3418.16, 3424.08)", source right now for the drinking water system for pfas to guarantee that we don't have pfas in our,3418.16,3424.08
"(3424.08, 3425.6)", drinking water and to guarantee that's not't have PFAS in our drinking water and to guarantee,3424.08,3425.6
"(3425.6, 3428.88)", that's not an area of concern for our drinking water constituents.,3425.6,3428.88
"(3428.88, 3431.16)", And so that result was non-detect.,3428.88,3431.16
"(3431.16, 3435.48)", We were able to verify that the drinking water is non-detect for PFAS.,3431.16,3435.48
"(3435.48, 3440.6)", We also continue to make sure we're sharing our data in a variety of avenues.,3435.48,3440.6
"(3440.6, 3445.54)"," So we've created a website called Safe Waters, which is a sharing website that",3440.6,3445.54
"(3445.54, 3451.54)", the Navy has utilized to make available the data to all members of our community.,3445.54,3451.54
"(3451.54, 3454.66)", So we are able to share the data in a variety of avenues.,3451.54,3454.66
"(3454.66, 3459.78)"," We have data reports or files, so the actual laboratory reports from the files shared in",3454.66,3459.78
"(3459.78, 3461.0)", a library.,3459.78,3461.0
"(3461.0, 3474.0)"," We have data summary reports at the end of each period to be able to attempt to better explain the data that residents in the community are looking at, help them explain what that means to them and how it's relevant.",3461.0,3474.0
"(3474.0, 3485.44)"," And then we also have an interactive map, which allows residents or business owners or community members to look up an address and be able to see the data history from that specific",3474.0,3485.44
"(3485.44, 3490.56)", location and some of the feedback we've heard specifically is to make things like school names,3485.44,3490.56
"(3490.56, 3495.92)", easy to search so that a parent that has a student in school can easily look up that school name and,3490.56,3495.92
"(3495.92, 3500.32)", identify what what the safety of the water at their child's school is and things of that nature,3495.92,3500.32
"(3501.2, 3506.16)", so in addition to these efforts we also wanted to continue to promote the public outreach,3501.2,3506.16
"(3506.16, 3512.48)", the community outreach so we've been setting up booths and uh things like the the naval exchange,3506.16,3512.48
"(3512.48, 3518.4)", facility and the lobby area which is open to the public uh for people to interact with what,3512.48,3518.4
"(3518.4, 3525.84)"," drinking water experts be able to look up their results, ask questions, find out more information about the work that we're doing.",3518.4,3525.84
"(3525.84, 3528.4)"," We also are working with our schools,",3525.84,3528.4
"(3528.4, 3532.02)", hoping this fall to set up those similar booths,3528.4,3532.02
"(3532.02, 3534.74)", at maybe some back to school events or open houses,3532.02,3534.74
"(3534.74, 3538.2)", so that parents of students help build confidence,3534.74,3538.2
"(3538.2, 3539.84)"," in the drinking water for their children,",3538.2,3539.84

"(3541.42, 3543.12)", and get information about the water.,3541.42,3543.12
"(3543.12, 3546.72)", So those are just some of the efforts that we're doing to continue to show,3543.12,3546.72
"(3546.72, 3551.16)", the water is safe and to also basically hold to our commitment,3546.72,3551.16
"(3551.16, 3553.2)", that we were going to continue to sample the water.,3551.16,3553.2
"(3554.24, 3557.32)"," In addition to all the efforts we're doing here,",3554.24,3557.32
"(3557.44, 3562.2)", we continue to pursue sampling at the Navy IAO Halawa shaft.,3557.44,3562.2
"(3562.6, 3564.88)", It is our current shaft that is offline.,3562.6,3564.88
"(3564.88, 3568.14)", It's been offline since December 3rd of 2021.,3564.88,3568.14
"(3568.14, 3572.48)"," However, we felt it was important to build data history",3568.14,3572.48
"(3572.48, 3573.96)", for that location.,3572.48,3573.96
"(3573.96, 3576.32)"," And so starting September of 2022,",3573.96,3576.32
"(3576.32, 3580.26)", we began doing every two to three weeks of flushing,3576.32,3580.26
"(3580.26, 3583.04)", to overland for about 15 to 20 minutes,3580.26,3583.04
"(3583.04, 3585.92)", for the purpose of collecting samples from that location,3583.04,3585.92
"(3585.92, 3591.28)", to build data history so that we could see uh what the water quality is like in that location,3585.92,3591.28
"(3592.16, 3597.92)", for future discussions with our regulators about reuse of that location so that's just some of the,3592.16,3597.92
"(3597.92, 3602.16)", things we're doing in regards to our drinking water and captain sullivan will share more about,3597.92,3602.16
"(3602.16, 3609.36)", our remediation efforts and other environmental and if I could also on this same topic that we do have as Sarah mentioned all of the,3602.16,3609.36
"(3609.36, 3615.44)", testing going on we also have a retina response team that is available if any resident has a,3609.36,3615.44
"(3615.44, 3620.08)", concern about their water quality if they're seeing anything unusual they can call over to,3615.44,3620.08
"(3620.08, 3625.28)", our emergency operations center and then we'll dispatch a team to go look at the quality as well,3620.08,3625.28
"(3625.28, 3630.4)", as take samples for an initial sample and then we'll add them to make sure their location gets,3625.28,3630.4
"(3630.4, 3635.04)", included within the period within the next few days for the long-term monitoring so that we can,3630.4,3635.04
"(3635.04, 3643.28)", get those results so that remains in place all times yeah these this these are your tactics uh,3635.04,3643.28
"(3643.28, 3646.4)", what indicators are you uh using to determine whether your tactics. What indicators are you using to determine,3643.28,3646.4
"(3646.4, 3648.8)", whether your tactics are successful?,3646.4,3648.8
"(3648.8, 3651.62)", That the public feels a sense of high confidence,3648.8,3651.62
"(3651.62, 3653.36)", in drinking that water.,3651.62,3653.36
"(3654.52, 3658.82)", So that's a challenging data point to track.,3654.52,3658.82
"(3658.82, 3662.7)", Obviously we'll continue to take feedback from community,3658.82,3662.7
"(3662.7, 3663.88)"," if they're drinking bottled water,",3662.7,3663.88
"(3663.88, 3665.52)", if they're not using their water for not using their water,3663.88,3665.52
"(3670.64, 3676.16)", is that something where we can have conversations actually go into their home and look at the water in their home and see if there's specific issues that can be addressed um we have seen a distinct,3670.64,3676.16
"(3676.16, 3681.84)", down down shift in reports and calls of concerns and things like that over the last six months or,3676.16,3681.84
"(3681.84, 3685.52)", so and so we hope that's indicative that people are starting to,3681.84,3685.52
"(3685.52, 3691.2)", have confidence in their water again um but the challenge with public trust is that's a hard thing,3685.52,3691.2
"(3691.2, 3698.24)", to quantify and so all we can continue to do is to act to show sustained that we continue to hold to,3691.2,3698.24
"(3698.24, 3702.96)", our word but uh the best reports and the gauge i have is my interactions with the community,3698.24,3702.96
"(3703.6, 3708.48)", and if i could add to that at a lot of these town hall events and our booths at different locations,3703.6,3708.48
"(3708.48, 3714.24)", we will have individuals that come up very concerned very emotional at times and take the,3708.48,3714.24
"(3714.24, 3719.12)", time we walk through we explain the results we answer all the questions and most of those,3714.24,3719.12
"(3719.12, 3726.0)", interactions do leave with that individual feeling like they got their questions answered and at least understanding,3719.12,3726.0
"(3726.0, 3733.12)", you know sometimes sometimes we can't pull back and restore that full trust but we at least by,3726.0,3733.12
"(3733.12, 3739.68)", the the mood by the way those interactions go and what might start as a very tense interaction um,3733.12,3739.68
"(3740.72, 3752.0)"," we do our best and receive indications that when that individual finally does leave the table, the booth, and the discussion, they seem to be satisfied and understanding what we're doing.",3740.72,3752.0
"(3752.0, 3768.96)"," As imperfect as any measure might be, I think making an effort to just kind of identify some things that you're tracking and seeing the delta over time, I think would be beneficial healthy yeah so with what frequency are you um",3752.0,3768.96
"(3769.52, 3775.6)", is this is the questions we get so with what frequency is the navy testing for pfas,3769.52,3775.6
"(3777.2, 3789.6)"," so currently we have tested the yabba shaft a single time under the UCMR5, the basically unregulated contaminants program under the EPA.",3777.2,3789.6
"(3789.78, 3793.68)"," And so we will collect another sample this fall,",3789.78,3793.68
"(3793.68, 3796.36)", seven months after that sample to verify that.,3793.68,3796.36
"(3796.36, 3798.24)", We do not currently sample for PFAS,3796.36,3798.24
"(3798.24, 3799.88)"," within the distribution system,",3798.24,3799.88
"(3799.88, 3803.32)", just because of the sensitivity of that testing procedure,3799.88,3803.32
"(3803.32, 3805.38)", and the risk of cross-contamination,3803.32,3805.38
"(3805.38, 3809.04)", because PFAS is so prevalent in all sorts of things,3805.38,3809.04
"(3809.04, 3813.06)"," in our community, popcorn packaging and Teflon pans",3809.04,3813.06
"(3813.06, 3813.9)", and things like that.,3813.06,3813.9
"(3813.9, 3817.02)"," So we've prioritized those efforts on the sources,",3813.9,3817.02
"(3817.02, 3819.7)", both the Navy IAEA of La La Shep has been tested,3817.02,3819.7
"(3819.7, 3821.16)", as well as the La La Shep.,3819.7,3821.16
"(3822.54, 3823.68)", I have a follow-up then.,3822.54,3823.68
"(3823.68, 3826.8)"," So by that token, you are using epa what",3823.68,3826.8
"(3826.8, 3833.04)", is it method what methods are you are being used sorry so there are two separate method groups for,3826.8,3833.04
"(3833.04, 3840.48)", pfas yeah we for the lava shaft and the navy idea hall of shaft we use method 537.1 and 533 which,3833.04,3840.48
"(3840.48, 3846.46)"," are the epa drinking water methods for other p PFAS efforts that we've done in the area,",3840.48,3846.46
"(3846.46, 3850.16)"," such as following the AFFF release or at the Red Hill Shack,",3846.46,3850.16
"(3850.16, 3852.94)"," we use method 1633, which is the method",3850.16,3852.94
"(3852.94, 3855.52)", that's been identified for environmental sampling.,3852.94,3855.52
"(3856.6, 3858.5)", And to follow on to Kathy's question,3856.6,3858.5
"(3858.5, 3860.24)"," on for the PFAS sampling,",3858.5,3860.24
"(3860.24, 3863.8)", we do continue to monitor and sample,3860.24,3863.8
"(3863.8, 3866.44)", for the groundwater monitoring wells in the,3863.8,3866.44
"(3866.44, 3869.74)", vicinity of the AFFF release in November of 22.,3866.44,3869.74
"(3869.74, 3871.34)", So those are collected.,3869.74,3871.34
"(3871.34, 3876.9)"," It was weekly for the first six months after the release, and it is now to monthly testing",3871.34,3876.9
"(3876.9, 3880.76)", of those monitor wells in that vicinity for PFS.,3876.9,3880.76
"(3880.76, 3889.98)"," I'm sorry, I asked because we know that those methods are limited to a certain set of known",3880.76,3889.98
"(3889.98, 3896.92)"," and regulated or not regulated, but like, you know, a subset of the possible substances",3889.98,3896.92
"(3896.92, 3898.42)", that can occur.,3896.92,3898.42
"(3898.42, 3906.16)"," And so I guess, are you considering, that's a silly question but you know are there other methods that are",3898.42,3906.16
"(3906.16, 3913.6)", coming online that are not regulatory or not i guess um epa approved yet such as aof or tof that,3906.16,3913.6
"(3913.6, 3917.6)", really look at like the full you know you might have a contaminant event and then it breaks down,3913.6,3917.6
"(3917.6, 3926.96)", into other compounds that are still potentially harmful but um i and i'm saying this for the public too like that our knowledge of how,3917.6,3926.96
"(3926.96, 3932.64)", to regulate and monitor pre-fast is evolving but what are you guys doing to think about how,3926.96,3932.64
"(3932.64, 3940.16)", to protect um public health given um the potential uh for contamination absolutely,3932.64,3940.16
"(3940.96, 3946.76)", so we continue to work with the regulators to sample whatever methods are kind of referred,3940.96,3946.76
"(3946.76, 3949.16)", and asked of us from the regulators.,3946.76,3949.16
"(3949.16, 3952.06)", 1633 did expand to 40 different PFAS analytes.,3949.16,3952.06
"(3952.06, 3954.56)", So it is a more expansive comprehensive look.,3952.06,3954.56
"(3954.56, 3957.12)", It has lower detection levels.,3954.56,3957.12
"(3957.12, 3967.58)"," And 537.1 and 533 combined give us a pretty complete picture of the primary group of PFAS. And also, under long-term",3957.12,3967.58
"(3967.58, 3974.2)"," monitoring, we're collecting for 60-plus analytes of all sorts of other constituents, such as",3967.58,3974.2
"(3974.2, 3980.4)", volatile organic compounds and semi-volatile organic compounds and anything related to total,3974.2,3980.4
"(3980.4, 3985.2)", petroleum hydrocarbons. So we were already doing a pretty comprehensive sampling program,3980.4,3985.2
"(3985.2, 3992.56)", this is just adding those 40 pfas constituents in addition to that sampling and that frequency,3985.2,3992.56
"(3992.56, 3999.44)", part of yava will be moving forward so yava is sampled every period our sources are sampled at,3992.56,3999.44
"(3999.44, 4005.84)", the beginning of every period of long-term monitoring so we do a threat so there's seven periods in the plan,3999.44,4005.84
"(4006.48, 4011.76)", so we do a kind of a baseline sample to make sure we're re-verifying that our source water,4006.48,4011.76
"(4011.76, 4016.64)", is meeting safe drinking water standards and then we move forward through that period so,4011.76,4016.64
"(4017.44, 4022.56)", we continue to sample the way out of a shaft and we're committed throughout the defueling process,4017.44,4022.56
"(4022.56, 4025.52)", to be mindful of public trust in the community and,4022.56,4025.52
"(4025.52, 4029.84)", needed to take a sample from the way out of a shack to continue to verify to the public that,4025.52,4029.84
"(4029.84, 4036.56)", the water remains safe to drink because that location is six miles from right right okay,4029.84,4036.56

"(4169.76, 4172.88)", and make sure we're hearing what his perspective is,4169.76,4172.88
"(4172.88, 4176.96)", so that it could influence our decision and our way forward.,4172.88,4176.96
"(4176.96, 4179.68)", So while I don't intend to go in great detail,4176.96,4179.68
"(4179.68, 4181.08)"," into everything on this slide,",4179.68,4181.08
"(4181.08, 4183.08)"," and this is what is posted on our website,",4181.08,4183.08
"(4183.08, 4189.44)", and this is really the tool that I utilize every time i'm briefing in one of these major forums but i did want to,4183.08,4189.44
"(4189.44, 4193.76)", call out a few key efforts that i know have been part of the discussions within this committee in,4189.44,4193.76
"(4193.76, 4199.52)", the past and are very important to our continued success in the remediation of red hill so moving,4193.76,4199.52
"(4199.52, 4206.56)", down to the first section is the monitoring and sampling effort that the first few blue and the bars below,4199.52,4206.56
"(4206.56, 4211.92)", it those are all related to our continued sampling to make sure we know what's going on in the soil,4206.56,4211.92
"(4211.92, 4217.84)", but also below the soil all around red hill the key area there is the monitoring well expansion,4211.92,4217.84
"(4217.84, 4223.12)", we've committed to 22 additional monitoring wells this year we're making great progress on that,4217.84,4223.12
"(4223.12, 4230.46)"," we've already got 10 complete there are four in progress. Still have eight remaining. We also, on that effort, there",4223.12,4230.46
"(4230.46, 4236.82)"," will be another discussion in October with all of those SMEs, again, members from this",4230.46,4236.82
"(4236.82, 4243.48)"," commission, but also with DOH, EPA, and Board of Water Supply to talk about monitoring well",4236.82,4243.48
"(4243.48, 4245.68)", locations that we currently are not proceeding,4243.48,4245.68
"(4245.68, 4250.8)", with do we need to adjust where we're putting those uh to make sure we fully understand what,4245.68,4250.8
"(4250.8, 4257.36)", what the water is underneath and the aqua parade is doing um captain excuse me oh captain could you,4250.8,4257.36
"(4257.92, 4269.04)", sorry what's an sme i'm not a subject matter expert okay okay sorry sorry sorry sorry go ahead uh so one of while it's much,4257.92,4269.04
"(4269.04, 4273.92)", lower on the slide deck here but what are we utilizing the data that we're getting for the,4269.04,4273.92
"(4273.92, 4279.28)", monitoring wells it is to also make sure and conduct modeling so there are two parallel,4273.92,4279.28
"(4279.28, 4284.4)", modeling efforts that we're proceeding with we have both the navy modeling effort where we're,4279.28,4284.4
"(4284.4, 4286.04)", working with one of our contractors,4284.4,4286.04
"(4286.04, 4287.68)", and have been for several years.,4286.04,4287.68
"(4287.68, 4289.4)", And then there is an independent,4287.68,4289.4
"(4289.4, 4292.0)", University of Hawaii modeling effort,4289.4,4292.0
"(4292.0, 4293.78)"," that we are supporting, giving them,",4292.0,4293.78
"(4293.78, 4296.34)"," make sure they have all of our data, any access,",4293.78,4296.34
"(4296.34, 4298.54)", and helping them in any way we can.,4296.34,4298.54
"(4298.54, 4300.18)", But that is a parallel modeling effort,4298.54,4300.18
"(4300.18, 4302.4)"," the University of Hawaii is doing to, again,",4300.18,4302.4
"(4302.4, 4311.84)", make sure we understand what's happening below the surface where is the groundwater flowing another item i would like to talk about is you know we mentioned,4302.4,4311.84
"(4311.84, 4316.72)", i think at the last c1 there was some discussion on what are your current actions the soil vapor,4311.84,4316.72
"(4316.72, 4321.6)", extraction is a technology that we are proceeding with right now to where we're getting the the,4316.72,4321.6
"(4321.6, 4326.7)", tunnel and the in the attic close to where um the nove the tunnel and the attic close to where the November 20 release,4321.6,4326.7
"(4326.7, 4332.38)", occurred and close to the Red Hill shaft preparing getting the holes that we need and the equipment,4326.7,4332.38
"(4332.38, 4336.92)", we need to do the soil vapor extraction where this is basically we're pushing air we've,4332.38,4336.92
"(4336.92, 4342.56)", identified locations below this surface of the tunnel all the way to the top of the aquifer,4336.92,4342.56
"(4342.56, 4350.24)", where we believe there may be fuel that's trapped within those those layers that's where we'll be pushing in air and pulling back air out,4342.56,4350.24
"(4350.24, 4355.84)", there touching that air out to try and pull all of that fuel that might remain anywhere trapped,4350.24,4355.84
"(4355.84, 4361.04)", within the soil so that effort is currently in progress we're getting the equipment ready we're,4355.84,4361.04
"(4361.04, 4365.04)", getting everything we read need ready to uh to proceed with that,4361.04,4365.04
"(4365.04, 4370.0)", we also have to be very careful that none of the efforts that we're doing now we are not going to,4365.04,4370.0
"(4370.0, 4376.24)", do anything that could in any way slow down or impact the fueling operations so it is a little,4370.0,4376.24
"(4376.24, 4380.72)", bit there are some pauses at times and there's a lot of working with the doh where we know a lot,4376.24,4380.72
"(4380.72, 4385.28)", of people on their team that would be a reviewing and are working with this on,4380.72,4385.28
"(4385.28, 4390.8)", these plans are also the same reviewers that are working on all of the defueling so a little bit,4385.28,4390.8
"(4390.8, 4395.68)", of patience not moving as quickly as we would like but still an effort that we are fully pushing,4390.8,4395.68
"(4395.68, 4405.0)", forward with um okay um quick one while you're in monitoring.,4395.68,4405.0
"(4405.0, 4411.0)", So is the data from this new monitoring wells on the groundwater sampling?,4405.0,4411.0
"(4411.0, 4421.0)"," Yes, ma'am. And so one thing of note, just like Sarah had talked about the Safe Waters website, where we have interactive maps, all of the results are posted.",4411.0,4421.0
"(4421.0, 4425.12)"," We have developed a parallel site which is focused, we have one on drinking water, our distribution system, and then we have developed a parallel site which is focused we have one on",4421.0,4425.12
"(4425.12, 4430.96)", drinking water our distribution system and then we have developed a similar site on all of the,4425.12,4430.96
"(4430.96, 4436.56)", environmental the groundwater samples any soil samples and that is and that's where this,4430.96,4436.56
"(4436.56, 4443.6)", remediation table is all on the environmental half we have an interactive map on that one as well,4436.56,4443.6
"(4443.6, 4446.24)", where you can click on any monitoring well,4443.6,4446.24
"(4446.24, 4451.36)", that's in the network and you can find out what the results were for that monitoring well but we,4446.24,4451.36
"(4451.36, 4455.84)", also have all of the full detailed lab reports and everything posted on that site as well and that,4451.36,4455.84
"(4455.84, 4461.2)", was one of the things that we worked very closely with ernie lao and the team to make sure that he,4455.84,4461.2
"(4461.2, 4466.88)", had access to all of the results and everything that was required us and we continue to,4461.2,4466.88
"(4466.88, 4473.2)", every day improve the quality of that site and the user-friendly testing thank you um,4466.88,4473.2
"(4474.16, 4480.0)", with regard to this monitoring and sampling uh you're continuing to run the pumps and put the,4474.16,4480.0
"(4480.0, 4485.52)", water into yava stream and there's been public concern about the effects of that water,4480.0,4485.52
"(4485.52, 4492.0)", uh on the surface the surface water system itself as well as the life that's dependent upon it is,4485.52,4492.0
"(4492.0, 4497.28)", that captured in the monitoring it's in in the monitoring but also uh one of the efforts that,4492.0,4497.28
"(4497.28, 4500.8)", we that i was going to talk about here in just a moment was about halfway down the slide under,4497.28,4500.8
"(4500.8, 4505.04)", the added three remediation efforts the second the first and second bullet,4500.8,4505.04
"(4505.04, 4509.2)", talk about the capture zone that we're maintaining within the red hill shaft where we're pulling any,4505.04,4509.2
"(4509.2, 4514.72)", contamination that might be in the aquifer uh towards the pumps so that we can collect them,4509.2,4514.72
"(4515.36, 4520.8)", if you go back to in the months following the release you know december all the way through,4515.36,4520.8
"(4521.36, 4527.68)", the spring of 22 we recovered several hundred gallons of fuel off of the surface,4521.36,4527.68
"(4527.68, 4531.84)", through the skimming operations and everything that was required we've continued to maintain,4527.68,4531.84
"(4531.84, 4537.92)", that capture zone and we're to the point now where we're pulling about a teaspoon every 30 days,4531.84,4537.92
"(4538.56, 4544.56)", off of the surface so very very little in quantity but we are maintaining and pulling any,4538.56,4544.56
"(4544.56, 4545.98)", contamination but we did start and pulling any contamination.,4544.56,4545.98
"(4545.98, 4551.52)"," But we did start a pilot study, again, working with all the subject matter experts to, we",4545.98,4551.52
"(4551.52, 4558.24)", developed a pilot study to try to reduce the pumping to the least amount required to maintain,4551.52,4558.24
"(4558.24, 4559.24)", that capture zone.,4558.24,4559.24
"(4559.24, 4563.34)"," So on the 20th of June, we completed that pilot study.",4559.24,4563.34
"(4563.34, 4566.08)", We have resumed up to the pumping rate we were before,4563.34,4566.08
"(4566.08, 4571.6)", about 4.3 million gallons a day we're gathering all the data putting it all together and then,4566.08,4571.6
"(4571.6, 4576.4)", we're going to be sitting down again with that same group of subject matter experts to verify,4571.6,4576.4
"(4576.4, 4585.84)", did we maintain the capture zone effectively and can we permanently reduce our pumping down to that 1.8 million gallon a day average.,4576.4,4585.84
"(4585.84, 4589.38)", On a parallel effort to the reducing the captures or,4585.84,4589.38
"(4589.38, 4593.38)", reducing the pumpers required to capture zones.,4589.38,4593.38
"(4593.38, 4597.86)"," We have been proceeding with there's a military construction project,",4593.38,4597.86
"(4597.86, 4603.32)", an effort for a water treatment facility that we will be installing at the Red Hill.,4597.86,4603.32
"(4603.32, 4605.36)", So that design has been proceeding. The design will be installing at the red hill so that design has been proceeding,4603.32,4605.36
"(4605.36, 4611.04)", the design will be complete this fall obviously there is still the congressional approvals,4605.36,4611.04
"(4611.04, 4615.2)", required to make sure that that military construction project is fully funded before,4611.04,4615.2
"(4615.2, 4628.16)", it is awarded but we are moving very quickly to ensure that we have that water treatment facility ready to go to again knowing that we do not want to forever,4615.2,4628.16
"(4630.88, 4635.44)", understands it so the border watch the bike cuts off their pumps so that you're the only draw in,4630.88,4635.44
"(4635.44, 4642.8)", that aquifer so all this is coming to you you're getting a teaspoon out a month and then that draw,4635.44,4642.8
"(4642.8, 4646.88)", then has to be exit the system so it goes into yava stream,4642.8,4646.88
"(4647.44, 4651.52)", after you've taken the teaspoon full out and you're monitoring that there's no more in there,4647.44,4651.52
"(4651.52, 4657.92)", that's causing damage to the the the repairing so the within the gap the capture zone within,4651.52,4657.92
"(4657.92, 4666.64)", the red hill shaft we are pulling and skimming from the surface of the water. The pump is pulling from 18 foot below the surface,4657.92,4666.64
"(4666.64, 4670.18)", of the water to where we are testing,4666.64,4670.18
"(4670.18, 4672.1)", the water quality there.,4670.18,4672.1
"(4672.1, 4674.92)", We are running it through granular activated carbon,4672.1,4674.92
"(4674.92, 4678.88)", treatment to strip out any TPH related components,4674.92,4678.88
"(4678.88, 4679.94)", that could exist.,4678.88,4679.94
"(4679.94, 4682.2)", And then we are again testing the water,4679.94,4682.2
"(4682.2, 4686.56)", at the effluent side of those gap treatment before it is going,4682.2,4686.56
"(4686.56, 4693.2)", into the the whole lot of stream so it's being tested prior to as well as the exterior and we're,4686.56,4693.2
"(4693.2, 4706.24)", not pulling from the surface we're pulling from 18 and those tests are indicating right those There's no TPH that is being released into the environment at all.,4693.2,4706.24
"(4706.24, 4707.24)", Thank you.,4706.24,4707.24
"(4707.24, 4708.24)", Any other questions?,4707.24,4708.24
"(4708.24, 4709.24)", Go ahead.,4708.24,4709.24
"(4709.24, 4713.76)"," Yeah, pending any questions, I know that there's a lot of detail.",4709.24,4713.76
"(4713.76, 4717.54)"," And again, this is why we will always keep this updated on our website.",4713.76,4717.54
"(4717.54, 4722.64)"," And this is the tool that we're going to utilize any time that I'm briefing, whether it doesn't",4717.54,4722.64
"(4722.64, 4732.0)"," matter what the form is, this is what we will utilize to make sure that that whole transparency is out there, and we continue to move forward in it.",4722.64,4732.0
"(4732.0, 4750.0)"," Excuse me, Chair. This is what you caught the I want me to ask a question. Help me with the 8 remaining monitoring wells. So what is your Eta of putting those online?",4732.0,4750.0
"(4750.0, 4755.0)", Our goal for all of those 8 remaining is to get them complete by the end of the calendar year.,4750.0,4755.0
"(4755.0, 4767.12)", But we have run into substantial issues with some of the the private landowners that are in in the area that are they're not interested in us drilling a well within their,4755.0,4767.12
"(4767.12, 4772.08)", area so we continue again border water supply has been very helpful in uh in helping us to,4767.12,4772.08
"(4772.8, 4778.0)", to maybe uh encourage or to work through some of the permitting requirements obviously we have to,4772.8,4778.0
"(4778.0, 4784.16)", follow all of the section 106 and and following all of the rules but that's what some of our,4778.0,4784.16
"(4784.16, 4786.32)", challenges have been so i can't,4784.16,4786.32
"(4786.32, 4791.76)", say that we are we are still tracking and pushing hard to complete all 22 by the end of the calendar,4786.32,4791.76
"(4791.76, 4797.28)", year but we have some major challenges still to to get through when it comes to some of especially,4791.76,4797.28
"(4797.28, 4805.98)"," those those land agreements that are required so calendar year is uh fy? Sorry, what was that, sir?",4797.28,4805.98
"(4806.76, 4809.12)", Is your calendar year FY24?,4806.76,4809.12
"(4810.98, 4812.42)", Or are you looking at December?,4810.98,4812.42
"(4812.42, 4819.74)"," It would be into the beginning of fiscal year 24, end of calendar year 22.",4812.42,4819.74
"(4820.02, 4825.86)"," So by December 23 is when we would like to have all 22 in place,",4820.02,4825.86
"(4825.88, 4829.52)", but we are a little bit behind schedule due to those land issues right now.,4825.88,4829.52
"(4829.52, 4830.88)"," So thank you, Captain.",4829.52,4830.88
"(4831.34, 4834.42)", And I guess this is for maybe either you or Sarah.,4831.34,4834.42
"(4835.8, 4838.12)"," You know, you've talked about long-term monitoring.",4835.8,4838.12
"(4839.14, 4853.0)", What organization will be in place to carry out the monitoring requirements that you're presently on or is that going to be different?,4839.14,4853.0
"(4853.0, 4868.78)"," There are quite a few resources right now focused on monitoring. Yes, sir. So as the I'm the commanding officer of NAVFAC Hawaii and NAVFAC Hawaii will maintain the",4853.0,4868.78

"(4912.56, 4922.24)", commissioner hannes are you also monitoring um down in any of the stream outflow down,4912.56,4922.24
"(4922.24, 4928.4)"," by pearl harbor and its impacts to aquatic resources, marine resources?",4922.24,4928.4
"(4929.88, 4930.72)"," Yes, ma'am.",4929.88,4930.72
"(4930.72, 4935.08)"," So one of the, following the emergency order,",4930.72,4935.08
"(4935.08, 4936.98)", there was a team from the University of Hawaii,4935.08,4936.98
"(4936.98, 4940.48)", that does ecological monitoring down in the Halawa stream,4936.98,4940.48
"(4940.48, 4943.28)", to ensure that we're not impacting any wildlife,4940.48,4943.28
"(4943.28, 4944.72)", or causing any issues.,4943.28,4944.72
"(4944.72, 4945.8)", And so that's been ongoing.,4944.72,4945.8
"(4946.4, 4951.58)", And we haven't seen any significant issue from that water coming from the GACs.,4946.4,4951.58
"(4952.04, 4955.56)"," So because it is clean water, it's being tested.",4952.04,4955.56
"(4956.1, 4959.74)", We haven't seen any impacts to the lava stream as it's entering Hill Harbor.,4956.1,4959.74
"(4960.76, 4961.72)", That's real helpful.,4960.76,4961.72
"(4961.84, 4969.0)"," So at least we've got some baseline to have some ongoing monitoring to look in the future, whether there's any change.",4961.84,4969.0
"(4969.0, 4975.0)"," Okay, thank you for confirming that. Any other questions? I know it's almost 1030.",4969.0,4975.0
"(4975.0, 4987.68)"," General Hashimoto. Oh, go ahead, Aurora. Sorry, I'm keeping people from coffee break um so i just wanted to add i think aaron was working with that effort as i is that",4975.0,4987.68
"(4987.68, 4995.68)", correct deputy manual that aaron struck is working with the uh team i will defer to the shop but um,4987.68,4995.68
"(4995.68, 5002.16)", kind of uh answering that we've as part of that team we set up kind of a monitoring program with,4995.68,5002.16
"(5002.16, 5006.16)", university employee to be the lead on biological,5002.16,5006.16
"(5006.16, 5014.16)", monitoring of Palawa Stream and then our staff coordinate and or you know talk to the university,5006.16,5014.16
"(5014.16, 5021.84)", employee with that research that's done and we had them present I think it was maybe six months ago,5014.16,5021.84
"(5022.4, 5025.52)", on the findings or if there were any significant findings and they,5022.4,5025.52
"(5026.56, 5032.0)", they didn't find any um impacts at this time but we can make the request maybe at the next,5026.56,5032.0
"(5032.0, 5037.36)", quarterly to maybe do an update more formally on a whole other stream biological monitoring,5032.0,5037.36
"(5037.36, 5045.36)", if that's possible um so i do have a question and this is for Captain Sullivan or Ms. Moody.,5037.36,5045.36
"(5046.38, 5052.62)"," We've talked a lot about monitoring and remediation at specific sites,",5046.38,5052.62
"(5052.82, 5060.26)", but I think I'm curious because I think there's a way that the public understands the word remediation,5052.82,5060.26
"(5060.26, 5063.68)", and the way that agencies use the term remediation.,5060.26,5063.68
"(5064.38, 5066.72)", How do you define and understand remediation?,5064.38,5066.72
"(5066.72, 5069.76)", And then who is responsible not for added three,5066.72,5069.76
"(5069.76, 5073.86)"," or added six, but aquifer cleanup if there is contamination?",5069.76,5073.86
"(5073.86, 5076.38)", And maybe that's also between DOH.,5073.86,5076.38
"(5076.38, 5078.86)"," So I'm not sure who to direct the question to,",5076.38,5078.86
"(5078.86, 5081.42)", but maybe we can start here.,5078.86,5081.42
"(5081.42, 5090.0)", So part of our efforts is looking at Red Hill holistically right it is not just the situation at three or the situation at six.,5081.42,5090.0
"(5090.0, 5094.0)", But because we are actively defueling right now.,5090.0,5094.0
"(5094.0, 5101.0)"," The goals right now is to pursue side assessment planning, which will be the comprehensive look at the entire facility.",5094.0,5101.0
"(5101.0, 5105.36)", All of red hill and identify any historical events that may have occurred at red,5101.0,5105.36
"(5105.36, 5110.88)", hill that we're not currently actively pursuing and then we'll begin the process of active,5105.36,5110.88
"(5110.88, 5118.64)", remediation or exploration as needed once we don't have fuel in the hill right now that risk is not,5110.88,5118.64
"(5118.64, 5124.72)", really worth starting to drill and explore the priorities be fueling and then as we move forward,5118.64,5124.72
"(5124.72, 5127.24)"," we will look at red hill as a holistic site and identify what site remediation needs to drill and explore the priorities be fueling. And then as we move forward, we will look at Red Hill as a holistic site",5124.72,5127.24
"(5127.24, 5129.96)", and identify what site remediation needs to occur.,5127.24,5129.96
"(5129.96, 5131.5)", And this is a long-term effort.,5129.96,5131.5
"(5131.5, 5133.88)", The Navy is committed to the environmental restoration,5131.5,5133.88
"(5133.88, 5135.96)", of Red Hill in the long-term.,5133.88,5135.96
"(5135.96, 5139.16)", So we anticipate a complete comprehensive site assessment,5135.96,5139.16
"(5139.16, 5140.76)", could take several years.,5139.16,5140.76
"(5140.76, 5143.12)", And so that is remedial project management work,5140.76,5143.12
"(5143.12, 5145.24)", that will really be occurring with project,5143.12,5145.24
"(5145.24, 5149.7)", engineers that are down in the details and looking at aerial view footage of the facility,5145.24,5149.7
"(5149.7, 5154.8)"," as a whole, pulling up historical data from the archives, identifying anything that could",5149.7,5154.8
"(5154.8, 5159.5)"," have potentially been located or a certain piece of equipment, or do we need to pull",5154.8,5159.5
"(5159.5, 5162.76)", soil from this location or things of that nature.,5159.5,5162.76
"(5162.76, 5166.08)", And so right now we have very active efforts at edit 3,5162.76,5166.08
"(5166.08, 5172.64)", because of the events in 2021 and we have we had active specific efforts at added six following the,5166.08,5172.64
"(5172.64, 5180.0)", a triple f event um but right now monitoring is is the key goal through defueling just to make sure,5172.64,5180.0
"(5180.0, 5192.48)", nothing is changing in the landscape and then we will pursue the active remediation portion of site assessment and that would be for both um land and water right so there's two there's two,5180.0,5192.48
"(5192.48, 5198.56)", there's two separate and distinct studies that are going to be done or remediation that's going,5192.48,5198.56
"(5198.56, 5207.44)", to be done one for land and one for the aquifer and so how does that that's not on this timeline but at some point it overlaps,5198.56,5207.44
"(5207.44, 5213.68)", with the first timeline and yeah it will continue long long after that the bars on this this timeline,5207.44,5213.68
"(5214.48, 5221.28)", come and go it will be and it would be an effort between the regulator the regulators in this case,5214.48,5221.28
"(5221.28, 5226.8)", would be the department of health and epa um reviewing the plans,5221.28,5226.8
"(5227.76, 5234.16)", and getting input from the public um on the remediation okay but as a water person i'm,5227.76,5234.16
"(5234.16, 5239.36)", wondering how does the aquifer one work because you know when you're cleaning up soil um it stays,5234.16,5239.36
"(5239.36, 5244.32)", in place um not necessarily but right well not necessarily but you know it's a little bit more,5239.36,5244.32
"(5244.32, 5245.0)", straightforward you scrape up the dirty soil you know you know it's a little bit more straightforward.,5244.32,5245.0
"(5245.0, 5249.0)"," You scrape up the dirty soil, you know you move it off site and put it anyways.",5245.0,5249.0
"(5249.0, 5255.0)", But how does do you guys have any sense of where that how that aquifer remediation is going to proceed?,5249.0,5255.0
"(5255.0, 5258.0)", Or are you waiting for the groundwater monitoring modeling studies?,5255.0,5258.0
"(5258.0, 5262.0)"," You know, like yeah, I think I mean I think it's a comment we have to.",5258.0,5262.0
"(5262.0, 5273.12)", We have to do the modeling to see what what's where it's moving but also um like uh sarah said it really is we we really do need to,5262.0,5273.12
"(5274.24, 5290.62)"," in earnest wait until it's defueled because um we want to make sure that there there are studies that are being done, but if there is a drop that enters the environment",5274.24,5290.62
"(5290.62, 5298.24)"," in any way as a result of the defueling effort, we're going to have to analyze that as well.",5290.62,5298.24
"(5298.24, 5303.44)"," We're very sensitive to any penetrations, any pathways that we could create if there",5298.24,5303.44
"(5303.44, 5307.6)", were an event to for them yeah and one,5303.44,5307.6
"(5307.6, 5312.72)", of our primary efforts during defueling is groundwater protection efforts so increased,5307.6,5312.72
"(5312.72, 5319.76)", monitoring of the aquifer of the soil vapor to be able to quickly identify if anything changes,5312.72,5319.76
"(5319.76, 5324.08)", because that's the beauty of having extended periods of data as you can see changes in the,5319.76,5324.08
"(5324.08, 5328.68)", data trends and then act quickly accordingly to make sure we're taking the most protective,5324.08,5328.68
"(5328.68, 5333.78)", stance possible.,5328.68,5333.78
"(5333.78, 5338.32)"," I guess I just have a little bit of trouble seeing like we had a contamination event,",5333.78,5338.32
"(5338.32, 5342.88)"," it moved, it appears to not be as much of a problem anymore, it would be great to see",5338.32,5342.88
"(5342.88, 5346.72)", the data that show that if you have the data and if it is visualized.,5342.88,5346.72
"(5346.72, 5351.74)", I know we can dig it up and look at it under tables.,5346.72,5351.74
"(5351.74, 5353.08)", And then there's a system in place,5351.74,5353.08
"(5353.08, 5355.7)", to do a rapid response if something bad,5353.08,5355.7
"(5355.7, 5357.04)", happens during defueling.,5355.7,5357.04
"(5357.04, 5363.88)"," But I guess, to me, it seems more important",5357.04,5363.88
"(5363.88, 5367.0)", to have a really tight monitoring system in place,5363.88,5367.0
"(5367.0, 5373.38)", because the way model building works is you need data to validate your model.,5367.0,5373.38
"(5373.38, 5378.74)", So you have to have your monitoring network and it has to be high frequency and then you,5373.38,5378.74
"(5378.74, 5379.74)", can build the model.,5378.74,5379.74
"(5379.74, 5382.64)", But the model is only going to tell you something useful in the future if you have a release,5379.74,5382.64
"(5382.64, 5384.76)"," again, which we hopefully won't if we're defueling.",5382.64,5384.76
"(5384.76, 5388.24)", So I'm just trying to piece together so there's the logic,5384.76,5388.24
"(5388.8, 5400.72)", so we have doh epa and uh the university of hawaii has a team that is is trying to understand,5388.8,5400.72
"(5400.72, 5405.34)"," the modeling efforts now, currently.",5400.72,5405.34
"(5405.34, 5408.78)", So there are still inputs that need,5405.34,5408.78
"(5408.78, 5413.12)", to be placed in to complete the model.,5408.78,5413.12
"(5413.12, 5417.22)", And we also have 37 monitoring locations in place right now.,5413.12,5417.22
"(5417.22, 5420.52)", So we are actively monitoring those locations in addition,5417.22,5420.52
"(5420.52, 5422.44)", to the pursuing new locations.,5420.52,5422.44
"(5422.44, 5424.54)"," I think, yeah, I think this is great.",5422.44,5424.54
"(5424.54, 5425.2)", I think there's a lot,5424.54,5425.2
"(5425.2, 5430.08)", of conversations here. Everybody's working really hard. If there is a good opportunity for that,5425.2,5430.08
"(5430.08, 5436.72)"," information to sort of be packaged into something digestible so that the public can understand,",5430.08,5436.72
"(5436.72, 5441.44)"," I mean, and I as a member of the public and I have an advanced degree and I really struggle with it,",5436.72,5441.44
"(5442.56, 5445.06)", like if we can understand the roles,5442.56,5445.06
"(5445.06, 5447.48)"," that everybody's playing on this more,",5445.06,5447.48
"(5448.98, 5451.38)"," not looking at so much at what's happened,",5448.98,5451.38
"(5451.38, 5456.38)", but how we're sort of building better responsiveness,5451.38,5456.38
"(5458.86, 5461.72)", or awareness of what's in the aquifer.,5458.86,5461.72
"(5461.72, 5464.68)", And I believe one of our big efforts has been,5461.72,5464.68
"(5464.68, 5467.68)", to improve the environmental side of our,5464.68,5467.68
"(5467.68, 5472.48)", website to make it as clear as possible so i'm not sure how familiar you are with the interactive,5467.68,5472.48
"(5472.48, 5479.36)", maps that we put in place as well as maps so those discussions are occurring and we're taking the,5472.48,5479.36
"(5479.36, 5486.96)"," recommendations from kathy ho and her team as well well as Ernie, and trying to incorporate and do just what you said,",5479.36,5486.96
"(5486.96, 5491.96)", make it very easily to understand what's going on.,5486.96,5491.96

"(5498.52, 5499.58)", of the website is.,5498.52,5499.58
"(5499.58, 5500.42)"," Okay, that's great.",5499.58,5500.42

"(5506.24, 5510.08)", presentation at the next meeting i think that would be very helpful because yeah like,5506.24,5510.08
"(5510.8, 5518.16)", dr make i said we're focused on water um ma'am i also like that add just a little snippet here,5510.8,5518.16
"(5518.16, 5522.24)", i know people heard there's a lot of websites out there and you're trying to say okay which,5518.16,5522.24

"(6702.48, 6705.44)", about the navy um you know there's an imbalance of power,6702.48,6705.44
"(6705.44, 6711.04)", going on um the navy's presumptions they really are going to have to say that's what i'm hearing,6705.44,6711.04
"(6711.6, 6716.08)", um you know when they say we'll let you know after the briefing is written and we'll share with you,6711.6,6716.08
"(6716.08, 6728.48)", and you take your comments that is different than working alongside of us and so the the empower the balance of power is not right it is our water uh nothing needs water,6716.08,6728.48
"(6728.48, 6734.88)", okay so um first and foremost i wonder if you have all read this uh from the department of health,6728.48,6734.88

"(6778.88, 6786.16)", lack of emergency preparedness to deal in any way with the November 2021 jet fuel de-icing agent and solvents and other,6778.88,6786.16
"(6786.16, 6791.44)", chemicals that were leaked into the drinking water system and adjusted and handled by kelvis military,6786.16,6791.44
"(6791.44, 6796.56)", and civilian households i think the latest evidence and analysis shows without a doubt,6791.44,6796.56
"(6796.56, 6803.28)", that the u.s navy cannot be trusted to manage any water system without strong and continual oversight,6796.56,6803.28

"(6833.68, 6838.4)", i'd like you we'd like you to have a meeting every month um it would be nice if the navy was here,6833.68,6838.4
"(6838.4, 6845.28)", every month and i have red hill an action item um ask the department of health to update their environmental action levels to protect all,6838.4,6845.28

"(6918.56, 6926.0)", having this public meeting for allowing public testimony and for your your time and consideration of this matter and looking into,6918.56,6926.0
"(6926.0, 6936.32)", it uh at one part of the meeting i i heard a concern um whether uh this is relevant and we,6926.0,6936.32
"(6936.32, 6947.92)", were on the slide that was talking about the repurposing of red hill and whether that's relevant for this commission and i just want to ask don't you think,6936.32,6947.92
"(6947.92, 6955.52)", that given the tanks are located in or on right above the aquifer depending on who you ask,6947.92,6955.52
"(6956.4, 6966.48)"," that any repurposing of these tanks would have a relevant impact on our water, potentially permanent impact on our water.",6956.4,6966.48
"(6966.48, 6969.06)", So I hope you consider that.,6966.48,6969.06
"(6969.06, 6971.62)", The other thing I noticed from the presentation was,6969.06,6971.62
"(6971.62, 6975.38)", that I didn't see anything about ag land,6971.62,6975.38
"(6975.38, 6979.02)"," and it's been known that these PFAS,",6975.38,6979.02

"(6996.24, 7003.58)"," and they said the military came, asked to make sure that no one was drinking any of the water",6996.24,7003.58
"(7003.58, 7005.6)", that's being pumped into their homes,7003.58,7005.6
"(7008.88, 7010.88)", and then left without doing anything and then the landlord in that property,7008.88,7010.88
"(7015.52, 7027.2)", has tested the water but won't release the results to the residents and their young children are bathing in this water sometimes drinking it even though they're being told not to but they're little kids so they do what they like uh and it's it's just something that,7015.52,7027.2
"(7028.32, 7033.84)", i think we should look also at the ag land because that's very important and i i know,7028.32,7033.84
"(7033.84, 7039.92)", you're the commissioner of water resource management but if not you who if not when,7033.84,7039.92
"(7040.48, 7045.92)", oh if not now i need to i need to respond what you're saying you're obviously referring,7040.48,7045.92
"(7045.92, 7052.4)", to my comments when you said that i somebody said it was irrelevant wrong okay i apologize,7045.92,7052.4
"(7052.4, 7057.52)", i did not say that what i said was that we were starting to range too far away from the water,7052.4,7057.52
"(7057.52, 7066.56)", issue so don't don't go mischaracterizing my comments please other than other than that other than that i'm fine with what,7057.52,7066.56
"(7066.56, 7072.48)", you said okay thank you thank you could you wrap up could you summarize your testimony i'll stop,7066.56,7072.48

"(7139.2, 7142.72)"," some information from the closure supplement too,",7139.2,7142.72
"(7142.72, 7146.56)", which they received after they already provided the,7142.72,7146.56
"(7146.56, 7154.8)", comments and then because i transcribed the f-jack excerpts from the f-jack i don't plan on going,7146.56,7154.8

"(7172.0, 7189.36)", So that would be helpful for me and maybe for other people the other statement i'd like to make is anything under,7172.0,7189.36
"(7189.36, 7200.16)", 266 parts per billion will be designated as non-detect i do not support any reuse of this,7189.36,7200.16

"(7267.92, 7274.72)", there's two points i want to make the navy believes reuse is outside the UST closure requirements and are not aware of other closed USTs that have been reused for non-fuel purposes. These are these are taken directly from my,7267.92,7274.72
"(7275.84, 7285.0)"," references and the last one is during the FCHAC the DOH presented,",7275.84,7285.0

"(7404.4, 7408.06)", health advisory system based on the information in this.,7404.4,7408.06

"(7431.6, 7439.6)", i we will look at that but i um i have to talk to our toxicologists so we'll look at that okay,7431.6,7439.6
"(7439.6, 7449.44)", it would be yeah okay um let me see yeah another thing so we're all talking about reusing red hill and,7439.6,7449.44
"(7449.44, 7457.68)", we're all staring at this you know chart that says 54 of the people don't want it repurposed,7449.44,7457.68
"(7458.48, 7466.96)", and yet there's this assumption that we will repurpose it. And this discussion keeps going on almost deaf to the fact,7458.48,7466.96
"(7466.96, 7469.48)", that most people don't want it repurposed.,7466.96,7469.48
"(7469.48, 7473.5)", Why are we proceeding with trying to repurpose it again?,7469.48,7473.5

"(7482.56, 7483.48)", Can I respond?,7482.56,7483.48
"(7484.56, 7491.04)", So it is a a in all things you know in a lot of things when we're,7484.56,7491.04
"(7491.04, 7497.76)", dealing with solid waste those are the three r's reduce reuse and recycle and so we it's not a,7491.04,7497.76
"(7497.76, 7511.44)", requirement it in this context so you're choosing to do it no this context. It's not a requirement. It is. Would you please look at this and determine whether one you can reuse it?,7497.76,7511.44
"(7511.44, 7516.72)"," For example, some people have said, why don't we get the University of Hawaii",7511.44,7516.72
"(7517.36, 7527.3)", to do a research center there? Or why don't you make it into a museum? Those are reuses of that facility.,7517.36,7527.3

"(7536.84, 7541.1)"," It's just, will you take a look at these three criteria",7536.84,7541.1
"(7541.1, 7548.32)", and see if you could reuse it and recycle it meaning could be taking out the pipelines and,7541.1,7548.32
"(7548.32, 7555.6)", the pipes or the electrical system and reuse it in some other way it's just these are three three,7548.32,7555.6
"(7555.6, 7572.0)", words that we want that we want the navy and the public to think about is there a way that you can reuse or reduce or recycle this facility to make it a better facility or to make it into something different?,7555.6,7572.0
"(7572.0, 7576.0)", It's not a requirement. It is a goal of ours.,7572.0,7576.0
"(7576.0, 7586.88)"," Okay, so there's still the option of just closing and not absolutely absolutely good money after that no absolutely i i thought we we covered",7576.0,7586.88
"(7586.88, 7592.72)", that my question was what did we miss we had a we had a good discussion of that because we said we,7586.88,7592.72
"(7592.72, 7597.68)", want some criteria we want to see what the now the options are we want a thorough analysis of each,7592.72,7597.68
"(7597.68, 7605.0)", option again as long as and we we see what the public thinks that data is clear.,7597.68,7605.0
"(7605.0, 7611.0)"," Bring us back to the agenda. I mean, Neil, is that what you wanted?",7605.0,7611.0
"(7611.0, 7616.0)", Is that what you asked? Okay. All right.,7611.0,7616.0
"(7616.0, 7629.04)"," So hearing no other public testimony, no other. other any other questions from the commission okay i am going to close either be one yes um",7616.0,7629.04
"(7631.2, 7637.28)", so this is addressing susan again because of the first item you brought up and maybe um,7631.2,7637.28
"(7638.4, 7650.8)", uh commissioner whole um my understanding is that um dr brewer's findings once released sort of sit,7638.4,7650.8
"(7650.8, 7659.84)", in the lap of what doh takes care of what role or what important insights do we as commissioners,7650.8,7659.84
"(7659.84, 7670.5)", make when we're often tasked with water quantity issues. How do we use this information to guide our efforts?,7659.84,7670.5
"(7670.5, 7672.66)", Is it relevant?,7670.5,7672.66
"(7672.66, 7674.46)", Because it seems like important information.,7672.66,7674.46
"(7674.46, 7676.8)", I was reading it last.,7674.46,7676.8
"(7676.8, 7682.26)", So this assessment was really done,7676.8,7682.26
"(7682.26, 7690.72)", to help CDC in its efforts. So that was the sole purpose for the drafting of this document.,7682.26,7690.72
"(7691.44, 7699.68)", CDC will take this document and do what it needs to do to analyze and come up with its own funding.,7691.44,7699.68
"(7700.0, 7717.0)", Okay. Okay. And then there's this this public understanding and I'm just trying to understand where some of the tension or frustration may lie and I feel like as Department of Health you're supposed to be looking for our health.,7700.0,7717.0
"(7717.0, 7727.76)"," And so to say that you're just going to give it to the CDC, and not like revise your medical advisory so we are we're we're constantly looking and as you",7717.0,7727.76
"(7727.76, 7734.16)", know if you know roger brewer we're constantly looking and revising our eals and all kinds of,7727.76,7734.16
"(7734.16, 7747.28)", things so it is it is something that we are constantly looking at i can't commit to you today that we are going to change our advisory because that's not i'm not,7734.16,7747.28
"(7747.28, 7755.04)", the sme but i can say that we will i will bring it back to my team to look at and make a determination,7747.28,7755.04
"(7756.16, 7761.2)", and i think it would be a disservice if you didn't in my opinion revise that medical advisory based,7756.16,7761.2
"(7761.2, 7766.16)", on the information now that you have and it's not just about jet fuel,7761.2,7766.16
"(7766.16, 7772.56)", it's the solvents it's the um deicers it's all of those things in there and the impact it has,7766.16,7772.56
"(7772.56, 7779.44)", on people when they're they're exposed to it all together if i may can i intervene switch into my,7772.56,7779.44
"(7779.44, 7788.86)"," ua chat yeah um i think uh reviewing, the complexity of the biology of the situation requires a",7779.44,7788.86
"(7788.86, 7799.86)"," different expertise. And I do think that is CDC, but I think there's need for specialists",7788.86,7799.86
"(7799.86, 7806.58)", and experts that may not be employed by DOH. So I think it's a really important landmark,7799.86,7806.58
"(7806.58, 7808.84)", to convene more conversations around,7806.58,7808.84
"(7808.84, 7813.84)"," and what about how to look for the effects of the de-icers,",7808.84,7813.84

"(7831.24, 7833.2)", So I think there's important conversations,7831.24,7833.2

"(7858.96, 7866.72)", appropriate things that they thought it was necessary that's a conversation for another time and i guess our other frustration is,7858.96,7866.72
"(7867.76, 7874.0)", excuse me can can i just call order to this i want to stay in our lane i mean i think these,7867.76,7874.0
"(7874.0, 7881.44)", are great conversations doh has its own platform um i would like to bring us back i mean we we're,7874.0,7881.44

"(7916.28, 7917.12)", Okay.,7916.28,7917.12

"(8213.5, 8215.3)"," you can look at that, you know,",8213.5,8215.3

"(8359.76, 8366.42)", the consequences of taking groundwater from that is water table reduction and saltwater rise,8359.76,8366.42
"(8366.42, 8372.18)"," and reduction of discharge to the ocean. Where there is cap rock, then the freshwater lens",8366.42,8372.18
"(8372.18, 8379.32)", is thicker because the cap rock resists the flow of water to the ocean. The freshwater,8372.18,8379.32
"(8379.32, 8384.42)"," lens gets thicker, but it also causes some of the groundwater discharge to discharge",8379.32,8384.42
"(8384.42, 8389.0)"," above sea level to springs, such as Pearl Harbor Springs, a good example.",8384.42,8389.0
"(8389.0, 8398.0)"," And so when you take water from this system, again, you have water table decline and rise of saltwater and encroachment of saltwater,",8389.0,8398.0
"(8398.0, 8409.12)", but you also have reduction of discharge to streams that are on land um in the dyke impounded groundwater system we have,8398.0,8409.12
"(8409.12, 8415.2)", low permeability dikes volcanic dikes that have um impounded groundwater hundreds of feet above,8409.12,8415.2
"(8415.2, 8427.12)", sea level and where the erosion has exposed the dikes then water discharges from these dead compartments and feed streams and support,8415.2,8427.12
"(8427.12, 8433.44)", stream base flow when you take water from this system then again you have water table decline,8427.12,8433.44
"(8433.44, 8440.88)", and reduction of groundwater discharge to streams and and springs and things on the on the land,8433.44,8440.88
"(8440.88, 8445.2)", there's also reduction of groundwater recharge the ocean there is some salt,8440.88,8445.2
"(8445.2, 8453.2)", water uh encroachment near the coast but for the most part this area is not going to be,8445.2,8453.2
"(8455.28, 8467.8)"," affected by salt water intrusion okay and then there's a stickyly saturated aquifers. These are aquifers that are not highly permeable,",8455.28,8467.8
"(8467.8, 8473.76)"," that the entire aquifer is made out of low permeability rock. And in particular, the",8467.8,8473.76
"(8473.76, 8481.2)"," example that I've worked on is the one on Kauai in the Lihue Basin where lava flows,",8473.76,8481.2
"(8481.2, 8494.84)"," thick lava flows have filled in pre-existing depressions and formed these thick, low permeability aquifers. And in this case, the fresh water saturates all the way to the land surface and much of the, excuse me,",8481.2,8494.84
"(8496.08, 8506.0)"," much of the groundwater discharge occurs at streams above sea level. So of course, if you take water from that, one of the biggest impacts is going to be to",8496.08,8506.0
"(8507.92, 8513.28)", would be reduction of stream flow. There is also reduction of groundwater discharge at the ocean.,8507.92,8513.28
"(8513.28, 8520.64)"," There likely is salt water encroachment near the coast, but you know this freshwater",8513.28,8520.64

"(8532.0, 8539.68)", Okay so the one enigmatic occurrence that I'm going to talk about today is the Schofield high level groundwater.,8532.0,8539.68
"(8539.68, 8547.2)", It's an area of high level groundwater that's higher than you would expect from in in high,8539.68,8547.2
"(8547.2, 8554.88)", permeability aquifer um we know from data groundwater data that it's not perched it's,8547.2,8554.88
"(8554.88, 8559.28)", saturated all the way down to sea level and fresh water probably extends quite a bit below sea level,8554.88,8559.28
"(8560.08, 8567.04)", um many hydrologists have postulated some sort of a groundwater barrier like a dam vertical structure,8560.08,8567.04
"(8568.16, 8576.08)", that is supporting this but the actual structure is not really known. Now the probably the main,8568.16,8576.08
"(8576.08, 8582.4)", consequence of taking water out of this is reduction of groundwater flow to adjacent aquifers.,8576.08,8582.4
"(8582.4, 8588.24)"," So yeah it will reduce the amount of water available in the adjacent aquifers. So yeah, it will reduce the amount of water available in the adjacent",8582.4,8588.24
"(8588.24, 8600.8)"," aquifers. Okay, so to quantify the consequences of groundwater withdrawal for this study,",8588.24,8600.8
"(8600.8, 8609.04)"," we use groundwater models of Kauai, O'ahu, and Maui. These islands have most of the,",8600.8,8609.04

"(8617.44, 8633.76)", so at least we can test them. We created calibrated models which had 2001 to 2010 conditions for pumping and recharge,8617.44,8633.76

"(10223.76, 10229.76)", and dean with surface water is to look at this more comprehensively um maybe just for clarification,10223.76,10229.76

"(10292.88, 10300.08)", so we wouldn't so much change the sustainable yield uh but rather we would change allocations,10292.88,10300.08

"(10321.6, 10328.58)", of these ranges um the commission could open that box up and look at where there's,10321.6,10328.58

"(10511.66, 10514.56)"," and unfortunately, I don't know what the current status",10511.66,10514.56
"(10514.56, 10519.56)"," of it is, but it was somehow getting the ability",10514.56,10519.56

"(10524.72, 10529.28)", to run certain things on groundwater models.,10524.72,10529.28
"(10529.28, 10535.18)", Because that's really what I think the value of the groundwater model would be.,10529.28,10535.18
"(10535.18, 10548.32)"," So you could say, okay, I'm going to put wells in here and here and here, put it on and they've i think they've explored things like uh web-based um uh you know a web-based tool",10535.18,10548.32
"(10548.32, 10554.48)", that does that and then because groundwater models take a while to run and but that's going to change,10548.32,10554.48
"(10554.48, 10559.36)", because things are going to get faster and faster faster but anyway because groundwater models take,10554.48,10559.36

"(10569.04, 10578.84)"," ready for you at a certain time and then they would send you a text and say okay here's your results, so you know, maybe might take a couple days for the groundwater model to run that scenario.",10569.04,10578.84
"(10579.38, 10586.56)"," But anyway, scenario testing should, I think, I would just looking into the future that's probably might",10579.38,10586.56

"(11048.4, 11054.48)", of the county water use and development plan per se is is somewhat limiting um although it's,11048.4,11054.48
"(11054.48, 11060.64)", broader um but in the title it's basically a plan for water use and development basically how much,11054.48,11060.64

"(11136.56, 11149.32)", regional watershed management plans we we feel that we've addressed a large part of that. And so you may know that what was broken up,11136.56,11149.32
"(11150.32, 11152.7)", in the general plan into eight land use districts,11150.32,11152.7

"(11290.08, 11297.36)", is the stewardship in kuleana that comes with the alpua model around land water people,11290.08,11297.36
"(11297.36, 11305.0)", people and culture it's a culture that affects behaviors and by improving those behaviors,11297.36,11305.0
"(11305.9, 11310.72)"," towards conservation, no waste, recognition",11305.9,11310.72
"(11310.72, 11312.64)"," of where water comes from,",11310.72,11312.64
"(11312.64, 11317.64)"," restoration of cultural sites and fish bonds and collo,",11312.64,11317.64
"(11319.32, 11322.66)", all of those get folded in into these behaviors,11319.32,11322.66
"(11322.66, 11329.68)", so that it basically is the glue that supports what's in the plan.,11322.66,11329.68
"(11330.64, 11339.68)"," Okay, so next. So our goal is to balance the preservation and restoration management of all",11330.64,11339.68
"(11339.68, 11345.44)"," watersheds, right, Makatumakai, with the sustainable ground and surface water used in development",11339.68,11345.44
"(11345.44, 11354.16)", to serve present and future generations um in chapter one we define this goal we also,11345.44,11354.16
"(11354.16, 11367.76)", define the five objectives of which are all um which are applied to all of the regional plans the objectives are defined and they,11354.16,11367.76
"(11369.76, 11379.6)", are are are different are defined as our future um state i guess so what does a sustainable,11369.76,11379.6
"(11379.6, 11387.36)", watershed look like um so promoting that protecting and enhancing water quality and quantity,11379.6,11387.36
"(11388.08, 11391.12)", protecting native Hawaiian rights and traditional customary practices,11388.08,11391.12
"(11392.08, 11397.6)", facilitating public participation education and project implementation and this is the behavior,11392.08,11397.6
"(11397.6, 11408.08)", side that I was talking about from the all-wound model and then meeting water demands at reasonable costs each of these objectives drive specific,11397.6,11408.08
"(11409.92, 11413.92)", policies projects and strategies in each of the eight regions,11409.92,11413.92
"(11415.92, 11422.96)", and and if it wasn't you know we tried to make it explicit it's not just happens if you do something,11415.92,11422.96
"(11422.96, 11425.52)", we're directly trying to,11422.96,11425.52
"(11429.12, 11432.0)", meet these objectives in each of these regional plants okay next,11429.12,11432.0
"(11439.28, 11440.24)", so i just wanted to talk about the chapter one next chapter one was basically the um,11439.28,11440.24
"(11445.0, 11445.52)", essentially the same format as the first adopted,11445.0,11445.52
"(11447.9, 11449.94)", water management plan in 1990. Water code was adopted in 87.,11447.9,11449.94
"(11451.44, 11454.5)", So chapter one is the island wide,11451.44,11454.5
"(11455.44, 11457.26)", water use and development plan.,11455.44,11457.26
"(11457.26, 11459.8)", It also incorporates what the commission did,11457.26,11459.8
"(11459.8, 11463.4)"," was hire Peter Adler and he came up with the,",11459.8,11463.4
"(11464.48, 11465.0)"," you know, his Adler report",11464.48,11465.0
"(11467.5, 11470.42)", on Oahu needs in 2020.,11467.5,11470.42
"(11470.42, 11474.64)", So the format and the organizational structure,11470.42,11474.64
"(11475.86, 11478.02)", is very much aligned with that.,11475.86,11478.02
"(11478.02, 11479.58)", And this is in every plan.,11478.02,11479.58
"(11479.58, 11482.36)"," So we talk about authority and purpose framework,",11479.58,11482.36
"(11482.36, 11485.6)", which I went through in the water development plan which,11482.36,11485.6
"(11485.6, 11491.2)", talks about island-wide demand forecasts supply availability for urban and agriculture conservation,11485.6,11491.2
"(11491.2, 11496.24)", existing and planned sources alternatives and transfers and i believe there's a discussion,11491.2,11496.24
"(11496.24, 11501.52)", about how we transfer water around the island because we have the infrastructure to do that,11496.24,11501.52
"(11502.08, 11505.92)", the other report talked about certain uncertainties,11502.08,11505.92
"(11512.0, 11513.68)"," such as in-stream and impertinent rights, Hawaiian homeland, alternative source costs,",11512.0,11513.68
"(11526.3, 11531.3)", alternative source impacts to aquifers and the recharge rates and pumping effects your streams. What we added here is a contingency section that offers a list of strategies on what to do about it.,11526.3,11531.3
"(11532.76, 11534.96)", And so I'd encourage you to read that,11532.76,11534.96
"(11534.96, 11536.76)", when the public review draft comes up,11534.96,11536.76
"(11538.3, 11541.02)", and I'll get into that in more detail.,11538.3,11541.02
"(11541.02, 11544.78)"," The plan implementation is how we allocate water,",11541.02,11544.78
"(11544.78, 11548.86)", how we invest in infrastructure.,11544.78,11548.86
"(11548.86, 11555.48)"," You know, the reasonable beneficial uses is defined first through the water use permits,",11548.86,11555.48
"(11555.48, 11561.48)", and then we allocate water on a first come first serve basis with an adequate facilities,11555.48,11561.48
"(11561.48, 11567.12)", review. I might add that when we do allocate water we also look at,11561.48,11567.12
"(11567.12, 11573.12)", reasonable beneficial uses ensure that conservation measures are employed ensure that we require them,11567.12,11573.12
"(11573.12, 11578.16)", to connect to recycled water systems if they're adjacent before we can before we issue the meter,11573.12,11578.16
"(11578.16, 11590.88)", so it's conditional to those types of uses next so in the uncertainties and contingencies we we um describe what some of,11578.16,11590.88
"(11590.88, 11595.84)", the you know all the uncertainties that we could think of that have been affecting planning over,11590.88,11595.84
"(11595.84, 11601.6)", the last couple of decades estimating and recovering sustainable yields uh it's it's one,11595.84,11601.6
"(11602.32, 11606.64)", foods are talking about estimating sustainable yield. How do we recover that?,11602.32,11606.64
"(11606.64, 11610.78)", And you can't recover it all in a lot of places.,11606.64,11610.78
"(11610.78, 11616.18)", How does climate change and drought impacts affect recharge and sustainable yield and,11610.78,11616.18
"(11616.18, 11617.76)", what to do about it?,11616.18,11617.76
"(11617.76, 11620.22)"," Contamination, of course.",11617.76,11620.22
"(11620.22, 11624.24)", Groundwater dependent ecosystems were brought up in the last administration.,11620.22,11624.24
"(11624.24, 11631.76)", So we have a section on that basically sustainable yield is a percent of recharge the the remaining percent is,11624.24,11631.76
"(11631.76, 11639.92)", allowed to flow to the ocean uh to support these uh ecosystems uh and that um you know we had some,11631.76,11639.92
"(11639.92, 11645.52)"," strategies around that um i know there's some interim industry flow standards,",11639.92,11645.52
"(11646.68, 11649.42)", effects on stream flows and protection and restoration,11646.68,11649.42
"(11649.42, 11651.8)"," there, drought impacts the stream flows",11649.42,11651.8
"(11651.8, 11653.12)", and the diversions in use.,11651.8,11653.12
"(11653.12, 11656.7)", So it's this conjunctive use of using stream diversions,11653.12,11656.7
"(11656.7, 11660.2)", and wells in drought times,11656.7,11660.2
"(11660.2, 11662.94)"," so you can maximize the stream flow,",11660.2,11662.94
"(11662.94, 11665.84)", how you can make ditch irrigation systems more efficient through,11662.94,11665.84
"(11665.84, 11670.4)", piping the ditches and then uncertainties around urban and agricultural demands,11665.84,11670.4
"(11671.52, 11676.64)", urban is fairly you know it's it's you know everybody wants to bank water so they end up,11671.52,11676.64
"(11676.64, 11686.6)"," having their demands high i see agricultural demands as having a wider range. But anyway, we have these sections",11676.64,11686.6
"(11686.6, 11689.14)", where we try to estimate uncertainties,11686.6,11689.14
"(11689.14, 11690.3)", and provide some solutions.,11689.14,11690.3
"(11690.3, 11692.38)", So on a NILA-wide basis.,11690.3,11692.38

"(11787.92, 11793.36)"," As mentioned, we've had stakeholder consultations throughout this process with both community",11787.92,11793.36
"(11793.36, 11808.56)", organizations that work in the district on various activities related to watershed health as well as county and state agencies in addition to regular,11793.36,11808.56
"(11808.56, 11815.36)", neighborhood board presentations to the district's three neighborhood boards in addition to the,11808.56,11815.36
"(11816.0, 11827.76)"," community meetings that were just mentioned so now i'll be moving into chapter two, which is really sets a foundation for for the plan, as it provides a",11816.0,11827.76

"(11835.48, 11854.0)"," mentioned, this plan takes a very comprehensive view of watershed health. So this chapter really digs into all the different historical, cultural, environmental factors that impact watershed health.",11835.48,11854.0
"(11854.0, 11865.72)"," As just as a quick kind of context, the district again encompasses 10 different watersheds and spans from Kahala to Makapu'u.",11854.0,11865.72
"(11867.34, 11874.74)"," And through our process of both research as well as stakeholder consultations, this chapter two",11867.34,11874.74
"(11874.74, 11881.22)", really kind of culminates around eight different water resource issues that kind of rose to the top,11874.74,11881.22
"(11881.22, 11887.52)", of the community's priorities in terms of issues that are impacting watershed,11881.22,11887.52
"(11887.52, 11893.6)", health in the area and those are including climate change sea level rise near shore water quality,11887.52,11893.6
"(11893.6, 11900.64)", flooding and drainage wildfires and others that are listed here and so while i don't have time,11893.6,11900.64
"(11900.64, 11905.36)", in this presentation to get obviously into all of those topics i just wanted to highlight,11900.64,11905.36
"(11905.36, 11912.72)", within this plan that we do provide both analytical as well as spatial data both,11905.36,11912.72
"(11912.72, 11918.0)", analytically and spatially to discuss these different topics that were just mentioned,11912.72,11918.0
"(11918.56, 11928.0)", so for example to kind of better understand the both opportunities and challenges for topics such as cultural resources.,11918.56,11928.0
"(11928.0, 11939.0)"," Our team both mapped out historical and existing resources such as fish ponds, freshwater springs, heiaus,",11928.0,11939.0

"(11946.52, 11950.32)", And then as another example to better understand,11946.52,11950.32
"(11950.32, 11952.44)"," the topic of wildfire hazard,",11950.32,11952.44

"(11967.36, 11972.48)", And so both of those are just examples to show the type of in-depth analysis that we went through,11967.36,11972.48
"(11972.48, 11980.32)"," for all the different factors that were presented in in chapter two. So moving on to chapter three,",11972.48,11980.32

"(12273.22, 12279.12)"," there would be existing the existing water supply would be adequate, but that in the",12273.22,12279.12
"(12279.12, 12284.72)", high or mid or high demand scenarios that this would require additional water resources,12279.12,12284.72
"(12284.72, 12285.44)", or improved,12284.72,12285.44
"(12286.08, 12294.08)", a water efficiency similarly in the ultimate demand scenario even though it is obviously more,12286.08,12294.08
"(12294.08, 12305.92)", difficult to project out water supply it in at such a great time distance and from 2100 we estimate that under the wet scenario because of,12294.08,12305.92
"(12306.72, 12313.28)", because of anticipated increased rainfall that there would be adequate water supply,12306.72,12313.28
"(12314.08, 12320.24)", and in the dry scenario that there would need to be improved water efficiency to meet the water,12314.08,12320.24
"(12320.24, 12328.34)"," demand so kind of all this is to say in terms of our key takeaways from this water analysis,",12320.24,12328.34
"(12328.94, 12336.92)"," that both kind of under the existing situation as well as the future scenarios, that even though",12328.94,12336.92
"(12336.92, 12346.3)", we do project that East Honolulu would have adequate supply under the most probable scenario that due to their limited in-district,12336.92,12346.3
"(12346.3, 12356.98)", supply that they have a heightened kuleana to user water efficiently due to the impacts that,12346.3,12356.98
"(12356.98, 12371.68)"," water transfers can have on the districts that they're being transferred from. So next I'll be moving into chapter four, which is focused on the goals,",12356.98,12371.68
"(12371.68, 12379.38)"," policies, as well as descriptions of the projects, programs, and strategies to achieve those goals",12371.68,12379.38
"(12379.38, 12408.16)"," and objectives. So as a quick note regarding how these policies, projects, and strategies are all related, some of those, the water resource issues that were discussed previously in this presentation that were highlighted in Chapter 2, as well as the results of the water demand analysis informed the district sub objectives.",12379.38,12408.16
"(12408.68, 12413.0)"," From there, the projects with champions, as well as the general strategies,",12408.68,12413.0
"(12413.6, 12418.28)", essentially align with those sub objectives and are used to advance,12413.6,12418.28
"(12419.64, 12421.24)", advance those policies.,12419.64,12421.24
"(12421.24, 12426.32)", And from from from all of those projects emerge the catalyst projects which,12421.24,12426.32
"(12426.32, 12433.76)", are essentially the the vehicle being we see as being used to implement the projects and strategies,12426.32,12433.76
"(12435.28, 12469.68)"," so as a note we have identified 30 different projects with champions so these projects with champions have either an existing community or government champion who has been slated to carry out these efforts and they cover a wide range of activities such as fish pond restoration, hay restoration, coral assistant evolution, invasive species removals, and so forth.",12435.28,12469.68
"(12470.8, 12477.6)"," And just as again, I wanted to point out that these projects are both site-specific.",12470.8,12477.6
"(12478.24, 12487.12)"," We have about nine, we have nine projects that are site specific with the remaining 21 projects being focused district-wide.",12478.24,12487.12
"(12488.8, 12494.64)"," So at a lower tier than the projects, we have the strategies and programs. And so while these",12488.8,12494.64
"(12496.32, 12507.4)", activities are also slated to advance the sub-objectives that we've identified in the plan. They do not have an existing project.,12496.32,12507.4
"(12507.4, 12509.46)", They do not have an existing community,12507.4,12509.46
"(12509.46, 12514.46)", or government champion.,12509.46,12514.46
"(12514.96, 12518.12)"," However, they're still important for advancing",12514.96,12518.12
"(12520.18, 12523.24)", the objectives that were outlined in the plan.,12520.18,12523.24
"(12524.66, 12528.88)"," So lastly, chapter five five we're moving into implementation",12524.66,12528.88
"(12529.52, 12535.44)", so this chapter discusses the water use and development plan so essentially goes into more,12529.52,12535.44
"(12535.44, 12548.76)"," detail regarding some of the topics discussed in chapter three around the strategies for ensuring water source adequacy for the region, and then goes into the",12535.44,12548.76
"(12548.76, 12555.18)"," priority watersheds, the catalyst projects, implementation entities, and potential funding.",12548.76,12555.18
"(12556.34, 12560.32)"," So for the purposes of this presentation, I'll focus on the catalyst projects,",12556.34,12560.32
"(12560.32, 12567.0)", which are essentially just a higher priority project that will provide the energy and connectivity,12560.32,12567.0
"(12567.0, 12570.0)", for the different projects and programs,12567.0,12570.0
"(12570.0, 12572.0)", that we've outlined in this plan.,12570.0,12572.0
"(12572.0, 12575.0)"," And some of these, some components of these projects",12572.0,12575.0
"(12575.0, 12577.0)"," will be focused in priority watersheds,",12575.0,12577.0
"(12577.0, 12580.0)", which we're defining as watersheds,12577.0,12580.0
"(12580.0, 12587.74)", that require special protection for water quality or provide special opportunities for,12580.0,12587.74
"(12587.74, 12595.48)", provide implementing watershed management programs so for the Isanalulu watershed management plan,12587.74,12595.48
"(12595.48, 12601.96)", we've identified two key Catalyst projects the first of which being to improve water quality,12595.48,12601.96
"(12601.96, 12606.16)", in Malauua Bay that's something that just came up over and over again,12601.96,12606.16
"(12606.16, 12610.3)", in all of our consultations with community groups,12606.16,12610.3
"(12610.3, 12613.32)", as well as our government stakeholders.,12610.3,12613.32
"(12613.7, 12616.98)", And so we're looking to focus that catalyst project,12613.7,12616.98
"(12616.98, 12618.74)"," in the priority watersheds,",12616.98,12618.74
"(12618.9, 12621.6)", essentially the six watersheds within the district,12618.9,12621.6
"(12621.6, 12623.0)", that feed into the bay.,12621.6,12623.0
"(12623.0, 12626.78)", And the second catalyst project being to increase,12623.0,12626.78
"(12626.78, 12630.22)", water efficiency and that largely stems from,12626.78,12630.22
"(12631.82, 12636.02)", the takeaways of our water demand analysis,12631.82,12636.02
"(12636.02, 12640.72)", being that water conservation is really key in the district.,12636.02,12640.72
"(12640.72, 12642.76)"," So for each of these catalyst projects,",12640.72,12642.76
"(12642.76, 12665.0)"," we identify identify measurable goals to achieve through these catalyst projects, and some of them being for water quality in Mauna Loa Bay, including reduce the amount of invasive algae, increase the amount of healthy living coral, and so forth.",12642.76,12665.0
"(12667.16, 12669.02)"," And again, just wanted to emphasize",12667.16,12669.02
"(12669.02, 12671.32)"," that this Catalyst project,",12669.02,12671.32
"(12671.32, 12674.46)", we're focusing the implementation of it,12671.32,12674.46
"(12674.46, 12679.46)", within these priority watersheds that feed into the bay.,12674.46,12679.46
"(12679.74, 12682.9)"," And this Catalyst project,",12679.74,12682.9
"(12682.9, 12687.44)", we've identified various different actions to achieve and carry,12682.9,12687.44
"(12687.44, 12692.7)", out the catalyst project and many of these actions have actually been previously identified,12687.44,12692.7
"(12692.7, 12699.1)"," by the Moanalua Watershed Hui, which is essentially a collective of community groups that are",12692.7,12699.1

"(12703.14, 12706.58)"," So I wanted to highlight, as you can see from that last map,",12703.14,12706.58
"(12707.52, 12715.24)"," these actions are both located in both Mauka and Makai areas. For example, in the Wailupe",12707.52,12715.24
"(12715.24, 12721.46)"," watershed, we've identified the Wailupe watershed stream restoration as one of the key actions.",12715.24,12721.46
"(12722.36, 12726.48)"," In the Neo watershed, in the upper watershed in the upper in in the upper watershed we've",12722.36,12726.48
"(12726.48, 12732.32)", identified watershed fencing mid the middle watershed invasive species removal in need of,12726.48,12732.32
"(12732.32, 12740.48)", outplanting and then in the lower watershed that invasive algae removal which is being,12732.32,12740.48
"(12740.48, 12748.22)"," carried out by lalama manalua. Kulea'o, we identified ongoing fish pond restoration,",12740.48,12748.22
"(12748.22, 12751.76)", as well as watershed retention and infiltration,12748.22,12751.76
"(12751.76, 12753.38)", in the upper watershed.,12751.76,12753.38
"(12753.38, 12758.5)"," And Ha'aone, we've identified wetland and heiau restoration,",12753.38,12758.5
"(12758.5, 12761.76)", which is currently being carried out.,12758.5,12761.76
"(12761.76, 12767.08)"," And lastly, in the Kamila Nui and Kamila Iki identified a range of actions,",12761.76,12767.08
"(12767.08, 12772.32)"," including reforestation, the sustainable agricultural pilot project, as well as",12767.08,12772.32
"(12772.32, 12779.48)"," restoration of Kawapa Pond. So moving now into Catalyst Project number two, again,",12772.32,12779.48
"(12779.62, 12790.58)"," which is to increase water efficiency in East Honolulu. Again, we identified measurable goals, which include maintaining East Honolulu's per capita water demand",12779.62,12790.58
"(12790.58, 12795.8)"," through 2040 at 170 gallons per person per day,",12790.58,12795.8
"(12795.8, 12810.88)", and then a longer range goal to reduce per capita water demand to 130 gallons per person per day by 2100. So these actions that carry out this,12795.8,12810.88
"(12810.88, 12820.32)", Catalyst project are looked at a more district-wide view from both increasing essentially water,12810.88,12820.32
"(12820.32, 12826.4)", efficiency from the water distributors as well as the water users. I would say with,12820.32,12826.4
"(12826.4, 12830.54)"," the exception of the action that we've identified in the Cocoa Head watershed,",12826.4,12830.54

"(12840.74, 12849.0)"," So I wanted just to note that within the plan itself, I know it was kind of a very quick overview of a lot of information.",12840.74,12849.0
"(12849.0, 12854.0)"," But within the plan itself, you know, we want to make this as action oriented as possible.",12849.0,12854.0
"(12854.0, 12875.4)"," And so we do include essentially a matrix that serves as an action plan and identifies the goals, champions, potential partners, the status, the costs, and target implementation for each of these actions identified as part of the two catalyst projects.",12854.0,12875.4
"(12877.1, 12886.96)"," So lastly, I wanted to end on just a few updates regarding the public review draft and our timeline for approval.",12877.1,12886.96

"(12966.4, 12973.44)", adoption this is adopted by ordinance there are five touch points there are three readings first,12966.4,12973.44
"(12973.44, 12977.36)", second and third reading the third reading is adoption first reading is just introduction,12973.44,12977.36
"(12978.0, 12985.18)", uh in between the the the those readings are two committee meetings and the committee is planning and sustainability.,12978.0,12985.18

"(13000.46, 13003.32)", And the timeframes historically have been different.,13000.46,13003.32
"(13003.32, 13004.5)"," So the city council,",13003.32,13004.5
"(13004.5, 13007.66)"," once we get the neighborhood board endorsements,",13004.5,13007.66

"(13010.52, 13013.58)", and adopted the plan within about three months.,13010.52,13013.58
"(13014.74, 13017.6)", So we were thinking that if we could notice,13014.74,13017.6
"(13017.6, 13021.48)"," the public hearing prior to us submitting it to council,",13017.6,13021.48
"(13021.48, 13024.32)", and then that the public hearing would then occur,13021.48,13024.32
"(13029.2, 13035.12)", such that in the in the first meeting we can say uh we gather input and then at the water commission public hearing we can,13029.2,13035.12
"(13035.68, 13041.6)", uh provide that input for the record and then we go to the city council second committee meeting,13035.68,13041.6
"(13042.24, 13046.72)", uh the the the input that we get at the water commission's public,13042.24,13046.72
"(13046.72, 13053.84)", hearing can then be made record uh of you know in the in the city council process um because what we,13046.72,13053.84
"(13054.88, 13060.64)", wanted we didn't want to what we wanted to do is get that interaction before the before the,13054.88,13060.64
"(13060.64, 13065.98)"," council adopts it as ordinance because once it's adopted as ordinance, it's hard to change.",13060.64,13065.98
"(13065.98, 13068.78)", So we want to ensure that there's interaction,13065.98,13068.78
"(13068.78, 13070.78)", and there's discussion there.,13068.78,13070.78
"(13070.78, 13072.54)"," And so after it's adopted by council,",13070.78,13072.54

"(13089.04, 13093.58)", And so if the staff feels that it's appropriate,13089.04,13093.58
"(13093.58, 13096.58)"," to notice the public hearing,",13093.58,13096.58

"(13103.46, 13105.84)", I think it took six months for the commission,13103.46,13105.84
"(13105.84, 13111.44)", because of the 90-day notice so i last the last time so anyway that's that's the approval process,13105.84,13111.44
"(13111.44, 13119.04)", and i think that's the last slide there um abby and we're available for questions if they're in,13111.44,13119.04
"(13120.32, 13135.12)", a little longer than we thought 30 minutes but that's okay commissioners commissioners any questions oh sorry go ahead um just a quick question given the uh what barry said about this,13120.32,13135.12
"(13135.12, 13142.0)", um east honolulu having the highest per capita water use and then in the east honolulu plan that,13135.12,13142.0
"(13142.0, 13146.9)", there wasn't um and i'm curious why there isn't more aggressive,13142.0,13146.9
"(13146.9, 13155.12)", reduction of per capita water use um because it's not aligning for me what Barry said and,13146.9,13155.12
"(13155.12, 13165.58)", what Abby said on the projected demand being um stable or decreasing. And then.,13155.12,13165.58
"(13165.58, 13168.62)"," Sorry, my words are not coming together.",13165.58,13168.62

"(13170.04, 13177.32)"," So basically, why is there not more aggressive reduction of per capita water use in the plan?",13170.04,13177.32
"(13177.32, 13182.96)", We were tying the reduction in per capita based on the amount of supply that we thought,13177.32,13182.96
"(13182.96, 13189.2)"," we would have. So what we did was in a water research foundation study,",13182.96,13189.2
"(13189.56, 13195.16)", we took the USGS recharge rates and,13189.56,13195.16
"(13196.2, 13198.4)", and applied that to the UH,13196.2,13198.4
"(13198.96, 13201.48)", 2100 forecast or rainfall forecast rate.,13198.96,13201.48
"(13202.16, 13205.96)"," One wet, one dynamical was wet, statistical was dry.",13202.16,13205.96
"(13205.96, 13209.0)", And then we calculated roughly,13205.96,13209.0
"(13209.0, 13212.36)", what the sustainable yields would be in both scenarios.,13209.0,13212.36
"(13212.36, 13215.4)"," So in the low, I mean, in the dry scenario,",13212.36,13215.4
"(13215.4, 13217.66)", the sustainable yields dropped,13215.4,13217.66
"(13217.66, 13220.92)", by something in the range of 30%.,13217.66,13220.92
"(13220.92, 13223.84)", And so reducing the amount of supply,13220.92,13223.84
"(13223.84, 13237.04)"," available to East Honolulu, we felt that bringing it down to 130 per capita would be sufficient for the demand to align with what we think the supply may be.",13223.84,13237.04
"(13237.12, 13247.44)"," Now, these are scenarios. It's 80 years away. There's going to be other evaluations of sustainable yield.",13237.12,13247.44
"(13249.36, 13253.2)", There are other cities that can go to 100 per capita.,13249.36,13253.2
"(13253.2, 13260.0)"," And in fact, when you see primary urban center, because of the density, we think we can go down to 100.",13253.2,13260.0
"(13260.28, 13267.06)"," But in East Honolulu, there's a lot of large properties, a lot of swimming pools out there, so it's harder to get it lower.",13260.28,13267.06
"(13267.8, 13273.38)"," But if you can get the golf course off the potable system and onto the recycled water, that'll do a lot there.",13267.8,13273.38
"(13274.22, 13280.48)"," Wildlife golf courses has their own well, but the effluent at the Hawaii Kaiwai Swart Treatment Plant is salty.",13274.22,13280.48
"(13280.9, 13283.92)"," You know, they have to desalinate that.",13280.9,13283.92
"(13284.16, 13285.28)", And the sea level rise it's,13284.16,13285.28
"(13285.28, 13291.92)", going to make it worse so it'll be challenging but we tied it to what we thought was the the,13285.28,13291.92
"(13291.92, 13301.6)", available supply okay so larry so basically your answer is that to east on the blue is that you're,13291.92,13301.6
"(13301.6, 13311.2)", only going to get a certain amount of water and you got to live with that that's why you're getting a decrease um yeah and and historically it has,13301.6,13311.2
"(13311.2, 13319.68)", been decreasing down from 190 the 170 is when we started to calculate the 2020 uh numbers um,13311.2,13319.68
"(13319.68, 13326.96)", they're actually at 170 now and so they can get a little bit lower with our rebates and stuff but that's,13319.68,13326.96
"(13326.96, 13331.28)", how we would do that rather than desalination because we're doing that you know in eva,13326.96,13331.28
"(13332.24, 13338.56)", so instead of increasing or augmenting the supply it's easier to just try to get their demand down,13332.24,13338.56
"(13338.56, 13347.76)", to what what we think would be available i got a question oh go ahead neil uh i couldn't go through the list of stakeholders,13338.56,13347.76
"(13347.76, 13353.28)", consulted fast enough to see what's coming schools on that list the largest private landowner,13347.76,13353.28
"(13353.92, 13359.04)", it should be yeah they they own the majority of the golf they own the golf courses that there,13353.92,13359.04
"(13359.04, 13370.96)", is that golf course uh lease renewal kind of part of their is that an assumption yes has there been discussion with,13359.04,13370.96
"(13370.96, 13375.36)", them to see if that's the highest and best use of that land in terms of their unique mission,13370.96,13375.36
"(13377.44, 13388.16)", um no we didn't talk about as far as i remember we didn't talk about changing or you know closing the golf course it was trying to supply with an alternative source,13377.44,13388.16
"(13390.4, 13394.64)", you might want to just broach the discussion with them i'm not saying it's an easy to it's an easy,13390.4,13394.64
"(13395.52, 13401.52)", uh there's a lot of reliance and acceptance of the golf course but given their mission what it,13395.52,13401.52
"(13401.52, 13406.68)", provides for their mission is fairly limited in relationship to the impact of this,13401.52,13406.68
"(13406.68, 13412.88)", being the largest water user in that area.,13406.68,13412.88
"(13412.88, 13418.7)"," And now granted, yeah, if they could get off potable, that would be helpful to this equation.",13412.88,13418.7
"(13418.7, 13426.2)"," But same token, that's a lot of land that might be, have a more powerful contribution to their mission",13418.7,13426.2
"(13426.2, 13427.44)", if redeployed.,13426.2,13427.44
"(13428.38, 13429.9)", I'm gonna be a little bit more candid,13428.38,13429.9
"(13429.9, 13431.74)", than my fellow commissioners.,13429.9,13431.74
"(13431.74, 13433.98)", And maybe because I'm tired.,13431.74,13433.98
"(13433.98, 13435.12)", It's been a long morning.,13433.98,13435.12
"(13435.12, 13436.32)"," Sorry, it took so long.",13435.12,13436.32

"(13437.48, 13440.7)"," It was extremely informative,",13437.48,13440.7

"(13443.8, 13452.16)"," You know, your, this report, it just emphasized the disparate treatment.",13443.8,13452.16

"(13986.08, 13992.88)", that is in some way redistributing yes we provide annual funding to because of act 152 and because,13986.08,13992.88
"(13992.88, 13998.64)", we created a stakeholder advisory group with folks like mark fox in there you know the big advocates,13992.88,13998.64

"(17336.64, 17349.38)", I think 2.5 mgd between 2 and 3 mgd and that is 100% of base base flow um historically it went all the way down to,17336.64,17349.38
"(17349.38, 17356.7)", the ocean yes how far down are those people with the agriculture lots um they're just,17349.38,17356.7
"(17356.7, 17373.84)", below uh waimea town not far i mean it's pretty high up maybe just one thing that this would be one of the only the streams that we potentially restore,17356.7,17373.84
"(17373.84, 17381.36)", mauka to makai from upolu to puna basically going to be the only perennial stream that this,17373.84,17381.36
"(17381.36, 17386.24)", commission could balance on and see full stream restoration or any space,17381.36,17386.24
"(17386.24, 17395.52)", flow restoration that supports um that type of ecological um support and why may our town has,17386.24,17395.52
"(17395.52, 17426.16)", no other source currently no they they they have two high elevation groundwater wells that could meet most of their needs. It's just cost. It's way cheaper to utilize surface. Recommendation number three regarding Department of Water Supply.,17395.52,17426.16
"(17426.16, 17434.76)", So what kinds of requirements do you have of them?,17426.16,17434.76
"(17434.76, 17440.68)", We just want them to be cooperative with USGS.,17434.76,17440.68
"(17440.68, 17447.24)", There isn't a specific requirement necessarily other than maybe don't adjust things during the day,17440.68,17447.24

"(17459.3, 17461.68)"," And the other second question I had is,",17459.3,17461.68
