other reasonable and beneficial uses of water is something that needs to be discussed and will come up more as we see less water availability in certain areas, impacts of climate change, what have you. The presentation also mentions that DHHL has approximately 15% of paper water, but there's more needed, so you're right. There is going to need to be more conversations about what those needs look like and ways that we can better collaborate not only with DHHL but with the counties to better understand how we can, if maybe the county has the ability to provide water to DHHL, how we spread out that duty of not just the infrastructure to make sure that DHHL uses have adequate supplies. Does that kind of answer your question or get at kind of the context of the presentation?

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: I think so and I want to have a little bit [inaudible] since it's an informational briefing, not an action item. Let me back up, when I started on the Commission in 2021 we were talking about Moloka‘i and Maui and there were some interesting proposals that I remember DHHL bringing up that were a bit more holistic than the normal permit applicant, about their investment, the recognition of scarce water, their interest in investing also in watershed protection. Maybe this is for Ayron, personally I don't view things as just a zero-sum game, some things are maxed out, but there's also room for innovation and I think some of that conversation had come up on Maui. I remember Commissioner Meyer brought up R1 and R1 use is coming up again. How do we slice the pie in equitable ways, but also try and innovate and expand on conserve? Sure, we deal with permits and allocation but what are the things we can also be supporting as a Commission as we think about the needs that are outstripping supply? Ayron, can you remind us again where are the spaces, where we need to focus some energy and attention on?

DR. STRAUCH: I will just comment about, DHHL has a reservation on the Big Island in the Māhukona aquifer system, but they have broader regional needs that can't just be met from the one aquifer. In developing an interim instream flow standard for Waikoloa Stream, for example, the South Kohala drinking water system, which diverts almost the entirety of Kohākōhau and Waikoloa Streams to provide for drinking water supply, the County's water system could be used to meet portable needs that may have originally been met with a reservation from groundwater. This is where we are considering establishing an instream flow standard to protect instream values, but then there are also other public trust uses that could be met or should be met with the same water essentially or from the same source, especially since the stream diversions that feed the system are on DHHL land. It's kind of a little bit full circle in that the resources that could be used to meet DHHL's needs should be in the consideration of the establishment of an action to protect the resource. I don't know if that answers your question or not.

COMMISSIONER MIIKE: I want to remind Commission members that another public trust purpose is domestic uses of the general public. That's never been tested. I assume that means public water supply systems, but public water supply systems also provide
