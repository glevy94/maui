Item B-2, and Item B-2 is approval of Stream Channel Alteration Permit Application, SCAP.5954  dash  well, 6, and special conditions.  
Do we have a staff presentation?  
Yep, Dean.  
Okay. Oh, Dean. Go ahead, Dean.  
Good morning, Commissioners. Dean Uyeno with the commission's Stream Protection and Management Branch, presenting on Item B-2. This is, as Chair mentioned, approval for  requesting approval of a Stream Channel Alteration Permit SCAP.5954.6 by the County of Maui Department of Public Works. The project proposes to restore a section of an embankment covering an area of approximately 5,000 square feet along the Wailuku River for flood protection purposes in the Millyard Light Industrial Subdivision at Wili Pa Loop, Wailuku, Maui. Commission staff stands by the submittal, and if I may, I'm just gonna read through the recommendations.   So Recommendation 1 is that the commission approve the Stream Channel Alteration Permit subject to the standard conditions in Exhibit 4 and the special conditions below. Condition 1A. In conformance with the County of Maui Planning Department's recommendations incorporated by reference in Exhibit 1, the permittee shall certify to the Maui Planning Department that no increase in base flood water surface  water  excuse me, base flood water surface elevation will occur. Item 1A. In conformance with the Division of Forestry and Wildlife recommendations incorporated by reference in Exhibit 2, the permittee shall avoid construction and operational impacts of state-listed species, minimize the movement of plant or soil material between work sites as they may contam  contain detrimental fungal pathogens such as rapid ohia death, vertebrate and invertebrate pests such as coqui frogs and little fire ants, or invasive plant parts such as miconia moling which could harm our native species and ecosystems. And consult  and lastly, consult with the Native  excuse me, Maui invasive species community to help plan, design, and construct the project, learn of any high-risk invasive species in the area and ways to mitigate their spread. Item 1C. In accordance with the proposal by the Maui Department of Public Works acknowledging the sensitivity of the project location, the permittee shall implement the following best management practices:- Limiting repair activities to one-half of the stream cross-section at a time.- Limiting construction work to what can be installed and stabilized by the end of the working day for areas within the ordinary high water mark.- Use of a plastic-lined sandbag coffer dam around the stream work area.- Use of silt fence above the ordinary high water mark around the construction access operating area and staging in stockpile areas.- Use of dust fences around the staging and stockpile area.- And lastly, sediment filtering & treatment for dewatering discharge. Item 1D. Issuance of the permit is subject to SHPD concurrence. If SHPD requires conditions, we'd delegate to the deputy director to attach those as conditions. Item 1E. The permittee shall ensure streamflow connectivity around the project site at all times, with no more than 50 percent of the stream channel width being diverted around the project area to enable fish passage. And lastly, Item 1F. To ensure coordination through the project, the permittee shall notify the Commission on Water Resource Management staff and representatives of Hui oNā Wai ʻEhā within one week of when the project is scheduled to start, any issues that may arise during the project work, and when the project is scheduled to be completed. And that concludes staff's presentation.
Thank you, Dean.
I believe  I believe we do have consult  the consultants for the project on the call.
Hi, good morning. Thank you, Dean. Thank you, Commissioners and Chair. My name is Gwendolyn Rivera. I'm with Munekiyo Hiraga. We're the consultants for the County of Maui on this project. Also on the call, we have Kristi Ono from the County of Maui Department of Public Works. We also have Mark Roy from Munekiyo. And from Austin Tsutsumi & Associates, the engineers, we have Adrienne Wong and Rick Evans to address any questions you may have.
All right, thank you. Commissioners, do you have any questions either for staff or for the consultant?
I do.
Yes.
So maybe this is for the engineers. I was just  in reviewing the Fish and Wildlife comments about kind of the  the hardening of the stream bank, I just was wondering if you could explain or recap your response on how this wouldn't. I was particularlyconcerned about the potential for downstream scour right below and is that an issue and why it's not, and how  how the design of the structures addresses that. So I'm not sure who the best person to  to respond would be. Maybe PE.
Yeah, I guess I can take that. I'm with Austin Tsutsumi, the civil engineer on this project. We  you know, it's not gonna speed up the flow beyond this  this bank. It's going to  just in the area where  where it interacts with the hardening, it'll  it'll accelerate in that area, but then we used a roughened grouted riprap edge so that it mitigates the velocity increase there, and we don't expect any increase in velocity downstream. And we did a hydraulic analysis throughout the area from upstream of the project through to downstream to verify those hydraulic conditions.
I think just  yeah, it just helps to know  how you guys have thought about it and considered, so thank you.
Any other questions or comments? Yes, Wayne.
Just a quick question. The 600 cubic yards that will be excavated, to meet the Forestry requests of minimizing the movement of soil, how would that be reused or recycled? Would it be on-site?
The 600 - 
cubic yards of excavation that's listed.
Yeah, so what  what's happened with the stream bank is it's eroded into a near  you know, it used to be at a  at a sloping embankment, and now it's eroded to a near vertical condition. And replacement without doing a vertical wall, which we wanted to avoid doing a wall, is  we sloped it at the maximum possible gradient that we could, and that is what's required in  bringing in a fill to sort of replace what  what has been lost from past erosion. Does that answer your question?
So, no. Well, the material that's being excavated, Forestry is concerned about vectoring pathogens, so would that material be reused in sort of reconstruction of the embankment, or are you gonna store it on site, or what's the  how are you going to handle that?
That is a  I would expect that the material wouldn't be removed from the site, that it would be  whatever is excavated would be reused on-site, so I don't  I'm not sure what the  how to better answer that.
Gwen, would you have anything to add on that one? It's more of a biological kind of question.
In terms of the  the placement of the excavated material?
Yes.
I guess, is it leaving the site?
Excavating. This is Kristi Ono with the County of Maui Department of Public Works. Given the concern, I'm sure within the area, we could find a use for that material, and it does not need to leave the site.
Yeah, it's not a lot. It's only 600 yards. So the plan is that you will reuse it somewhere backfilling in that area to address Forestry's concern?
Yes. If it's not appropriate material to reuse specifically for this project, I'm sure within the area of the Wailuku River, we can find a use for it as there are, you know, maintenance practices done nearby that could likely use material.
Okay, good. Thank you.
Any other questions or comments?(No response.)
Do I have any  those are the only people on the list. Do I have any other  Kathy, anybody else on the Zoom that is here to provide comments on Item B-2?
No.
Okay. Hearing no other comments, do I have a motion on this matter
So moved to approve.
The motion has been moved 
Second.
and seconded. A motion has been moved and seconded to approve Item B-2, the approval of the Stream Channel Alteration Permit. All in favor, please say aye.(Response.)
Any opposed?(No response.)
All right, thank you very much. The commission has approved Item B-2.
MOTION (KATAYAMA/KAGAWA-VIVIANI)  To approve B-2 as submitted.  UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED
So let's  you know, I'm going to take a five-minute break, and then we will come back to do Item B-3.(Pause in proceedings 10:00 a.m.-10:07 a.m.)
All right. (Gavel.) We're back in session. Thank you very much. We are going to go to Item B-2  B-3, B-3, B-3. approve Stream Channel Alteration Permit SCAP.5974.3 by Castle & Cooke Homes Hawai‘i Staff, is there 
Aloha and good morning again Commissioners.
