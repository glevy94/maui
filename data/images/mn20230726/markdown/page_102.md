Freshwater lens is pretty thick, so how far this might threaten wells further inland, we don't really know. Okay. So the one enigmatic occurrence that I'm gonna talk about today is the Schofield high-level groundwater. It's an area of high-level groundwater that's higher than you would expect from -- in a high-permeability aquifer. We know from data, groundwater data that it's not perched; it's saturated all the way down to sea level, and freshwater probably extends quite a bit below sea level. Many hydrologists have postulated some sort of a groundwater barrier, like a dam vertical structure that is supporting this, but the actual structure is not really known. Now, the -- probably the main consequence of taking water out of this is reduction of groundwater flow to adjacent aquifers, so, yeah, it will reduce the amount of water available in the adjacent aquifers.

Okay. So to quantify the consequences of the groundwater withdrawal for this study, we used groundwater models of Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, and Maui. These islands have most of the -- well, these islands have all of the principal hydrologic settings that we talked about before, so at least we can test them. We created calibrated models which had 2001 to 2010 conditions for pumping and recharge and land use, and so forth. So then we took this model, this calibrated model, and
