## P R O C E E D I N G S:

**CHAIR CHANG:** (Gavel.) Aloha mai kƒÅkou. My name is Dawn Chang, and I am chair of the Water Commission. Thank you very much for joining us today. This is the June 20th, 2023, meeting of the Commission on Water Resource Management. It is now 9:03. We are holding this meeting as a hybrid meeting; some of us are here in person -- actually, most of us -- in the Kalanimoku Building Boardroom in Honolulu, and we're also holding this meeting remotely via Zoom, and it can be watched live on YouTube.

For those who are here to testify on Zoom, we will let you into the meeting when we will be hearing the item you wish to testify on. Please remember to turn off your YouTube when you are in the main Zoom meeting room, or we will get an echo. When you enter, please be sure to keep your camera off, microphone muted, until the commission calls on you for your public testimony. We ask that members of the public testifying on agenda items limit your testimony to three minutes so that we can get to -- get to hear from everyone. And please remember not to use the chat for any comments because that presents a Sunshine issue. People may also testify via telephone at the number posted online. Please let our commission secretary know your name and what agenda item you are here to testify on. You can also email your testimony via email kathy.s.yoda@hawaii.gov or dlnr.cwrm@hawaii.gov.
