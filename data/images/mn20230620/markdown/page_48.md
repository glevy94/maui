Commissioners.

CHAIR CHANG: Good morning.

MR. UYENO: Item B-3, this is Dean Uyeno again with the Stream Protection and Management Branch presenting Item B-3. And this is requesting approval of the Stream Channel Alteration Permit, SCAP.5974.3, by Castle & Cooke Homes Hawaiâ€˜i, Incorporated. The project proposes to convey and discharge on-site stormwater runoff into Kipapa Stream that has been consolidated and treated in the Koa Ridge Stormwater Treatment Facilities. The proposed Drain Line 2, or DL2, is designed to accommodate the peak runoff from the second phase, which is the northern portion of the Koa Ridge Development. The drain line will be approximately 1600 feet in length and will consist of two box culverts that discharge into a 12-foot wide trapezoidal channel with articulated concrete blocks that terminates in a riprap channel lining and concrete rubble masonry stream bank protection at Kipapa Stream. A 10-foot by 8-foot box culvert would be constructed in Row G to connect to the upstream portion of Drain Line 2. And staff stands by its submittal.

And if I may just read the recommendation that the commission approve the Stream Channel Alteration Permit application that proposed to convey and discharge on-site stormwater runoff into Kipapa Stream that has been consolidated and treated in the Koa Ridge Stormwater Treatment Facilities.
