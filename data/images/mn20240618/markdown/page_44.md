- The work of staff who have diligently researched issues, consulted stakeholders and crafted policy-aligned recommendations for our consideration.
- Commissioners who draw upon their knowledge, experience and problem-solving tools to resolve disputes, balance beneficial interests and fulfill our duties.
- A humble perspective that elevates public trust considerations over our self-interests or the concerns of specific constituencies.

My reflections on our efforts to manage Hawai‘i’s cherished wai resources are in stark contrast to the adage that “whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting.” That might be what they do elsewhere, but I do not think that characterizes our philosophy over the past eight years. Nor do I believe it will help you as you tackle the work that lies ahead. By now, you should all have learned that conflict divides communities, impedes action, depletes natural resources and confounds financial viability. Our ancestral wisdom of ola i ka wai enlightens a more prudent path. Water is not something we should fight to own and control for our singular use. It is what we must sustainably manage to create the conditions we need to survive today and for generations to come.

I will miss the work of the Commission and I will miss all of you. Part of me would like to continue, but I also realize that our community is blessed with a deep bench of Hawaiian cultural practitioners who can bring insights and values that are essential to your future deliberations and efforts to uphold the principles of Hawai‘i’s Water Code. I hope the Governor expeditiously appoints a worthy successor with these qualities so that the Commission can “e pūpukahi i holomua kākou!” Mahalo nui and aloha nō!
