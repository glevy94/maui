MS. ROTH: -- to get to this point. I know that it's been a long process, and not all the parties have been satisfied. Unfortunately, I think that's just how it goes sometimes when you do outreach over many, many years. But yeah, I think the county might be able to comment a bit more about what impacts specifically not adopting the plan would have.

CHAIR CHANG: Okay, awesome.  
If there are no other questions, I'm going to invite the county to provide us comments.

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Very diplomatic.  
(Laughter.)  
CHAIR CHANG: Council Member Shane Sinenci, would you like to speak first?

COUNCIL MEMBER SINENCI: Okay. Aloha kākou and aloha, Chair Chang.

CHAIR CHANG: Aloha.  
COUNCIL MEMBER SINENCI: I'm happy to be -- aloha nō. I'm happy to be here in support of the commission's recommendations. We are supportive of the commission creating a summary of the report, and also we support having regular updates made to the plan, including the Board of Water Supply and the council's input. This will be important for community outreach and -- and just general awareness. We've heard loud and clear from the community that they want to see up-to-date information.
