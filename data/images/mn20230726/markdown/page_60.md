**CHAIR CHANGE:** Captain, excuse me. Oh, Captain, could you -- sorry. What's an SME? I'm not familiar.  
**CAPTAIN SULLIVAN:** A subject matter expert.  
**CHAIR CHANGE:** Okay, okay. Thank you.  
**CAPTAIN SULLIVAN:** Sorry. I apologize.  
**CHAIR CHANGE:** No. Sorry, sorry, sorry.  
**CAPTAIN SULLIVAN:** Yeah.  
**CHAIR CHANGE:** Go ahead.  
**CAPTAIN SULLIVAN:** So one of -- while it's much lower on the slide deck here, but what are we utilizing the data that we are getting for the monitoring wells? It is to also make sure and conduct modeling. So there are two parallel modeling efforts that we're proceeding with. We have both the Navy modeling effort where we're working with one of our contractors and have been for several years, and then there is an independent University of Hawai‘i modeling effort that we are supporting, giving them -- make sure they have all of our data, any access, and helping them in any way we can, but that is a parallel modeling effort the University of Hawai‘i is doing to, again, make sure we understand what's happening below the surface, where is the groundwater flowing.  

Another item I would like to talk about is, you know, we mentioned -- I think at the last CWRM there was some discussion on what are your current actions. The soil vapor extraction is a technology that we are proceeding with right now.
