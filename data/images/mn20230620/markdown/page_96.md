see that the combined 12-month moving average is 18.972 from 20.363 as of November of 2021.

So can they sustain running the system with one source? Yes. Is that a good idea? Probably not, because if Waiawa Shaft pulls down, they don't have water for their system.

The one thing that we -- we wanted to make sure that we looked at was chlorides -- and -- because chlorides give us an indication of aquifer health too. And so this is a plot of chlorides. So you'll see this scale is pumpage in million gallons per day. This scale is parts -- in terms of parts per million. So you see some variability. The orange dots are the chlorides, and you see some variability, but it's relatively -- pretty stable and pretty good at about maybe 130, 130 parts per million.

Waiawa Shaft is the one that I think we're really -- that we're a lot more interested in because as they increase pumpage from Waiawa Shaft to support the system, what does that tell us about the chlorides? Well, the chlorides -- I mean, this is -- it's relatively fresh water, right? Like between 35 and maybe a high of 44 parts per million. So we see -- we see some variability with respect to pumpage, but not too much.

That takes me through the Navy's water sources. Did you guys have any questions on that section before we move on?
