## Minutes

**DEPUTY AG LAU:** Then that becomes a non-action because it's conditional. What does that mean then?

**COMMISSIONER HO:** The other alternative is, we could go into executive section and seek the legal advice of our attorney now.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** But we’re still not done, it seems to me that there's enough hesitance that we're not going to make a decision today.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Okay, you're going to be here.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** Anyway if we can make a decision the next time around, then I'm okay waiting one month but boy these things are so dragging. Everything we're doing now gets dragged out. I thought we were a decisive Commission.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** The risk of somebody suing us because you're allowing more public process seems remote, but the real risk is if somehow the actions that we take to issue permits are then tainted by this confusion, then that affects some driller, some entity that's out there doing something that they think they have the authority to do, but then somebody questions whether that authority was correct.

I don't know, is the legal default position that everything that comes to the Commission has to be individually approved by the Commission? That sounds nuts that we had to actually vote on each and every one of them. That's no way to run a Commission.

**CHAIR CHANG:** No, you're right and I do think that there are frameworks upon which we can work the parameters and maybe that's what the AG's office can provide us guidance on, but I think in the past there has been no parameters. It has been a blanket delegation and that doesn't trigger rulemaking, but it triggers in my mind a tremendous
