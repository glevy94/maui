Protection and Management Branch. And at that time, I think that's -- that's all the staff that's present, Chair.

CHAIR CHANG: Thank you very much.

We also have present Deputy Attorney General Miranda Steed. Thank you, Miranda.

So with that, we do have an agenda. I don't believe we're taking anything out of order, Kathy, and we're going in the order of the agenda. Okay.

So, Commissioners, the first item on the agenda is Item A1. It is the approval of the minutes of June -- nope. It is the approval of the minutes of May 16th, 2023.

Is there any written testimony, Kathy, on this agenda item?

MS. YODA: No.

CHAIR CHANG: Okay. Anybody here in the public to testify?

(No response.)

CHAIR CHANG: I'm not seeing any.

Any comments or questions by the board members on the minutes of May 16th, 2023?

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: I just have minor correction of some acronyms and grammar.

CHAIR CHANG: Okay.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: So we'll be working on the words and then send it to Kathy.
