MS. BLUMENSTEIN: So for -- for Molokai, I'd say earliest March 2024 to be -- a draft plan to be presented to our board. We will brief the commission at the same time. The board has 180 days to review and provide their comments before we present a bill for an ordinance to our county council. This Maui plan took three years through county council, so I'm not guaranteeing how long that's gonna take.  
*(Laughter.)*  
MS. BLUMENSTEIN: You know, as soon as that's been adopted, then it'd be presented to the commission. And for Lanai, I would say, you know, a minimum of three years as well.  
MS. ROTH: And I will also mention that the Molokai Plan will be -- there will be a briefing (inaudible) group that are the consultants to the commission.  
COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Okay.  
MS. ROTH: So we are going to organize that.  
COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Great, that's great. Super, thank you.  
DEPUTY MANUEL: There -- just to add, there's going to be a bunch of planning components of the Hawai‘i -- parts of the Hawai‘i Water Plan coming to the commission. Oahu, we have a couple that the board wants to present on as well. We're trying not to have more than one per meeting because it's so thick and it's robust, and it is a planning document.
