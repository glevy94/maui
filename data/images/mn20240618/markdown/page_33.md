it seems that we're dependent on a lot of these plans from the county, Water Use and Development Plan to the Water Protection Plan. I mean all of these should be used and living plans and some of these things are like 10 years old.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** That is a requirement, it just doesn't get done on a timely basis.

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** Is there a process to do a better synchronization of these plans?

**KATIE ROTH:** It's definitely a comment we've heard before in terms of the updates to these various components of the Hawai‘i Water Plan and how to get them more in sync because as you mentioned, they should be communicating with one another and they're being referenced by each other. If you have one that’s outdated…

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** That's how decisions are being made by each of them.

**KATIE ROTH:** Exactly. As part of our update to the Hawaii Water Plan framework which I know we are a little delinquent in getting before you, that is something that we hope to address in that framework document to provide better guidance on how we do that.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** You’re the conductor.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** I think I remember that cascade of planning that gets done is like painting the Golden Gate Bridge. By the time you get to the end of it, you got to go back because the first part of it all changed.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** The last piece is always the timing piece.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** It falls off. It's a challenge, but I know folks do your best and what I'm hearing though is that you do your plans for 20-year horizon and so the new infusion which is a sentinel event of 600 billion and so forth that your chair was trying to leverage like crazy is not changing. I think you guys came in 2018 and we did your reservations on the basis of your current and foreseeable needs at 2018. That is fairly unchanged by the new event of having more money? Or now that you just have some money to implement more of the plans that you had or are you accelerating your plan?

**ANDREW CHOY:** Thank you for the question. I think it's a combination of both. It's accelerating the lands that we already have. To your point, our chairman has been very adamant about looking at adding new lands to our inventory, lands that are not far and remote like the original lands that we did receive. He's been looking at lands closer to infrastructure so that we can connect to the counties. To your point, like my colleagues in
