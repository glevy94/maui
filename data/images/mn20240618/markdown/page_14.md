Minutes  

permits go before the Commission, so in terms of transparency in public notice, there are two other layers or other types of processes that will do that. In particular for us to drill an exploratory well, Chapter 343, Section 5, when you use State or County funds or lands, we are required to do an environmental assessment prior to the well construction and that would disclose the environmental impacts as well as including archaeological, cultural, and Ka Pa‘akai analysis. I appreciate the fact that guidelines will be worked on for Ka Pa‘akai because they're really needed, I think they're a bit loose. Then you mentioned the bulletin, so there are probably other ways to notify the public and allow comment, but that's our testimony and thank you for the opportunity to provide supporting testimony and I'm available for any questions.

**KAWIKA UYEHARA, HAWAI‘I DEPARTMENT OF WATER SUPPLY:** Good morning Commissioners, Chair Chang - Kawika Uyahara, Deputy Department of Water Supply, County of Hawai‘i. Yes, we did submit testimony and submitted testimony in support of the staff's original submittal, but hearing some of the comments and discussion made today which is very informative, I just wanted to add a couple new comments for consideration. I guess first, if there is a revised submittal from staff then what we hope to be able to comment officially on that via the testimony process in regards to the item 1A, I believe, we recognize and acknowledge if it is a rulemaking decision or discussion that needs to occur between CWRM and the AG, we respect that. We'll let that go through that process. In regards to Keauhou, we also recognize and acknowledge the 2017 Non-designation decision, so we fully are in agreement with following those conditions, recommendations that came out of that decision and we will abide by that. Just to put in, to add to the Keauhou conversation and we do have at least one, I think, well construction permit or application in process right now with CWRM staff and it's kind of been in the process for a couple years from what I remember. Basically, it's helping us to develop another source to reduce or to actually allow us to get off of using the basal lens sources such as Kahalū‘u shaft and some of the other basal wells that we have in the aquifer. Again, we know there's a process, we just want to make sure that everyone understands. On our side, we're trying to develop some sources just to replace some of the older basal sources so we can reduce our reliance on basal. In addition, some of you folks may know that we're trying to downsize some of our wells just so we have better operations, we can operate a little bit better with reliability. But that, we lose capacity in some of our wells. One of the well construction applications we have in now is to kind of help us restore some of that capacity that we've lost but thank you for the time and the time to provide comments, thank you.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** After listening to this, I have a question for Ryan. I'm trying to remember if it came up in December, but how are we addressing that bifurcation of what happens in the designated versus non-designated? Honolulu BWS’ testimony reminded me what they confront procedurally is a little bit different. I know there's a flowchart, but does that change with this decision?
