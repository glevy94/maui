Those that -- that presentation included an overview of some of the major themes and concerns that were raised during public testimony as well as staff's recommendations and responses to those concerns. The submittal you have before you includes the same items. That begins on page 7, and then the staff recommendation on page 11 includes the underlying items that you'll see.

I wanted to highlight that after the March 21st presentation, there was additional outreach done by staff with DWS, Maui County, and members of the Haiku community. That was in response to certain items and themes that were identified. We really wanted to make sure that we addressed them sufficiently so that we could come to you today with recommendations and an item that you felt comfortable approving, knowing that we had done our due diligence and additional outreach. So some of the recommendations you see have been tweaked slightly based on those conversations with certain stakeholders and the county.

I guess at this time, I would just say that staff believes that the plan itself meets all the statutory requirements set forth in the State Water Code, and it sufficiently addresses the recommended elements in the Hawaiâ€˜i Water Plan framework pertaining to updates of the County Water Use and Development Plan. So we feel that the plan you see today is sufficient and meets every -- all of the requirements.
