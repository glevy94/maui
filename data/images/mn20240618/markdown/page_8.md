Minutes  

**COMMISSIONER MIKE:** I really don't like what's happening here which is we're starting to get into such details of a delegation that it's going to be meaningless. The other thing is that I don't know of any bar that says we have to, if we're going to delegate, we have to delegate absolutely. We're only talking about delegating part of a decision making or a way of looking at things. I think it's irrelevant that we have to carve out exceptions and then we have to maybe look at rulemaking when we talk about delegation. When we want to delegate, we're going to delegate and I don't see any problems with delegating authority. Again, as I say, I'm concerned if we get into too much detail about what we're delegating, I'm fine with the language here and from the presentation that was given, the explanation is satisfactory to me.  

**CHAIR CHANG:** Let me ask you, Ryan, did you consult with the Attorney General's office on this matter?  

**RYAN IMATA:** No, but, Colin, I think you guys did review the submittal and I was trying to make sure that anything that was delegated wasn't - how do I say this? The delegation is for approval, so there's some discretion in what's delegated, but I was trying to take out the discretion so that I was being very specific about which things get delegated. Again, I can't comment on the legality of that, but I think if the Commission approved the specificity with which things have to go back to the Commission...I wasn't aware that that was a legal issue.  

**PUBLIC TESTIMONY**  

**ROY HARDY:** I'm here, thank you. Good morning Chair, aloha Commissioners. For the record my name is Roy Hardy, formerly Groundwater Protection manager for the Water Commission. I didn't really want to get into too much detail. I know I only got three minutes, but I was very happy to hear the discussion that the Commission was going through primarily about the issue of is this rulemaking or not. Just a little bit of background of some of the statements that were made and questions that were asked. Kagawa-Viviani brought up, I didn't even know, 40 times that delegation was mentioned in the 2004 Hawai ªi Construction Standards. The 1997 and 2004 updates, there was a lot of public information meetings, meetings with the public, meetings with all the drillers. There were presentations at conferences all about these things and there was a lot of input. These took years to arrive at, these details, there are a lot of them, very complex. Some of the examples I was reading through in the submittal about this cross connection issue, it sounds like it's something new, it isn't. It's addressed already in the construction standards. Saltwater wells need to be solid casing all the way down to saltwater and grouted all the way through the freshwater to protect the basal aquifer. Similarly, if there's cross connections with perched aquifers while you're going down the fine basal aquifers, that needs to be closed off and those are in the sections of casing and grouting, as well. I was a little bit scratching my head on that, but all the details aside, it seems like and I
