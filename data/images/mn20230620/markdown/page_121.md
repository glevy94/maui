people the same thing.

So I don't have any suggestions, but I think it has changed the way we'll be doing hearings forever now, and maybe there's ways to make it more efficient. Somehow having the testifiers know what other people are testifying so they can consolidate. Maybe pre-recording public testimony so people have a chance -- I haven't really thought that through, but we know these hybrid meetings are a way of the future, and we have to deal with that.

And then finally, wherever we can, if we can do larger geographical areas, you know, and look at the difference between the East Maui decision -- and I go back to Kaua‘i, Wai‘ale‘ale, where we were stuck with one stream because of a time limit on an application to the Board of Land and Natural Resources. There's more water in that drainage than any other drainage in the whole state, and if we would have an ability -- I think we're trying -- to really look at a larger geographical area, we can deal with the ecosystem issues, we can deal with the balancing that we need to do between our public trust priorities. And so wherever we can -- sometimes we're stuck with having to deal with a stream, but any way we can combine that within the larger area. And I think East Maui was a classic example where really we had a clean pallet for almost the first time to really implement the Water Code because we had 27 streams, we had really enough
