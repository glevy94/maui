mgd.

So the following three slides are just an indication -- and this is kind of -- it's a little bit -- I don't want to be misleading about it because it's hard to tell by the scale. Right? If we're looking at the scale of this, this is really just 0.8 million gallons per day. So we're seeing -- we saw a decrease in -- in time series of the 12-month moving average from about -- so we -- so the graphs I'm providing you are from 2020 to the present, and you see a reduction of Aiea -- they basically took Aiea-Halawa Shaft offline. I think they were pumping it for some testing purposes or whatever.

Red Hill Shaft -- let's see. So I think since -- I can't remember the date, but they started pumping Red Hill Shaft in order to induce like a plume -- plume containment situation.

Is that right, Commissioner Seto? 

And -- so they exceeded their allocation. Of course, you know, the allocation that the commission issued was -- was for consumptive purposes, but they converted Red Hill Shaft over to pumping it for plume containment. So you'll -- again, I don't want -- I don't want this to be sort of -- well, you can see. I mean, it's a -- it was about -- above their allocation. Maybe they -- they peaked by about 0.2 mgd at one point and then started stepping down their pumpage of Red Hill Shaft.
