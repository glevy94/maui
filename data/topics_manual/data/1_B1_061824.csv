Determination and Approval of Draft Agenda by the Commission on Water Resource Management Under Section 92-3.1, HRS, for the Commission to Conduct a Site Visit to Privately-owned Lands to View the Punalu‘u Stream Restoration Project Kamehameha Schools, Punalu‘u Stream, Punalu‘u, O‘ahu, Hawai‘i on June 27, 2024, as a Limited Meeting, due to the Impracticability of Public Attendance for Reasons of Danger to Health or Safety, or in the Alternative, that On-Site Inspection is Necessary for Future Stream Management Purposes
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Deputy Dean Uyeno Before it may conduct a site visit as a Sunshine Law limited meeting, the Commission must determine by 2/3 vote that the site inspection is necessary to Commission business, and that public attendance is not practicable. The proposed site visit is for the Punalu‘u Stream Restoration Project currently being undertaken by Kamehameha Schools on Punalu‘u Stream in Punalu‘u, O‘ahu, Hawai‘i.
Thank you for the accommodation and the long memory. This goes way back. Please don’t just do this for me. I think this is a really amazing project and Kamehameha stepped up in a big way. We created the plans, but the heavy lifting was done after I retired and to the credit of the team there and their trustees who made that investment to restore a system to what it should be. The abuses of the past in terms of really optimizing certain other values other than the value of the ecosystem there and the stream functions there itself, came at a high cost. That created great risk to the environment as well as to financial interests there, the homes that constantly got flooded and so forth. We’ve done that elsewhere, that’s happened elsewhere and so we thought this would be a model or example to, what can you do? Can you go back and can you restore? I just thought it would be a worthy example for the Commission to review. Thank you.
I’ll just say I remember before the restoration project, I was working part-time with SWCA with John Ford and Bob Kinzie, who has recently passed. Walking the stream - was like a highway - discussing the flooding issues. I’ve been out there and I think it’s a really good opportunity to be on site.
Chair, can I add that because the title is determination of approval for the limited meeting, may we ask that the approval include approval of the proposed agenda?
