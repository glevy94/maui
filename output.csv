"(1102.8, 1108.48)", I'm the Luna Alakai Executive Director for the hawaii state ahamoku i'd like,1102.8,1108.48
"(1108.48, 1118.16)", to say aloha to me we've known each other a long time um i will keep my testimony short because i,1108.48,1118.16
"(1118.16, 1125.44)", know i press for time uh we stand on our written testimony and this is with the advice and knowledge of the eight,1118.16,1125.44
"(1126.08, 1135.04)", po'o for the eight islands in the pai aina who represent 46 traditional moku and 606,1126.08,1135.04
"(1135.68, 1145.52)", traditional ahupua'a their boundaries are designated by the geography and the topography of the area.,1135.68,1145.52
"(1145.52, 1152.14)"," So in my testimony there, we noted just four specific things I just wanted to briefly touch",1145.52,1152.14
"(1152.14, 1153.14)", on.,1152.14,1153.14
"(1153.14, 1160.28)", And the first one is there is a list of the Pai Island that so you have a better idea,1153.14,1160.28
"(1160.28, 1166.32)", of the scope of the water commission and their responsibility to the native hawaiian,1160.28,1166.32
"(1167.28, 1173.44)", community on the islands so that's just so that you have a better idea of what that is,1167.28,1173.44
"(1174.24, 1180.88)", the next thing that i have in the packet is the resolution from the association of hawaiian civic,1174.24,1180.88
"(1180.88, 1187.44)", clubs that was passed in november of 2022 at convention in seattle washington,1180.88,1187.44
"(1188.08, 1194.08)", there were 67 clubs that were represented the delegates for those clubs and there was a,1188.08,1194.08
"(1194.64, 1206.64)", unanimous support for kalaya manuel to continue as the deputy director for the water commission then the third thing i wanted to just remind the,1194.64,1206.64
"(1206.64, 1213.44)", commission is of the osha wealth issues and has been going on for the past two three years now,1206.64,1213.44
"(1214.16, 1221.76)", and what's really significant about that is that kaleo is the one that looked at the wishes of the,1214.16,1221.76
"(1221.76, 1227.38)", people that would ask the developer if they're going to drill a well or if,1221.76,1227.38
"(1227.38, 1234.82)", they're going to pull the water from any of our streams or anything they would have to talk to,1227.38,1234.82
"(1234.82, 1242.32)", the people the Native Hawaiian communities of that place they would have to look at the impact that,1234.82,1242.32
"(1242.32, 1247.92)", that amount of water has been drawn out on the practitioners and I don't only,1242.32,1247.92
"(1247.92, 1254.94)", talk about the Mahi'a of the La Bahia but the deep ocean because the water that comes out into the,1247.92,1254.94
"(1254.94, 1268.88)", ocean impacts the practices and that's usually not looked at the other important thing about that issue is that mr deputy kaleo has asked that each developer give,1254.94,1268.88
"(1268.88, 1276.48)", back to the watershed that gives us the water that we need and that has never been done before,1268.88,1276.48
"(1277.2, 1286.8)", so that is very much appreciated the last thing i wanted to touch on is the kapa'a ka'i'a supreme court law that was,1277.2,1286.8
"(1286.8, 1296.72)", passed in the year 2000 and um deputy kalil manuel has made it a point that anyone that is applying,1286.8,1296.72
"(1296.72, 1306.36)", for a well a stream diversion or any kind of impact on the public waters of the public trust follows the findings of that conclusions of law,1296.72,1306.36
"(1306.36, 1315.42)", of the kapaa'akai supreme court and that has given open the door to our own people in a way that,1306.36,1315.42
"(1315.42, 1327.44)", we've all been looking for for many many years so that is happening because of that the hawaii state alhamdul strongly supports kaleo manuel as his,1315.42,1327.44
"(1327.44, 1334.32)", deputy director and um we hope to keep them so thank you thank you very much,1327.44,1334.32

"(1956.8, 1962.02)"," tracks water issues closely, I've really scrutinized his work over the last four years",1956.8,1962.02
"(1962.02, 1970.98)", and have been impressed not simply with his grasp of the issues but by his integrity and aloha and how as a process person he brings so much to,1962.02,1970.98
"(1970.98, 1976.86)", this commission I think as as former commissioner Beamer just pointed out but you know you've already,1970.98,1976.86
"(1976.86, 1981.0)", heard a lot from folks and as Isaac said we need him to get back to work so I had just a couple,1976.86,1981.0
"(1981.0, 1987.02)"," things that I wanted to highlight in his his first term, he implemented some important changes.",1981.0,1987.02
"(1987.34, 1991.46)", I think having issues presented for discussion at one commission meeting and then decision,1987.34,1991.46
"(1991.46, 1996.88)", making at a second has really helped the commission and all affected stakeholders be able to engage,1991.46,1996.88
"(1996.88, 2001.3)"," in meaningful discussion without, you know, the fear of contested case hearing kind of",1996.88,2001.3

"(2016.32, 2020.8)", incredibly important work and incredibly complicated work i mean you folks know you were,2016.32,2020.8
"(2020.8, 2030.48)", we were working side by side but i think it was i cannot say enough about how important kaleo's role was as a facilitator to bring together all the different entities,2020.8,2030.48
"(2030.48, 2037.12)", not just within commission staff aaron and others but also folks throughout dlnr and that was really,2030.48,2037.12
"(2037.12, 2043.28)", crucial in helping us to leverage resources and to make meaningful changes not just before with,2037.12,2043.28

"(2050.96, 2055.12)", so you know others have also mentioned what an important bridge he's been and how now we can,2050.96,2055.12
"(2055.12, 2061.52)", have meaningful two-way discussion you know not just one-way sort of directives um kalel has also,2055.12,2061.52
"(2061.52, 2075.02)"," had the courage to uphold the law and the commission's processes, and that has garnered some grousing, but I think as an attorney, I think that that better protects this commission and has reduced the number of appeals that we've seen during his term, at least compared to others.",2061.52,2075.02
"(2075.16, 2087.28)"," So I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I think you see, I strongly support his reappointment, and I want to urge all of you folks to vote and support. Thank you so much. And I'm happy to take any questions you may have.",2075.16,2087.28

"(2784.82, 2787.04)", the picking of Khalil for the position.,2784.82,2787.04
"(2788.16, 2794.64)", I met him way back before he even got into with the state and he has always been honest,2788.16,2794.64
"(2794.64, 2801.84)", and truthful. Something that in my experience is somewhat rare in government nowadays.,2794.64,2801.84

"(2808.08, 2812.46)", And I just wanna say I support Kaleo as the pick.,2808.08,2812.46
"(2812.46, 2816.18)"," And yeah, and I hope you guys pick him.",2812.46,2816.18
"(2816.18, 2817.02)", Thank you.,2816.18,2817.02
"(2818.26, 2819.44)", All right.,2818.26,2819.44
"(2819.44, 2820.94)"," Thank you, Keahi.",2819.44,2820.94

"(2851.0, 2866.08)"," And like I believe Professor Sproat and Mr. Moriwaki, I'm part of the folks who who've been here for a couple three decades already and so not only was I here when Kaleo was",2851.0,2866.08

"(2871.6, 2876.96)", then at one point I was actually in that seat and the person before that and so I think I,2871.6,2876.96
"(2876.96, 2888.24)", the thing I just want to share other than to kākou and echo the long support that we've heard today for Kāle'o is how different it is.,2876.96,2888.24
"(2890.04, 2908.9)"," With respect to those who have come before, commissioners and deputies, this has been a body that has been deeply hostile to local communities and Hawaiian communities. The fact that you have all these voices coming from across the pipeline,",2890.04,2908.9
"(2908.9, 2914.68)"," say hey, we actually recognize what you do. And we support what you do. And we don't always",2908.9,2914.68

"(2928.0, 2941.0)"," Not everybody has been happy during Kaleo's time, but I think that's also because it's not that conflict didn't exist before, but it was suppressed.",2928.0,2941.0
"(2941.0, 2947.0)"," Voices were suppressed, issues were suppressed, and we know what happens when that happens for too long.",2941.0,2947.0
"(2947.0, 2964.0)", So by bringing up a process where many entities now feel at least they have the opportunity to come before this really important board and have a fair hearing will make our lives and Hawaii so much better.,2947.0,2964.0
"(2964.0, 2965.76)", Mahalo nui.,2964.0,2965.76

"(3087.66, 3090.32)", because Kaleo has done an unbelievable job,3087.66,3090.32
"(3090.32, 3092.9)", in managing the Water Commission.,3090.32,3092.9
"(3092.9, 3095.4)", I am so happy for the state of Hawaii.,3092.9,3095.4
"(3095.4, 3097.3)"," I mean, we've heard a lot of descriptions",3095.4,3097.3

"(3131.28, 3137.52)", memories that he will always cherish so i'm incredibly happy for kaleo as well and i'm 100,3131.28,3137.52
"(3138.16, 3146.64)", in support of his reappointment thank you thank you very much mr buck neil yes uh first of all i want to thank the testifiers,3138.16,3146.64
"(3146.64, 3151.44)", who came forward took time from your day to to be here and be a part of the process and for all that,3146.64,3151.44
"(3151.44, 3157.84)", you uh shared in regard to largely in support of kalel uh i acknowledge the testimony of charlie,3151.44,3157.84
"(3157.84, 3166.0)"," ice uh in opposition and appreciate charlie's courage steps, stepping forward and extending his views.",3157.84,3166.0
"(3166.0, 3176.0)", And we have certainly a strong upwelling of support from our Hawaiian community and grassroots of our supporters of our culture and our environment.,3166.0,3176.0
"(3176.0, 3189.02)"," But I also appreciated the testimony Mike Atherton as a developer, who's trying to restore agriculture and other uses in a balanced way. And I think that his testimony was real key",3176.0,3189.02
"(3189.04, 3192.3)", and important element of support,3189.04,3192.3
"(3192.3, 3194.52)", for your continuation in this position.,3192.3,3194.52
"(3195.92, 3198.62)"," When I first met, I met Kaleo a long time ago,",3195.92,3198.62
"(3198.62, 3200.2)"," but when he first came into this position,",3198.62,3200.2
"(3200.2, 3202.28)", I met with him in his office,3200.2,3202.28
"(3202.28, 3203.68)", and we talk about this all the time.,3202.28,3203.68
"(3203.68, 3210.96)", And I saw this number of halavai on the on his whiteboard and it was the number of meetings he would have in his term,3203.68,3210.96
"(3210.96, 3217.76)", of this commission and in a recognition that everyone that passed without productive outcome,3210.96,3217.76
"(3217.76, 3224.48)", was a lost opportunity and that is a profoundly important attribute of a public servant who's,3217.76,3224.48
"(3224.48, 3225.92)", trying to work especially,3224.48,3225.92
"(3225.92, 3232.4)", in this area where so much needs to be done for such a vital resource so that attitude i think was,3225.92,3232.4
"(3232.4, 3239.2)", uh was telltale and it's one thing to want to get work done it's another thing to get the work done,3232.4,3239.2
"(3239.2, 3265.92)"," and the unprecedented results that we've seen in in submittal chair as well as in other testimony, I think, testifies to the fact that it's not only a matter of wishing things can happen but actually an ear to people who didn't feel like they had one before and we've",3239.2,3265.92
"(3265.92, 3272.32)", provided opportunities to really kind of work out the differences so that we have a framework,3265.92,3272.32
"(3272.32, 3276.96)", for how to move forward not only to protect the resource not only perpetuate the culture,3272.32,3276.96
"(3276.96, 3281.76)", but also to provide for development of agricultural or other urban uses in a way that's,3276.96,3281.76
"(3281.76, 3285.04)", very compatible with those goals and outcomes that's balance,3281.76,3285.04
"(3286.0, 3292.48)", and i think it's important duty of this this uh this uh commission i think the team is not only,3286.0,3292.48
"(3292.48, 3300.48)", kaleo but this team is doing a remarkable job in in achieving that and i recognize that as a new,3292.48,3300.48
"(3300.48, 3306.24)", administration steps in there's a desire to kind of eagerly bring your team in and i,3300.48,3306.24
"(3306.24, 3310.96)", appreciate that governor green has uh recognized that some members of the team that came before,3306.24,3310.96
"(3311.6, 3318.32)", were really valuable attributes uh and other really deserve recognition for what they've done,3311.6,3318.32
"(3318.32, 3327.2)", in the past and are going to be valuable in his administration going forward in continuing progress and achieving greater results,3318.32,3327.2
"(3328.0, 3333.2)", so for these reasons i've seconded the motion and uh eagerly await uh not only the approval of this,3328.0,3333.2
"(3333.2, 3346.64)", motion but also the months ahead and i think about having about a year and a half work we've done wow mahalo for that new um commissioners yes um,3333.2,3346.64
"(3352.88, 3360.48)", i just wanted to add in um it's with great relief that i heard um deputy manual,3352.88,3360.48
"(3361.04, 3366.48)", is going to be reappointed and would have a second chance um sorry i should have script this,3361.04,3366.48
"(3368.48, 3376.48)", but i i'm the newest person on the commission and it was um it was a very eye-opening experience to,3368.48,3376.48
"(3376.48, 3381.36)", realize how much of the work of this commission really happens between the meetings and so that's,3376.48,3381.36
"(3381.92, 3389.0)"," the deputy and staff working together to really organize information and provide it to us, so we can make informed decisions.",3381.92,3389.0
"(3389.0, 3398.0)"," With that, as testifier, the post broke, pointed out the informational briefs that precede decision making have been really helpful.",3389.0,3398.0
"(3398.0, 3405.0)", They're super dense it's helpful to have that lead time to really wrap our brains around these complicated issues.,3398.0,3405.0
"(3405.0, 3415.0)"," And we had the I had the opportunity I don't know if this is normal, but to get out to East Molly, for instance, to walk and really see these areas that we're making some decisions on.",3405.0,3415.0
"(3415.0, 3419.0)", We can't always go out there it's hard logistically with sunshine laws.,3415.0,3419.0
"(3419.0, 3427.28)", But you know it was facilitated by deputy and staff and i've seen him allow his staff to take lead,3419.0,3427.28
"(3428.16, 3434.64)", on different issues aaron on streams ryan imanta on red hill and really take the long view on many,3428.16,3434.64
"(3434.64, 3438.96)", things including we've had conversations about capacity building we all know seaworm doesn't,3434.64,3438.96
"(3438.96, 3445.8)", have enough staff and money to do all that it should and wants to do. So how do we take the long view?,3438.96,3445.8
"(3445.8, 3448.48)"," And so that's somebody not looking at a four-year term,",3445.8,3448.48
"(3448.48, 3450.46)", but really with the long-term,3448.48,3450.46
"(3450.46, 3452.74)", kind of intergenerational interests in mind.,3450.46,3452.74
"(3452.74, 3454.3)"," And so alongside with that,",3452.74,3454.3
"(3454.3, 3456.34)", we've had conversations about climate change.,3454.3,3456.34
"(3456.34, 3461.12)", How do we better think about climate change,3456.34,3461.12
"(3461.12, 3462.96)", in the context of our decision-making,3461.12,3462.96
"(3462.96, 3464.46)", than that played into Lahaina.,3462.96,3464.46
"(3464.46, 3466.0)", So there i'm,3464.46,3466.0
"(3466.0, 3472.16)", relieved that we can continue the work because these are challenging but um under coleos,3466.0,3472.16
"(3473.2, 3479.68)", as people have noted his facilitation skills um are impressive and humbling um,3473.2,3479.68
"(3480.48, 3489.0)", i don't know how to learn those or how to create more people who have those skills who can really leverage them in public service.,3480.48,3489.0
"(3489.0, 3494.0)"," It's not easy to be an agent of the State, especially working in community where there's been so much distrust.",3489.0,3494.0
"(3494.0, 3505.34)", So I really respect the report he's built and especially as I was on the Red Hill permitted interaction group have seen what happens when we break trust with institutions and how,3494.0,3505.34
"(3505.34, 3512.42)", harmful that is for really taking care of our water so um with that appreciate the stamina,3505.34,3512.42
"(3512.42, 3519.26)", that you you will bring you bring you will find in the coming years and and looking forward to,3512.42,3519.26
"(3519.26, 3525.34)", um I fully support your nomination and I'm looking forward to continuing the important work ahead,3519.26,3525.34
"(3525.34, 3527.34)", and complicated work.,3525.34,3527.34

"(3537.24, 3540.18)"," Thank you, Chair.",3537.24,3540.18
"(3540.18, 3550.24)", And I think Kahlil's accomplishments over his tenure as deputy has been well documented and described by oral testimony as well as written testimony.,3540.18,3550.24
"(3551.0, 3567.76)"," And for me, I think this is an interesting unique situation, and if you could provide some historical perspective, my first question is um i don't think any agency in the state other than the water commission has a",3551.0,3567.76
"(3567.76, 3576.08)", deputy and the chair to be confirmed by two different bodies and i was wondering you know,3567.76,3576.08
"(3576.08, 3585.9)"," how does the relationship work with the chair being temporary and the department deputy being confirmed,",3576.08,3585.9
"(3585.9, 3587.72)", should that not run in tandem.,3585.9,3587.72
"(3587.72, 3591.4)", But let's put that aside for the moment.,3587.72,3591.4
"(3591.4, 3595.3)", And I think it's a very powerful situation,3591.4,3595.3
"(3595.3, 3597.82)", that we have a resident deputy,3595.3,3597.82
"(3597.82, 3602.42)", that's being nominated again.,3597.82,3602.42
"(3602.42, 3612.3)"," And I guess Mr. Ice's testimony, has that been vetted?",3602.42,3612.3

"(3632.4, 3649.42)", And I don't know if that was ever articulated in the narrative that was presented as well as the resume I you know all the big stuff for the future Outlook I agree with because I was there,3632.4,3649.42
"(3649.42, 3659.44)", for most of it but also we do have a fiduciary responsibility to mandate things that we need to,3649.42,3659.44
"(3659.44, 3667.68)", interface with the public in terms of well permits or other kinds of administrative things so,3659.44,3667.68
"(3667.68, 3670.96)", i was wondering has that been vetted,3667.68,3670.96
"(3676.32, 3689.14)", that's sort of my you know sort of big areas that do we need to talk about it a little more?,3676.32,3689.14
"(3692.48, 3693.92)"," Oh, Commissioner, they are all a question.",3692.48,3693.92
"(3697.66, 3701.28)"," And as I first off, I just want to say mahalo to the community that has come to support my nomination and as well as the commissioners",3697.66,3701.28
"(3701.76, 3703.86)", and staff that are here.,3701.76,3703.86
"(3703.86, 3706.96)", And I think the question is tied to that,3703.86,3706.96
"(3706.96, 3715.36)", um on in terms of internal management and staff management and resources um you know i've i've,3706.96,3715.36
"(3716.0, 3722.16)", been i i know what it's like to come in as staff i used to work for department of wine homelands,3716.0,3722.16
"(3722.16, 3727.14)"," as staff and the changes administration every four, sometimes shorter if they don't last.",3722.16,3727.14
"(3728.7, 3746.24)"," And so continuity is really important, and so I will say in my defense, you know I've always come in working within the systems that have been created. but constantly asking questions about efficiency and how can we do things smarter with less",3728.7,3746.24
"(3746.24, 3753.44)", resources um take advantage of opportunities when we see them uh so a lot of the internal,3746.24,3753.44
"(3753.44, 3758.56)", dialogues that we have with staff and i'm hopefully eventually some of them will talk,3753.44,3758.56
"(3758.56, 3767.88)", to you one-on-one um or have the freedom to do that right right? And I encourage staff to share their thoughts with me,3758.56,3767.88
"(3767.88, 3771.76)"," and we've constantly had great conversations, I believe.",3767.88,3771.76
"(3772.72, 3773.88)"," We don't always agree,",3772.72,3773.88
"(3773.88, 3775.86)", but I'm always willing to listen to staff,3773.88,3775.86
"(3775.86, 3779.34)", and look at ways that we can improve our systems.,3775.86,3779.34
"(3779.34, 3781.32)"," And so with that said, you know,",3779.34,3781.32
"(3781.32, 3784.44)"," some of the criticism in Mr. Ice's letter,",3781.32,3784.44
"(3784.44, 3787.52)", I was unaware of um we process or,3784.44,3787.52
"(3787.52, 3793.36)", i process permits well construction compensation permits as they're presented to me um i take every,3787.52,3793.36
"(3793.36, 3799.68)", signature i put on a piece of paper very very seriously and most of my staff can attest to that,3793.36,3799.68
"(3799.68, 3812.5)", they probably get things sent back to them if there's even just a typo because I want it to be as perfect as it can be. That's the type of person I am and the commitment to quality that I'm,3799.68,3812.5
"(3812.5, 3819.88)"," committed to. So, you know, I worked with his supervisor and his supervisor would work",3812.5,3819.88
"(3819.88, 3831.52)", with me. And so we worked through some of the issues especially related to construction pump installation permits uh that we've reviewed so um again my commitment is just to be as good,3819.88,3831.52
"(3831.52, 3839.2)", as i can uh be an open door for staff to work with and you know as my kumu talked about in her,3831.52,3839.2
"(3839.2, 3846.0)", running her halal um you as a leader aren't as good as your team. And I believe in every single one of my team members,3839.2,3846.0
"(3846.0, 3848.7)"," and the staff that are here today,",3846.0,3848.7
"(3848.7, 3850.78)", because I cannot lead them.,3848.7,3850.78
"(3850.78, 3851.9)", They really support me.,3850.78,3851.9
"(3851.9, 3853.16)", And actually I support them.,3851.9,3853.16
"(3853.16, 3854.62)", I do believe I support them.,3853.16,3854.62
"(3854.62, 3856.08)", I've uplifted them.,3854.62,3856.08
"(3856.08, 3859.38)", A lot of the credit that's been given to me,3856.08,3859.38
"(3859.38, 3861.58)", is actually credit that should be given to them,3859.38,3861.58
"(3861.58, 3862.96)", because a lot of the initiatives,3861.58,3862.96
"(3862.96, 3864.7)"," and the work that's been presented,",3862.96,3864.7
"(3871.84, 3872.48)", they've been working on but really have never gotten to the agenda or have never been prioritized,3871.84,3872.48
"(3878.96, 3885.0)", um and so that's just my response to commissioner katayama your question about a review and analysis of time frames um we were in the middle of a pandemic. I just want to highlight that. I got caught with that one.,3878.96,3885.0
"(3885.0, 3893.0)"," So a lot of the time for review and processing was not only potentially stalled because of, you know, the pandemic.",3885.0,3893.0
"(3893.0, 3899.0)"," Staff had retired. Other agencies that have to do reviews, for example, Department of Health or SHPD,",3893.0,3899.0
"(3899.0, 3905.76)", also established new processes that we had to work through and navigate through so um while some of,3899.0,3905.76
"(3905.76, 3910.4)", the numbers may not line up i we do have data and statistics on permits process etc through,3905.76,3910.4
"(3910.4, 3919.44)", my four years uh i i think a lot of it was just situation based and timing okay appreciate that,3910.4,3919.44
"(3920.0, 3927.68)", mr katayama oh no thank you kaleo i mean i guess in going through this process our fiduciary or,3920.0,3927.68
"(3927.68, 3935.12)", i believe my fiduciary responsibility is to cover all the bases and you know,3927.68,3935.12
"(3935.12, 3937.92)", all the testimony and support i think was well deserved,3935.12,3937.92
"(3939.68, 3945.44)", mahalo and i appreciate the question and then um hopefully item c2 will also highlight some of the,3939.68,3945.44
"(3945.44, 3952.32)", the limits of of our resources and the budget and staff that we do have thank you thank you,3945.44,3952.32
"(3954.96, 3965.84)"," anything else mr katayama no i'm fine thank you chair thank you very much um mr meyer Mr. Meyer, would you like to share any words?",3954.96,3965.84
"(3966.54, 3967.32)", Thank you.,3966.54,3967.32
"(3969.34, 3970.22)"," Yeah, I do have a concern.",3969.34,3970.22
"(3989.54, 3996.08)"," And the concern really is that over many years, I've boss the director and of course the deputy director or direct deputies",3989.54,3996.08
"(3996.8, 4003.46)", um to be of one mind and be pulling in the same direction and that usually implies that folks,3996.8,4003.46
"(4003.46, 4006.66)", have worked together for some time and they've had adequate,4003.46,4006.66
"(4006.66, 4014.04)", time and effort devoted to conforming their goals and objectives for the organization and the,4006.66,4014.04
"(4014.04, 4027.2)", mission and this is a situation where it appears to me that we haven't had that time unfortunately and that's the nature of the beast perhaps uh but we,4014.04,4027.2
"(4027.2, 4033.8)", don't even know for example if the if the uh chair's position is final uh if if that's correct,4027.2,4033.8
"(4033.8, 4038.24)", and I'm concerned about that this is something that should be discussed in executive session,4033.8,4038.24
"(4038.24, 4049.9)", by the way but uh that's a concern because uh the chair and the deputy should be able to finish each other's sentences,4038.24,4049.9
"(4049.9, 4055.84)", they should have complete agreement they should really conform the concepts of goals and directions,4049.9,4055.84
"(4055.84, 4067.92)", and in a small organization a relatively small organization uh like the commission uh that is a big task and and shortfalls in budget and in,4055.84,4067.92
"(4067.92, 4074.64)", staffing that's something that's really critical it's critical to achieving the correct objectives,4067.92,4074.64
"(4074.64, 4081.24)", for the people of Hawaii to filling our obligations under the water code and I'm just concerned that,4074.64,4081.24
"(4081.24, 4087.76)", we haven't had the time to for that conformance and unity of goals and missions,4081.24,4087.76
"(4087.76, 4094.64)", and thoughts to take place um and uh i hope it doesn't appear that there are differences of,4087.76,4094.64
"(4094.64, 4102.96)", opinion or uh things uh don't get done as efficiently as is possible because that would,4094.64,4102.96
"(4102.96, 4106.08)", be unfortunate and again this is something that we,4102.96,4106.08
"(4106.08, 4110.24)", should have talked about in an executive session i really think that we need to make use of that,4106.08,4110.24
"(4110.88, 4118.24)", vehicle more often in situations like this that being said i admire kaleo i admire his work and,4110.88,4118.24
"(4118.24, 4126.9)"," he certainly got a lot of energy and i appreciate and admire that. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. Meyer.",4118.24,4126.9
"(4126.9, 4127.88)", Kathy Hull.,4126.9,4127.88
"(4129.64, 4130.7)", Did we lose you?,4129.64,4130.7
"(4130.7, 4131.78)"," Yeah, thank you.",4130.7,4131.78
"(4131.78, 4133.06)", Thank you.,4131.78,4133.06
"(4133.06, 4134.82)", I've only been sitting as a commissioner,4133.06,4134.82
"(4134.82, 4136.16)"," for about 18 months,",4134.82,4136.16
"(4136.16, 4139.28)"," and in that time that I've worked with Kaleo,",4136.16,4139.28
"(4139.28, 4144.28)", I must say he has a lot of energy and positive energy.,4139.28,4144.28
"(4144.66, 4156.3)"," He is committed to the mission of the commission, and that is to protect and sustain our resources and our precious water, which I am also committed to.",4144.66,4156.3
"(4158.18, 4160.12)", We have some disagreements.,4158.18,4160.12
"(4160.24, 4169.8)", We've talked about them. We have we will continue to work towards the betterment of our state.,4160.24,4169.8
"(4169.8, 4180.16)", And I I I'm pleased that he has been nominated and fully support his nomination.,4169.8,4180.16
"(4180.9, 4185.6)"," Thank you very much, Kathy. I appreciate the comments. I just have a few comments.",4180.9,4185.6
"(4186.96, 4193.44)"," And I appreciated both Mr. Katayama and Mr. Meyer's comments. You know, I will tell you,",4186.96,4193.44
"(4195.44, 4208.4)", this is a historic moment for us. One that the governor has had confidence in nominating me as the first native Hawaiian woman with a team Laura Ka'akua,4195.44,4208.4
"(4208.4, 4216.24)", as the first as a first deputy and Kalea Manuel as the deputy for the water commission I think it is,4208.4,4216.24
"(4216.24, 4228.8)", a statement about the governor's commitment and his recognition of sensitivity to the Hawaiian community and that we do bring that to a department,4216.24,4228.8
"(4229.52, 4235.6)", that is so cr that touches and concerns every single person whether you live here or whether,4229.52,4235.6
"(4235.6, 4248.0)", you visit but most particularly native Hawaiians and you will find that I am a process person. There are people that are far smarter than me on substance.,4235.6,4248.0
"(4248.0, 4267.12)"," But I am a process person who believes in providing a safe venue and platform for genuine community engagement. I have appreciated the good work of Kaleo, as articulated by many of you who have provided",4248.0,4267.12
"(4267.12, 4275.06)"," testimony that, you know, and sometimes I call it the pendulum swings a bit, and the",4267.12,4275.06
"(4275.06, 4283.58)", pendulum has swung a bit where we are creating a platform for voices that have historically,4275.06,4283.58
"(4283.58, 4286.2)", not been heard.,4283.58,4286.2
"(4293.28, 4295.0)"," And it is, but those people who have probably been the most affected by decisions of the Water Commission and other agencies.",4293.28,4295.0
"(4295.0, 4303.72)"," So both in DLNR and at the Water Commission, it is my intention to create a space for those",4295.0,4303.72
"(4303.72, 4310.0)", good conversations. I intend to use the Board of Land and Natural Resources as well as the Water Commission as a vehicle to hear community voices and concerns.,4303.72,4310.0
"(4310.0, 4326.0)"," We may not all have the same decision, but we're going to try very hard to create a place for those voices to be heard.",4310.0,4326.0
"(4327.0, 4329.2)", You know.,4327.0,4329.2
"(4330.84, 4334.64)", It is.,4330.84,4334.64
"(4336.04, 4336.84)", For me.,4336.04,4336.84
"(4339.68, 4340.88)", Our first duty is to the mission of the water code.,4339.68,4340.88
"(4342.96, 4343.76)"," We're not here to necessarily advocate,",4342.96,4343.76

"(4354.32, 4357.32)", What was it intended to do?,4354.32,4357.32
"(4357.32, 4366.06)"," With respect to sort of my style of management, I say I am much too makule, too old to micromanage.",4357.32,4366.06
"(4373.68, 4374.26)"," But it is to provide the team, the staff, with the tools for them to be successful,",4373.68,4374.26
"(4377.52, 4388.94)"," whether it's resources, capacity, or funding. But it's also to provide good input as we all make informed decisions we are going to do a lot of internal",4377.52,4388.94
"(4388.94, 4397.04)", coordinations to Mr Meyer Mr takayama's comments we're going to speak very candidly within these,4388.94,4397.04
"(4397.04, 4407.04)", walls all the divisions will speak and we have numerous divisions that don't necessarily have the same mission but when we leave dlanar,4397.04,4407.04
"(4407.04, 4413.12)", we better have one voice but that means that we're going to have a lot of hard discussions internally,4407.04,4413.12
"(4413.68, 4419.92)", and um and not everybody agrees with me and i don't agree with everybody but we're going to,4413.68,4419.92
"(4419.92, 4427.68)", create a an environment where people can feel like they have the ability to say what they have to say.,4419.92,4427.68
"(4429.28, 4436.88)"," And you're right, I am not confirmed. I am, so I am here, I am the interim appointee,",4429.28,4436.88
"(4436.88, 4472.4)"," subject to Senate confirmation. And I don't know how that's all going to go, but during the time that I've got here and and i think visions for the implementation of",4436.88,4472.4

"(4489.6, 4496.24)", we will be able to continue the good work that's already been instituted by the previous,4489.6,4496.24

"(4502.08, 4506.72)", but i would do the best that i can i am extremely grateful that kaleo,4502.08,4506.72
"(4507.28, 4513.92)", has come back to return that is the governor's decision to reappoint kaleo,4507.28,4513.92
"(4514.8, 4528.96)", but i think he has also heard a lot of the people in the community so with that being said mahalo um i'm going to call for the question a motion has been made,4514.8,4528.96

"(6036.36, 6046.6)", why isn't DOH a party to the EPA and Navy's administrative order on consent. And that really is because the Department of Health,6036.36,6046.6

"(10602.98, 10625.64)"," my last tenure prior to that we've been short I mean we've grown since 1987 it's been around this this much we've between the teens deal on our budget. So we talk about balance and need for resources,",10602.98,10625.64
"(10625.64, 10629.84)"," 27 out of 1,084 for water is really telling.",10625.64,10629.84
"(10629.84, 10632.84)", And that's the picture that I try to paint for most people.,10629.84,10632.84
"(10632.84, 10634.62)", 22 of those are general funded.,10632.84,10634.62
"(10634.62, 10636.14)"," Five of the other are,",10634.62,10636.14
"(10636.14, 10637.82)", five of them are special funded,10636.14,10637.82
"(10637.82, 10641.66)", out of the state land development fund.,10637.82,10641.66
"(10641.66, 10644.34)", Those are revenues generated off of leases developed,10641.66,10644.34
"(10644.34, 10645.44)", by land division,10644.34,10645.44
"(10645.44, 10653.36)", on before the board our fiscal 23 operating budget was a little over 4 million that includes,10645.44,10653.36
"(10654.16, 10667.84)"," almost 3 million in general funds and then special funds those are our ceilings so we have a ceiling of $356,474 from our Water Resource Management Special Fund, and",10654.16,10667.84
"(10667.84, 10675.86)"," then a ceiling of $812,768 from what we call our SPAM Special Fund.",10667.84,10675.86
"(10675.86, 10684.88)"," The SPAM Special Fund funds those five positions, but also has about $110,000 that comes from",10675.86,10684.88
"(10684.88, 10689.52)", the SLDF fund for stream studies it primarily,10684.88,10689.52
"(10689.52, 10696.56)", pays for staff travel the team that you see here doing our stream measuring monitoring etc um as,10689.52,10696.56
"(10696.56, 10709.42)"," well as pays for some of our stream cages um the other general funds that are used, almost almost 2 million goes to staff personnel costs.",10696.56,10709.42
"(10709.42, 10714.2)", Right now about a million goes to the USGS gauging contract.,10709.42,10714.2
"(10714.2, 10719.8)"," So we have almost very limited, maybe less than half a million of discretionary funding",10714.2,10719.8
"(10719.8, 10721.74)", for our general operations.,10719.8,10721.74
"(10721.74, 10724.98)", So that's just the world that we have to work within.,10721.74,10724.98
"(10724.98, 10725.6)", And so we talk about,10724.98,10725.6
"(10725.6, 10730.32)", resources and managing resources so those are some of the challenges we work on yeah go ahead,10725.6,10730.32
"(10730.32, 10737.36)", do you have all the position funded positions filled great question so no the four positions,10730.32,10737.36
"(10737.36, 10748.08)", so we got four aquatic biologists positions in spam branch that make up these 27 um those four uh were created in 2019 taken away during,10737.36,10748.08
"(10748.08, 10755.52)", pandemic and just got put back in last session so we're working on establishing those um we have one,10748.08,10755.52
"(10755.52, 10761.28)", vacancy in groundwater that we're trying to fill and then come february 1st that'll be it we'll,10755.52,10761.28
"(10761.28, 10765.84)", just have that those four aquatic biologists positions and that one um,10761.28,10765.84
"(10765.84, 10774.42)", groundwater position that's vacant so 22 we'll have 22 filled yeah oh second quick did i miss,10765.84,10774.42
"(10774.42, 10781.22)", it where do fines go fines will go into the water resource management fund second yeah so that those,10774.42,10781.22
"(10781.22, 10790.06)", fines fees those come in and that's the special management fund under 174C5.5 that articulates what that fund can be used for.,10781.22,10790.06
"(10791.36, 10799.98)"," And in general, we've advocated for, I've advocated since I've been here, for $2 million annually in the CIP budget for deep monitoring well development.",10791.36,10799.98
"(10799.98, 10802.86)", It costs about that much to do one deep monitoring well.,10799.98,10802.86
"(10803.78, 10807.68)"," And so far, we've been successful in upping that to yearly requests.",10803.78,10807.68
"(10808.22, 10813.16)"," Prior administrations or strategies have been to ask every supplemental year, so every other year.",10808.22,10813.16
"(10814.48, 10824.14)"," But in our USGS monitoring program or proposed build out, it's going to take, you know, 100 years if we just do one every two years.",10814.48,10824.14
"(10824.14, 10826.64)", So we need to really ramp this up and,10824.14,10826.64
"(10826.64, 10831.04)", and ask for more development funds if we want to get a better understanding especially of our,10826.64,10831.04
"(10831.04, 10837.52)", groundwater resources and aquifers in the face of climate change so that's the base um next slide,10831.04,10837.52
"(10837.52, 10843.92)", i'm going to talk about what got into the budget is in the budget now so we had asked for those,10837.52,10843.92
"(10843.92, 10846.88)", four aquatic biologists positions were re-established,10843.92,10846.88
"(10846.88, 10851.84)", but whenever you re-establish start positions you only get half the year funding so this year we're,10846.88,10851.84
"(10851.84, 10856.88)", asking for full year funding which is identified there for those four aquatic biologists positions,10851.84,10856.88
"(10856.88, 10862.32)", we are working with our hr office to determine whether that classification is appropriate or not,10856.88,10862.32
"(10862.32, 10865.48)", and we may be shifting to some other classifications,10862.32,10865.48
"(10865.48, 10868.24)", like general professionals that gives us more flexibility,10865.48,10868.24
"(10868.24, 10870.7)", to meet the needs of our staff,10868.24,10870.7
"(10870.7, 10872.94)", and the work that we need to do.,10870.7,10872.94
"(10872.94, 10876.72)", Then there's a CIP appropriation for deep monitoring wealth.,10872.94,10876.72
"(10876.72, 10881.72)"," So those are the two funding, the budget that was approved",10876.72,10881.72
"(10881.92, 10884.22)", that made it into the EA administration budget.,10881.92,10884.22
"(10887.44, 10892.16)"," And then legislation, Senate Bill 1386 was just introduced yesterday, but that was an admin bill that we put in.",10887.44,10892.16
"(10892.88, 10899.92)", This is relating to declaring water shortage an emergency. So further dealing with this Red Hill,10892.88,10899.92
"(10899.92, 10908.46)"," disaster and issue, one of the things working with Attorney Generals is that the ability to declare an emergency was tied to",10899.92,10908.46
"(10908.46, 10911.88)", the shortage and shortage planning as articulated in code.,10908.46,10911.88
"(10912.04, 10914.74)", And so we wanted to do and what we're recommending is to split,10912.04,10914.74
"(10914.74, 10917.94)"," it out to say that if there's under you know, there is",10914.74,10917.94
"(10918.12, 10920.5)"," emergency, the Commission has that explicit authority to",10918.12,10920.5
"(10920.5, 10924.94)", declare an emergency. And so we there's language and amendments,10920.5,10924.94
"(10924.94, 10925.44)", to the code to give the Commission that authority to declare an emergency. And so we there's language and amendments to the code,10924.94,10925.44
"(10926.24, 10930.88)"," to give the Commission that authority to deal with situations like this, hoping we don't ever",10926.24,10930.88
"(10930.88, 10936.48)", have to use it. But and that we can anticipate shortage with better data and planning and,10930.88,10936.48
"(10936.48, 10942.0)"," proactive kind of research. But if we did need to use that, we'd have that tool available to us.",10936.48,10942.0
"(10942.64, 10945.68)", That was in response to this Red Hill situation. Next slide.,10942.64,10945.68
"(10948.88, 10954.16)", This is just a graphic of DLNR's overall CIP budget. I wanted to bring this up.,10948.88,10954.16
"(10954.16, 10959.44)", So the greenish color is the two million in CIP for the monitoring well development.,10954.16,10959.44
"(10961.04, 10976.0)"," Last year we got a lump fund appropriation from the legislature, and as part of the cool down of the chair is to prioritize all of the CIP projects throughout the agency so fortunately, water commission has been able to stay on top of that table and get part of that",10961.04,10976.0
"(10976.0, 10985.44)", lump sum of the portion of the 220 million so I just wanted to show graphically some of the things that we are also being balanced against with the overall agency.,10976.0,10985.44
"(10987.12, 10994.56)"," Next slide. And then lastly, the green administration had asked us for potential",10987.12,10994.56
"(10994.56, 11000.88)"," budget modifications or requested budget items. These actually, we added some, but some of these",10994.56,11000.88
"(11000.88, 11010.88)", were part of our original EGAY administration ask apps but weren't actually in the governor's budget so what we did put it forward is we submitted a request to add seven new positions,11000.88,11010.88
"(11010.88, 11016.0)", to groundwater and survey branch and that's really to kind of ramp up and meet the needs of some of,11010.88,11016.0
"(11016.72, 11023.12)", our groundwater water work and our water use permit approvals and reviews dealing with red,11016.72,11023.12
"(11023.12, 11025.76)", hill issues etc et cetera.,11023.12,11025.76
"(11025.76, 11029.94)"," I framed this under climate crisis research and monitoring, but it's really important",11025.76,11029.94
"(11029.94, 11033.04)", that we start to put money towards this.,11029.94,11033.04
"(11033.04, 11039.88)", And so we've asked for additional funding to add more streamgages to our system.,11033.04,11039.88
"(11039.88, 11043.58)", USGS can only handle about five gauges a year.,11039.88,11043.58
"(11043.58, 11045.56)", So we're asking for five every year.,11043.58,11045.56
"(11045.56, 11047.32)", And the idea is just to keep asking,11045.56,11047.32
"(11047.32, 11049.08)", for that every single year.,11047.32,11049.08
"(11049.08, 11050.8)", It's still not gonna get us to build up,11049.08,11050.8
"(11050.8, 11052.78)"," for another couple of decades,",11050.8,11052.78
"(11054.04, 11056.82)", but we're hoping that we can beef that up,11054.04,11056.82
"(11056.82, 11057.92)", and partner with USGS,11056.82,11057.92
"(11057.92, 11060.0)", and working with our congressional delegation,11057.92,11060.0
"(11060.0, 11063.88)", to increase the federal resources in that program as well.,11060.0,11063.88

"(11073.72, 11076.06)", to build off of the year of LIMU,11073.72,11076.06
"(11076.06, 11078.74)"," and actually look at how groundwater,",11076.06,11078.74
"(11078.74, 11080.8)", especially groundwater-dependent ecosystems,11078.74,11080.8
"(11080.8, 11086.72)"," and the research that they've done in Keohokalho on Mimū, if we can start to partner with",11080.8,11086.72
"(11086.72, 11091.64)", them because that is the next kind of thing that we have to really understand is how groundwater,11086.72,11091.64
"(11091.64, 11097.46)", affects near shore ecosystems and our near shore environments as another public trust use of water.,11091.64,11097.46
"(11097.46, 11103.52)", And then to support our work with Water Resource Research Center funding to help with the,11097.46,11103.52
"(11103.52, 11107.24)", management of the Hawaii MESA net program through the,11103.52,11107.24
"(11107.24, 11109.5)", Hawaii climate data portal.,11107.24,11109.5
"(11109.5, 11114.02)", Then one push that's here that I think we need to take that off because it didn't get,11109.5,11114.02
"(11114.02, 11118.74)"," in, but we've been talking about in order to shorten that timeframe of 100 years if",11114.02,11118.74
"(11118.74, 11126.96)"," we develop a demodering well every year, every other year, we have to just do more and um we're wanting to increase that to",11118.74,11126.96
"(11126.96, 11131.92)", five to ten to five ten million but we're also looking at federal funding resources to hopefully,11126.96,11131.92
"(11131.92, 11138.4)", supplement our double down on our state budget that we do get allocated here so that's generally,11131.92,11138.4
"(11138.4, 11147.2)", our budget um the the omit the increase of five million a year that didn't make it into the cip um sorry that was a,11138.4,11147.2
"(11147.2, 11152.64)", typo that didn't get there get changed out before we ended but that's it i think those that's the,11147.2,11152.64
"(11152.64, 11168.56)", last slide um any questions from commissioners or eds on budget and like lean yeah very lean very where we are trying to be optimistic with,11152.64,11168.56
"(11168.56, 11175.92)", governor green's commitment to climate change to utilize you know that we need to be prepared from,11168.56,11175.92
"(11175.92, 11182.48)", the water commission side to you know address some of commissioner katayama's question about,11175.92,11182.48
"(11182.48, 11186.0)", being more proactive what can we do in light of climate change?,11182.48,11186.0
"(11186.0, 11195.0)", And I think we need to be situated to take advantage of both federal funds as well as the governor's commitment to climate change.,11186.0,11195.0
"(11195.0, 11207.84)"," So, but I do want to use our public, our Water Commission meeting also as a public forum as appropriate legislation arises to bring that",11195.0,11207.84
"(11207.84, 11214.32)", to the commission's attention as well as the public's attention so that we create a forum,11207.84,11214.32
"(11214.32, 11230.12)", for public to provide us testimony or comments on proposed legislation so any comments from the commissioners before we look at our final schedule and adjourn?,11214.32,11230.12

"(11233.36, 11234.08)"," Yes, we can.",11233.36,11234.08
"(11234.2, 11234.42)", Okay.,11234.2,11234.42
"(11235.14, 11236.16)", Just a quick one.,11235.14,11236.16
"(11236.24, 11248.88)"," I know this is constrained with the practicality of the budget, but two questions one um where in your positions is there a point person or people to interface",11236.24,11248.88
"(11248.88, 11255.54)", with doh as we have joint responsibilities is there that position and two you know,11248.88,11255.54
"(11256.26, 11269.32)"," um are there positions that do not yet exist in divisions that may not exist that would be ideal to have just so we keep in mind the ideal capacity of seaworm versus the current, you know.",11256.26,11269.32
"(11269.92, 11285.92)"," Yeah, no, that's a great question. We haven't, I will say, we haven't dreamt yet about what the ideal seaworm function and real full buildout would look like because it's you're really quickly reminded in government like",11269.92,11285.92
"(11285.92, 11291.68)", you that's too big and too much and so I hear what you're saying and one of the things you know at,11285.92,11291.68
"(11291.68, 11297.2)", least in these next four years I'm committed to is helping to support staff to build their capacity,11291.68,11297.2
"(11297.2, 11305.68)", and get more bodies in and part of that is growing smartly in a smart way when you throw massive lumps of money and,11297.2,11305.68
"(11305.68, 11313.28)", resources the training the onboarding that really changing culture is is a shock and so what we're,11305.68,11313.28
"(11313.28, 11318.72)", proposing or what i've been proposing with staff is these realistic requests for staffing and,11313.28,11318.72
"(11318.72, 11325.0)", budget so we can grow smart um and help to build that capacity over time.,11318.72,11325.0

"(11357.6, 11367.76)", next round or you know thanks for confirming me um is to really tighten up our doh and seaworm staff collaboration our processing and,11357.6,11367.76
"(11368.48, 11373.84)", to really understand when who's on first and in certain situations and tighten up that relationship,11368.48,11373.84
"(11373.84, 11378.4)", and even looking at funding opportunities right they have the revolving loan funds or revolving,11373.84,11378.4

"(11388.6, 11394.92)"," So it's a long winded answer, but I think there's definitely enough momentum to better",11388.6,11394.92

"(11399.88, 11400.88)", Right.,11399.88,11400.88
"(11400.88, 11403.06)", Kathy and I are continuing on from last administration.,11400.88,11403.06
"(11403.06, 11410.8)", So I think we can hit the ground running other unlike other departments that really have to kind of build that up that momentum up so,11403.06,11410.8
"(11410.8, 11416.96)", I'm hopeful not putting Kathy on the spot but I think we can do good things together and keep up,11410.8,11416.96
"(11416.96, 11427.52)", the momentum that we've created since last time no I appreciate the question too aurora i think there is this administration as well as our own internal,11416.96,11427.52
"(11427.52, 11434.96)", is really committed to better internal coordination that we have to we have to be in sync,11427.52,11434.96
"(11434.96, 11442.48)", there's really no reason because it all goes back to the public's trust when we aren't in sync it,11434.96,11442.48
"(11442.48, 11466.88)"," leads to public mistrust so i think this administration has really emphasized the need for greater coordination internally, both within your own agency and then externally with your sister agencies before we go out to the public. that also with respect to dll you know we have been living quite frankly over the last decade",11442.48,11466.88
"(11467.68, 11473.12)", you know hand to mouth but there is going to be a great infusion of both federal funds,11467.68,11473.12
"(11473.68, 11478.72)", and this administration as well as the legislature's commitment in particular through,11473.68,11478.72

"(11557.0, 11566.32)", Then we'll be able to figure out and determine what are the resources we need to accomplish those overarching long-term plan goals um and that,11557.0,11566.32
"(11566.32, 11571.68)", framework is looking at things like climate change it is looking at things like place-based management,11566.32,11571.68
"(11571.68, 11578.8)", and elevating tradition ecological knowledge and and practice of native wines um that holistic,11571.68,11578.8
"(11578.8, 11592.0)"," world view on water resource management so i think once that framework is solid and this body as a whole adopts it, then we can start to build out that team to accomplish those larger goals and visions.",11578.8,11592.0
