Water Supply water demand.

Just kind of quickly to note in regards to the water uses, the majority, as you can see here, is for residential uses, with a smaller amount going towards commercial uses. And in terms of specific water users of Board of Water Supply water, the largest user is the Hawaiâ€˜i Kai Golf Course.

So next, moving into future water demand, to project future water demand, we came up with a range of different scenarios, three different scenarios to project water demand in the year 2040, the low, mid, and high, and then two different water demand scenarios for the year 2100. We don't necessarily have the time here to get into all the specific details of these water demand scenarios, but the low demand scenario does represent the most probable as it follows the city's population projections as well as the anticipated water conservation efforts; whereas, the mid demand and high demand scenarios include potential other futures considering if population were to increase or water conservation were to be decreased in certain ways.

Additionally, the ultimate demand scenarios include factors such as the impacts of sea level -- of 3.2 feet of sea level rise as well as the differences in rainfall projections with two different sub scenarios being based on the wet rainfall projection as well as the dry.
