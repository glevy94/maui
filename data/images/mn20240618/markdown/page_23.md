C. NON-ACTION ITEM / INFORMATIONAL BRIEFING

1. General Informational Briefing on Water Reservations for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands by Commission Staff

   **PRESENTATION GIVEN BY:** Katie Roth, Planning Branch Chief; Dr. Ayron Strauch, Acting Stream Protection and Management Branch Chief

   Staff presented the process of reserving water, existing and pending Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) water reservations, and future DHHL water demands.

   **QUESTIONS / COMMENTS**

   **COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** Can I interrupt you for a second? That last point- may have to adjust the IIFS (interim instream flow standard)- stream water is a resource and that's a public trust purpose, so are you saying from your standpoint that DHHL has superior rights than the stream itself?

   **KATIE ROTH:** Maybe I'll defer that to Ayron if he wants to comment a little bit more about his process when establishing.

   **COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** You can answer that later, I just wanted to interrupt you.

   **KATIE ROTH:** Okay, do you want to answer it now or later?

   **COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** When we get into the discussion.

   **KATIE ROTH:** Okay.

   **COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** Can they answer my question?

   **DR. STRAUCH:** Aloha Commissioners, Ayron Strauch of the Stream Protection and Management Branch. The modification of an IIFS in the balancing of non-instream uses might be needed to accommodate a reservation or use for DHHL as a public trust use. One example would be the 2018 decision and order in Nā Wai ‘Ehā that sets an IIFS on North Wai‘ehus as natural flow. At the time, DHHL was not a party to the Nā Wai ‘Ehā contested case and their potential non-instream usage was not considered in the decision,
