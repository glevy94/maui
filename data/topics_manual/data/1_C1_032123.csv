Find that Patrick and Naomi Guth (Guth Farms), Applicant, Violated Section 174C-93, HRS and Section 13-168-32, HAR Construction of a Stream Diversion Works Without a Permit; Find that No Fine be Imposed on the Applicant; and Approve the After-The-Fact Stream Diversion Works Permit Application (SDWP.5508.6), Kahoma Stream, Lahaina, Maui, Tax Map Key (2) 4-5-016:888 and 4-5-017:888 (Stream) and 4-5-016:009, 4-5- 017:005 and 007 (End Use)
Mr. Dean Uyeno, SPAM Program Manager, CWRM Mr. Uyeno apologized for the delay in the submittal of the permit application for after-the-fact stream diversion works. He provided an addendum to correct some information and requested to replace the original application with a revised one. The landowners for the diversion intakes are unknown, and the applicant will need to follow all current rules and regulations with the new landowners if identified in the future. The State historic preservation division has no objections to the ongoing use, although recommends the property owner hiring an archaeological consultant to develop a plan for the continued preservation for the Haia terrace system. The commission found that the applicant violated certain regulations but recommended no fines be imposed. The applicant worked with commission staff to comply with the current permit process. The approved stream diversion works permit is for 9000 gallons per day for two acres of dry land kalo and one acre of diversified agriculture from the Kahoma stream subject to standard and special conditions.
If the commission approves this, are we allowing commercial use for traditional and cultural native Hawaiian practices?
The applicants will be able to speak better to this portion. Their agriculture, which does provide for home use in a sense of bartering in a traditional customary way and some are being used for commercial sale. So, there is a twofold use.
I do understand the rationale because we are trying to streamline the permits, traditional and cultural. We know the issue of commercial use is out there and currently it’s not allowed. I believe if we approve this, we state somewhere in the recommendation that this is an ongoing issue, and we don’t want to set a precedence that then will be used by other people.
I think you bring up a good point. What we have been trying to do at the staff level is to work with the applicants. In this case, a majority of the use is for subsistence purposes and traditional customary practices. It’s a policy and balance that the commission must consider. But your right, traditional andcustomary practices do not include commercial use.
Maybe we need a statement saying this does not provide a precedence for any commercial use in any future applications.
One of the things we always advise is that you have the series of facts before you and this is specific to this permit application. We did highlight it in the submittal that staff, based on prior direction from the commission look at ways to help support traditional customary practices of native points in the permitting process. Whether an expedited or an exempted process is something we should pursue. I think this is related to the Alima Huli violation, which was very similar where a pump was put into the stream but supported traditional kalo cultivation. We are trying to balance with staff. Is one dollar worth of commercial the trigger or is it absolutely zero? Is it a range? We are using our best judgement in this context to provide a recommendation for you to consider, but this is a decision of the commission. 
I think the minutes should show the discussion that we are having in which should protect us in the future. Because what is the level of commercial use? I’m not against Farmer’s markets and landowners selling things for some sort of income.
Great question commissioner Buck and great response Kaleo. Are you in consultation with Kahuliao and the Native Hawaiian scholarship team at the Richardson school of law? They may have some thoughts on these rights and how they evolve in the current state.
We’ve been in contact and coordination with Kahuliao and others including our legislators, who have policy conversations about it. Last session, there were amendments to the Water Code that started to articulate. For example, licenses on kalo growing in a traditional customary manner. There was a conversation about whether commercial kalo farming would also qualify for that exemption from water licensing. There's also another indication on a policy level that this dialogue between what policy stance the state should take. I use kalo as an example, of a traditional customary practice. We are working with anybody to look at the evolution of the code on its application to our modern times. Some of the things we are looking at is an evaluation of the intent. In some of the reviews, on the commission reports it already starts to anticipate one of the recommendations which was to exempt all traditional customary practices from having to get a permit from us. They are still required to get a permit from us so we’re trying to balance between what is and isn’t required.
There has been legislation proposed this session regarding traditional customary practices and commercial use. It has been the position of the Department in our testimony that under article 12 section 7 it specifically says not for commercial use. We have taken the position that it is just for subsistence purposes. We understand it is an evolving issue. We are taking the position that traditional customary practices do not include commercial use and we were successful in getting proposed legislation to delete that. That’s a question probably far beyond at this point and time. Unless we change the law, we may be drawing a thin line but I think one that we’re holding to that it has to be traditional customary practices for subsistence use. Priority purposes of issuance and public trust, traditional customary practices may have a priority clearly over commercial use. But currently that is the Department’s position.
it’s a complicated issue but subsistence back in the day meant you traded kalo for fish. Today, you got to pay property taxes you got to pay for cultural consultant to subsist. It’s a difficult issue and I appreciate that the consideration is being made. I have a question for Ohana Guth, do you perceive that the retention of an archaeological consultant can get expensive and is that going to pose a burden on your ohana of users?
absolutely. We got a quote from SMS, and they want to charge us $11,500 plus airplane fare and car rental and last year we made $25,000. You guys are talking commercial but we are providing food for our kupunas. We do 2 farmers markets a month, that’s it, that’s all we can handle. We are in our 60’s and we farmed almost 40 years of our life. Saying that we have water going through the Haia terraces down to our property all of that is untrue.
Did any of this Haia terrace extend to Kamehameha schools land? Is it in that vicinity or is it off their land? Could it be that Kamehameha, who has land in that area, may have done some landscape level archaeological reviews? They may be able to provide you with access to that information. I would encourage outreach to the school who’s done a lot of research on their land and the surroundings.
I’d like to share a little bit about my background. I am a lineal descendant. My maiden name is Akiona. My father was Albert Kauhilani Akiona, his mother was Mabel Mahoe Akeo Akiona, and her mother is Ella Papiweloa Haia Kekai. Her father is Haia Kekai. So that Haia terraces are family to me. I would never desecrate any of the burials or the land. All we are doing is farming.
Kaleo, perhaps our staff could help facilitate the access of the information. So that it’s acquired through somebody that you have to retain at their expense, which would be a burden to them. We might be able to get that information in other ways. We might be able to provide the assurance to SHPD that the sites are being adequately protected from use and not a threat to the sanctity of the sites.
Can I also give you a little history of our history with SHPD? When we first purchased the property in 2020. We began the application process with Rebecca Alakai. Item 34 on the application was to reach out to SHPD and we did. Again, this was in 2020 when covid was full blown. I talked to Andrew McAllister, and he told me they weren’t doing site visits because of covid so, we marked that on our application. We navigated our way through the application, which was difficult. But Rebecca helped us and in November we finally had it all to the place where they deemed it complete. We submitted it and the following year in 2021 we were actually on the agenda a few times but got taken off because they decided they needed to look a little deeper into our application. They suddenly became aware of our association with the Haia terraces. I let them know that we are very familiar with it because it’s my wife’s ohana. In fact, she has family buried up there as recent as her father’s siblings that died at birth. There were 11 children but two of them had died and were buried in Keoihuihu which is the area. They let us know that they had a new website and that we had to navigate that now, so we did. In November of 2021, we finally got that completed and in January they said that they completed the review and that we needed a letter from the government agency who requested the review. We let CWRM know and at that time we were told that they were super busy, and they would get to it, so we left it at that. That was in January 2021 and then in May of 2021 we received a letter from Kathy Yoda with a new form that the State Historic Preservation was putting out there for people to use. He asked that we use that. I explained that we already went through the review, and they said they never got a determination letter. I asked well did you ever send that letter in that they asked for? They said they forgot. So, they sent it to me. I had to upload it and send it to SHPD. I sent in that new form and what it did was it generated a whole new review. So, this was in June that I got this new review submitted. We waited and waited and kept calling because it was holding up our application. Then SHPD finally, in last November, tells us that they cannot do a review of our property because it’s an after the fact and according to their books we’ve already unearthed the area and they show it in their pictures that we have a stream diversion on that side of the stream and water flowing through the Haia terraces, that is totally false. We have six land commission awards, two on one side of the stream and four on the other. The two on one side of the stream are accessible for us to drive, to do our work during covid. It was perfect because we had six grown kids and their families, and everybody came and helped us clear the land and plant kalo. It was a special time for us. We didn’t do anything across the stream, which is where four more land commission awards are. The Haia terrace property is adjacent to ours on top of the hill. We are down at the stream area and they are on top of the hill. This is the land where Kahoma stream and Kanaha stream merge. It goes up about 200 feet and that’s where the Haia property terrace is. For them to say that we have a diversion in which we don’t, and that we have water going through the terraces, is so unbelievable. There’s nothing we can do about it because they never came out to visit. We wanted them to do a site visit, but they never did. In fact, I could barely get a hold of them since they sent the determination letter saying they’re going to recommend to CWRM that we get denied. I wrote to Dean that I’m just flustered. I don’t know what to do. I appreciate Dean and his willingness to try. He came out there with Alexa and Ayron and they could see that we hadn’t done anything over there. It’s still in its natural state. There’s no reason why SHPD cannot come out and do a study to see if the terraces are being impacted or will be impacted by any type of cultivation or planting. There’s nothing we have done there except build a bridge that goes from one bank to the other, that’s all. Now they want us to call a consultant. We called several and finally one answered. The expenses for the consultant, the car and airfare is $12,000. All we want to do is grow food. I have a degree in Agriculture from the University of Manoa and ever since we’ve been married in 1984, we’ve always done some sort of subsistent farming out in Honokohau and now we are continuing to do this up here. We make kulolo and sell it at the farmer’s market. We were making poi for a while, but the Board of Health said we can’t because we don’t have a commercial kitchen unless we pound the poi by hand. I tried but it’s too hard. We should not have to go to the private sector and empty our bank account.
It seems like SHPD’s position may be based on misinformation and the lack of ground truthing site visit, rather than kind of take an easy path for a state agency to have the applicant prove something at their expense. Is there a way we can get this clarified? And avoid that expense which would be a burden.
Commissioner Hannahs, you know what I’m going to recommend. Do you know Hinano Rodrigues? He’s our Cultural and History branch chief on Maui. I would ask that Hinano talk story and review SHPD’s letter with you and any changes that needs to be made. Hinano will have the opportunity to review this. Clearly you have a lineal connection to this land. I cannot imagine that you would in any way attempt to damage or desecrate your ohana that’s there. When we get down to the recommendations, that will be something that I will recommend, especially if he’s there on Maui. I think he would be in a better position to make an appropriate recommendation to SHPD regarding your particular activity. Commissioners, do you have any questions before I have the Guth’s have an opportunity to tell us? There’s any additional information? 
Ayron Strauch from the Stream Protection Management Branch. Dr. Strauch explained that staff with the Stream Protection Management Branch conducted multiple site visits and provided photographs for context.
Let me just be clear. The terrace system, from what I understand is an agricultural system. There’s also been an intermixing of burials language in the conversation. After talking with SHPD and the Guth’s the burials are located up mauka. So, the burials aren’t going to be impacted but under Historic Preservation law we have an obligation to protect archaeological sites especially, if they are registered. I think that is the extent of the comment that came from archaeological branch. So, I think your recommendation to have the culture and historic branch review this and provide additional recommendations to this body would be helpful. Even with lineal descendants that have claims. These are just larger wahi kupuna stewardship issues that we have to deal with wai throughout the state. There is a nexus here with the re-establishment of wai and traditional cultural sites before the water commission.
sometimes we just have to use common sense and be practical. But Hinano is from the area, and we should give him an opportunity to visit the Guth’s if he hasn’t already and provide us with an assessment based upon a site visit based upon his own cultural and historical knowledge of the area. Doing a site visit will give him a better appreciation for what you are doing in relationship to these particular sites. He knows that your activities is going to be further makai from where the historic sites are, out of harm's way of both the burials as well as the features. So, let's see what he says. I think Hinano takes into consideration people's lineal connection. I mean not in any way disregarding SHPD and the archaeologists, but I think this is one that merits cultural considerations. So, as we get to the recommendations let's explore. Ayron It’s 11:20, The Guth’s would you like to provide any overview of what you’re doing before we take a break? I know there are people here who’ve either provided written comments or would like to provide oral comments.
I think that I’ve said all that I needed to at this time.
We enjoy what we do every day. People drive by and see us out there working hard. We love it we always have, and we hope that our kids and grandkids that come up there, enjoy it and carry this on as well. We try to grow as many things that we can eat and don’t like to grow anything that we don’t like to eat. But we do enjoy eating what we grow. Our papayas, bananas, our kalo. And We’ve planted a lot of mango trees and this year they’re starting to flower for the first time and give fruit. We have a whole backyard down in Lahaina of plants and are excited to put in the ground fruit trees. That will help us to live off the land and for our family and grandchildren. So that’s our dream. We have our legacy lands that we will pass down to our children and hope our children will continue this legacy of farming the land and working the land. 
I'd like to say that these lands that we have are legacy lands that we will pass it down to our children. I hope our children will continue this legacy of farming the land, working the land, that is what we've always done and something that we really enjoy. We believe that we can only be stewards of the land and we need to take care of the land.
We don’t use any fertilizers. We don't use any pesticides. We do everything by hand and that's what's going on with the Guth Ohana
Can I just ask, are you connected to this land? Is this where you grew up? Where your ohana grew up?
No, this is not my family land. We bought this from West Maui Land. 
Mahalo to this commission once again for allowing me to provide my testimony. A lot of key things that came up in the discussion. Mahalo to Commissioner Buck for that question on Commercial uses. Which is not only missed and out of context many times. Everybody looked at just the basic concept of what that means. When you start talking about what kind of rights kuleana basically have versus people who purchase property. It’s different in my eyes. Mahalo to Kaleo for your mana’o and to you, Chair Chang for your knowledge and clarification of article 12 section 7. The Hawaii revised statute 7-1 on gathering rights. Subsistence gathering rights is not for commercial use. This HRS is from the Privy Council of 1850 and used as a system to clarify its uses. Based on what I heard then and how it kind of intermingled to today's policies. I'd like to mention that I am a recognized lineal descendant of Keoihuihu burial terrace known as the Haia Terraces which Kaleo corrected. The burials are lower, my mana‘o provided by Uncle Jonah Keahi is no longer with us. But a descendancy recognition came from State Historic Preservations site number 50 50-03-01776 and what I'm saying is that any further discussion that has to do with the State Historic Preservation division, to consider the recognize the lineal descendants as well, to be a part of the consultation. Not only myself, but also, there's two others that were recognized to the State Historic Preservation Branch and the Burial Council which is Namea‘aia Alpachino and Kahikilani Niles. Which is one that would recognize the lineal descendants. If any work or anything that even encroaches upon those areas should have some kind of consultation with recognize lineal descendants. There's a report that we have on the ongoing work for the Corps of Engineer back in 1974. In the last stage of the report it basically stresses the importance of their concluded recommendations. That any other work that is done within this area, which is not related to the Kahoma Stream Flood Project. When they were doing it back then, they had to take into serious consideration federal archaeological work needs to be justified. If necessary, to the Kahoma stream terraced area that was implemented in this archaeological plan that was done in 1974. There's another issue that I would like to also put on the table. There are multiple land commission awards in my records. I had three of them and the one that I have kuleana to is the land commission award of 8021 ʻāpana 1 royal patent 1732. There's another one by Nalehu which is another parcel. The information or 6621 Royal Patent 1722 issue to Nalehu. The Haia terrace is also mentioned in the osteological report that these areas are highly significant and also kuleana live in that area today. The Haia Terrace, where we are right now is in the process of putting together a lot of these applications for water to address these area. After the designation was made it was important for us to make sure that we are implemented in a plan. How we will be able to continue our kalo cultivation within the areas that I mentioned. The land commission award and the possibility of getting simple water up Haia terrace so we can start managing and beautifying the terrace area. Cutting the grass down so it’s eminent that we’re looking at what we actually protecting that’s a long management plan. I’m hoping to take into consideration that these things need to involve the recognized lineal descendants of the area. I also want to ask that tax map key 245-017:002 should be stricken to this request. This kuleana that we live on and if this plan goes forward what does it do for our application? There are other pending applications that are in this area that is in the process now for the water use permit. How is this going to impact or negatively affect the work that we’ve been doing? Because we call our designation those lands that have been cultivated. Even above in Kahoma with the repatriation of waters provided by Kamehameha schools we put water in the river to make sure that the kuleana had water or the ongoing cultivation of the taro. So the main request is to make sure that 245017.002 is stricken from this request because we live there and there was no permission by doing all these altercations going fast forward. Mahalo, for this opportunity I am here to answer any of your questions.
Keaaumoku, are you familiar with the Guth’s?
I see them. I like the work that they're doing in the valley. I have no problem with that they're just certain clarification that I want to make sure that we're a part of. Especially when it comes to the consultation of the Haia terrace.
Do the lineal descendants meet regularly?
We meet every Monday. We sit down and talk about the water use permit application. Because once the designation was made, I want to stress again that it's important for us to make sure that we lay down the ground rules, pertaining to what we can do and what we cannot do to provide clarity. This is not just Kahoma it's Kalaula going into the water use throughout Komohana. Komohana kuleana was the one that was vital to the state designation that we really thought we needed. Because we were being left out of the picture, so we supported the designation just for that back. May the record show that a lot of the purchases on West Maui Land company was not in support of the designation. This gives us more of an opportunity to be a part of the management system.
Is there an opportunity for the Guth’s to meet with the Ohana that meets regularly?
I think that would be a possibility. I don't know it is depending on them. But I know eventually down the road, when there is some kind of consultation with the Historic Preservation that there will involve the lineal the newly recognized descendants.
Okay, thank you very much Keaaumoku. With that do the commissioners have any questions? 
Aloha Chair Chang and Commissioners mahalo for this opportunity to speak. Aloha to the staff as well. I understand how much work went into helping the Guth’s get to this point in their application for theafter the fact permit. But there are a few things that really needs to be clarified there are other end uses that have been included in this application that I don't think should be included in this application. They should be considered on their own. Some of the tax map keys that were cited or at least included in the application initially. I'm not sure if it changed over time. Maybe it got revised. But at least what I'm seeing is as uncle Keaaumoku had mentioned there are several that should be stricken from the application. I feel like some other properties were snuck into somehow some way other people are currently residing in there that have their own diversions on the stream. And also taking water for domestic consumption as well. I'm not sure if that is included in their request. How much they can harvest from the from the river. Whether or not that is included in the Guth’s application. It's supposed to be used for agricultural use. There's a lot of reason to think that some of the people who are residing on adjacent lands have acquired those lands through the Land Company. They are also taking water from the river for domestic use and not necessarily for agricultural use. They have some agriculture but to me the extent is just to show that they're using that as an excuse to take water from the river. Before I go on. I have to clarify that I am a descendant of Emily Haia who owns the Haia terrace. That is her aina. She is my father's mother. I did not seek any lineal descendancy confirmation from any Boards or Commissions of the State. That is my grandmother's Aina so just to clarify I am a hoa‘āina of that place. I currently steward several acres in the valley for other Ohana as well. Land Commission 6621 to Nalehu as well as 8021 that uncle Keaaumoku had already mentioned in his testimony. I am one of the hoa‘āina of those lands. I have to add that I think SHPD presence in the valley is very necessary because it's not just the Haia Terrace. Everywhere you look in that valley there's significance and the fact that the valley was abandoned for so long for over 100 years. The plantations took the water after the overthrow of our kingdom the plantations took the water with the help from the diversion above Kahoma stream. They took the water away from the valley, our family left the valley eventually and the land has been sitting there abandoned for almost 100 years. So, a lot of those lands with respect to what was used by the plantations for sugar operations. I just think that there's other people who are acquiring lands through the Land Company that need to file their own applications. When it comes to the Guth’s application I feel like the Guth’s are extending their application to even include others who are not necessarily serviced by the Guth’s. They have their own diversions. The commission needs to consider that they have their own application reviewed.
Aloha Commissioners and the Chairman. I've never watched a CWRM meeting before my apologies. I am testifying in favor of the Guth’s to get the permit. I am a lineal descendant of the original inhabitant of Kahoma Valley. My tutu was the Konihiki of Kahoma valley and I want to address a couple of things that I've heard. One of them being commercial use. I’m guessing that goes towards the Guth’s using their farm products. They sell it at the farmer's market. So my Ohana was in the valley until 1936 farming kalo. I have pictures and documentation to support this and around the early 1900s to about 1915 Lahaina had a POI Factory. There's documentation of this POI Factory from Lahaina restoration and my ohana sold their Kalo to that POI Factory. In turn my ohana worked also for that POI Factory they were POI Pounders and POI Baggers. They harvested, so there was commercial use coming out from Kahoma Valley from the late 1800s to about 1936 when they finally left the valley. I didn't know the Guth’s until about five years ago in 2018 is when I first met the Guth’s. Their kalo that they grow over there is absolutely amazing and absolutely beautiful they are at the very beginning of the valley. They brought the valley back to life that's what the Guth’s did. I mahalo them so much. I don't understand all the statutes that go into water rights for Kahoma stream. But what I do know because I did the title search for all of the kuleanas in the valley is that with each deed that got passed on. Water rights was passed on to the next person and hence they were passed on to Pioneer Mill then into Kahoma land and then to the Guth’s. I was doing some back research for the Guth’s. I live on Oahu. I came across a deed dated February 1st 1932. It's from Pili Kekai and his wife Marianne John Manuia Kekai who is a widower. They were the children of Kekai and Kekai was the son of Haia who was the original land holder of noncommissioned awards 6541 to Haia which includes the Haia Terraces. On this deed it says that intent to Grant unto Pioneer Mill company the right and privilege of taking any waters from said lands that may be developed in the course of said tunnel excavation and construction. So this particular deed is from that ohana giving Pioneer Mill access through their land for water that was coming from Honokōwai and Kahoma Valley itself. It has a different system of what that value was used for. I also want to bring up so I heard Kapali talking about diversions. Well Kapali's family is squatting on land they're squatting on Nalehu they have no claim to that aina and they are also diverting water. There's diversions in that Valley going all the way up to where Kamehameha schools put the water back in the stream which I am so thankful for. I 100 percent support that effort to make the stream run 100 percent. In regard to Neil Hannahs asking about KS. This area, Kamamalu owns the upper part of that flat part in between Kanaha and Kahoma. The tip is still owned by that Haia family. Kapali is correct his grandma is one of the owners of the Haia. I’ll summarize really quick the Guth’s, Naomi, especially she's a native tenant of Kahoma Valley. I don't think that she should have to apply for a permit but I understand that that is the law now. But based on her rights as a native Hawaiian and based on the fact that commercial use was used in Kahoma Valley to supply taro to the rest of Lahaina. They didn't just do it for free. Yes, there's bartering going around but bartering only went so far and there was monetary use monetary value given to the kalo that was grown in Kahoma Valley. I know that that's a really touchy situation, but I do think that they should be approved because what they are doing provides for all of the community of Lahaina.
Aloha Chair Chang and members of the Commission of Water Resources Management. My name is Eric Meade and I'm a student at the William S Richardson School of Law. In deference to the issues raised by previous testifiers which I believe should be addressed. I support a precedence of waiting of these fines because of the Constitutional priority of water use for traditional and customary native Hawaiian practices. I'm enheartened to hear that the commission is conscientious of the burdens that traditional and customary Native Hawaiian practitioners face. Thank you.
I have a question for Deputy Manuel and Ayron Strauch. Clearly this is an intense situation among neighbors and people who are connected to each other and in same space. But just focusing on what we’re responsible for as the water commission. I’m curious your view on if we approve this after the fact permit, what precedent does it set for both all the hard work we’ve been working on with IIFS and enforcement and the fact that we designated Lahaina as a water management area? We tried, we were leveraging penalties on Olowalu and yes this is a different case but it’s clear from testimony that people value the work of the Guth’s - that’s not the issue at hand.. What we are talking about is the water. So how does this affect our responsibilities to steward resources and mediate conflict? Sorry two things, let’s just focus on stewarding the resource for the stream and the precedence we set as we’re going to be rolling out(inaudible).
I’ll start then Ayron and Dean can jump in. The use that’s described and the quantity that’s described has been evaluated against IFS as indicated in the presentation or the submittal. But the Guth’s are located at the mouth of the valley. So a lot of the other users that have testified are located mauka of them so they wouldn’t necessarily be impacted by the Guth’s diversion of water. The stream does and will continue to flow and the use per Ayron’s analysis is de minimus. I will say within the context of the Commissions regulation of water resources with designation coming forward. This diversion works permit is one process the Guth’s will still have to apply for a water use permit. There’s opportunities for the commission to further evaluate and balance the Guth’s water use with all the other water uses in the valley for in stream and off stream users. So, it’s one step to try to quote unquote clean up the files but the water use permitting process that’s coming this summer, the Guth’s will still have to apply for a water use permit and the commission will reevaluate and balance those reasonable beneficial uses at that time with all other users of this water of Kahoma stream.
Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani in this case once the water was restored in Kahoma valley from the Kamehameha school’s diversion. There was a lot of people that we found out that began diverting water from the stream and that’s something that we’re trying to work through to follow up on. In the case of the Guth’s it’s our understanding that West Maui Land company began selling off land commission awards that are part of a bigger TMK parcel. Some people that are adjacent to the Guth’s begun diverting water from the stream via smaller pumps. Those are some follow up actions that we’ll need to work on. The Guth’s to our understanding is going through a subdivision process. I believe that their LCA’s that they purchased from West Maui Land are in the process of receiving their own TMK parcel numbers and they may be able to speak to that more.
Just to take a broader view. The establishment of interim in stream flow standards to support in-stream uses and repairing uses downstream anticipated the use of water in the riparian zone. The resurgence of traditional customary practices the rejuvenation of ecosystems. We knew this was likely to happen. We just hope that all of these repairing users that are diverting water will go through the necessary legal channels to re- establish those structures if there's actual structures in the channel or pumps. So we kind of anticipated this might happen. Does that help?
Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani- It helps I just want to add a final comment. I think as a commissioner and as kanaka ‘ōiwi, though not from Maui, what I don’t want to do is produce conditions that are going to increase local conflict without a pathway to working through them. We open up a resource and that's stimulating really good things but also there's these people who've been waiting for generations to get access to that and it feels like somebody's jumping in line. I guess if I were to make a motion right now I would want to defer a little bit. Make sure we sort of sort out our understanding of those TMK’s and LCA’s and get people together. Kaleo you've been working at that already but maybe I just want to put that out there because I think people have been waiting long. I'll just leave that comment.
I appreciate that and as a planner and as somebody that similar to chair that supports process is something that I encourage and support. However, we are regulatory body and what we have before us is a request for a permit. I'm trying to honor the applicants process and request and process it within the context of our authorities. A lot of what you talk about is community building and community conversations and to be honest I don't feel comfortable being the one always forcing these conversations to happen. We recommend it. We highly encourage it. We could recommend consultation with, but making things subject to gets really challenging in this context. I hear what you're saying. I hear the testimony from all parties I am working with staff and the applicants trying to present to this to commission what's within our authority and within our space to help facilitate. There's larger systems and policies of how we better encourage community conversations but at this point as cited in the submittal this has been a permit that's been languishing for years. We want to help support especially in this context. Where we have somebody that's doing kalo cultivation customary practices as well as some commercial. But getting them across that finish line to create some hope for movement. That's just my response Commissioner. I honor you as a Commissioner and decision maker and we are here just to recommend decisions to you. Ultimately you make the decision, and we will follow your lead.
Kaleo can you help me with this? The application is for a stream diversions permit. Is that correct?
yes, Commissioner
the applicant, what is his legal access to that diversion?
so, the diversion from what I understand, is a pump along the stream along their parcel.
why is it that in the application, the landowner is unknown?
There are two Parcels basically the stream channels. We've seen other instances and like Honokōhau Valley where that 888 parcel was the TMK Parcel. Were drawn up or digitized originally the 888 was a number sequence that was assigned to these parcels where no landowner was identified so it doesn't belong. It’s not identified as a state or the county, any government entity, or any private entity it's just these outlier parcels where ownership has not been identified.
so, the occupancy and the maintenance of this diversion. Is it sort of a free for all?
well, without doing an exact survey. The understanding is that the pump is on the parcel that the Guth’s own. The streams is these 888 parcels. I guess just the pipes would be going into the stream if that makes sense. Does that answer your question?
well, what does the Guth’s enjoy any kind of long-term standing in maintaining that? or legal access to it?
that I'm uncertain just because there’ll be a land ownership issue there.
well, I guess I mean have we granted these kinds of permits for lands with owner’s unknown to someone to have access to it?
I’m trying to recall if we did one in Honokōhau where the parcel was in a similar situation? Difficult for me to answer that question.
I hear what you're saying right now. There's access the pump and the pipes are accessing the TMK which the stream is located on, and that stream is identified. There's no landowner identified so from our stance or at least in our initial review. We are recommending approval. Unless it's challenged, unless somebody does actually come forward and say that they're the landowner. Therefore permission should be sought through them. For example if it was a State of Hawaii right of entry to access that parcel. Would you have to be granted by the state? But because there's no landowner identified we don't have anybody to determine whether that access is allowed or not.
How much of this stream is in that 888 parcel?
I'd have to look Commissioner. Dean we'd have to pull up the TMK and analyze that.
yeah, I'd have to do a closer look. But I think it’s in the vicinity. Just a rough guess, it's maybe a quarter mile section. There are other portions along the stream that are owned by private entities. For example, just upstream of this is owned by Kahoma land.
and another clarification for me as part of the application. The landowners of the three different TMK’s are listed? What is their participation in the diversion?
The Guth’s maybe better to answer this but as far as we know the Guth’s are the only one’s operating their diversion. There are other pipes or pumps as we’ve seen during our site visits that have been in the stream at times. Between our first site visit to our last one, some of the pipes had changed there were different pipes where on our first site visit some of the pipes were in place, but they weren’t actually diverting either because they had been broken or I’m not sure if they were clogged. But there was no water in them at the time versus when we went this last time. There were additional pipes in the stream different from the ones we had seen prior, and pumps were observed.
And those were all in the 888 parcels?
So again, the 888 is just a small sliver of the stream itself. The pumps that we observed was up on the bank so I'm not exactly sure which parcel that was on. I guess some of those pipes may have been in that 888 parcel.
Are there any other diversion permits other than the Guth’s?
no, we need to follow up on these other diverters. It was kind of a messy situation initially. We didn't really understand what was going on as far as these individual LCA’s within this larger parcel that was being sold off and how we would treat those in that case. In the initial complaint when we looked up ownership we referred to it. I believe it was Kahoma land which is a subsidiary of West Maui Land company. We were talking with the president Peter Martin at the time and his response was, well we sold off these LCA Parcels so you need to talk to those people. So that's the situation we encountered early on.
so, who could sort of provide a little more clarity on the landowners listed as end users? Kahoma Land Company is one of them.
we'd have to work with them to identify the owners through that that had purchased through them.
and the AG is comfortable about allowing us to issue diversion permits to someone that has no legal access?
we haven't been consulted on that issue. If the commission requires advice, we'd want to look into it further.
it's just a matter of comfort. Are we providing the Guth’s with any kind of comfort by issuing a permit?
Hi Cindy a question quick question for you. I'm not an attorney and have you looked into the question of traditional and customary activities being the basis for commercial activity as is the case here. What we've heard earlier today that the law currently does not provide for that and somebody needs to change the law if they want to do that. It really comes to the commission to try to deal with that circumstance. What does the law say right now? Can you clarify that unequivocally for us? 
I just need a minute. We haven’t taken a deep dive into that. I mean if that's your question?
Commissioner Meyer mahalo for the question. I think just for clarity. Staff in our review anybody can apply for extreme diversion works permit so that's what we're processing the analysis and recommendation related to TNC was typed defined. Whether or not we find what's tied to the fact that there's traditional customary practice. I want to bifurcate the conversation that the stream diversion works permits are not only limited to TNC so just making that clear for the record. Anybody can apply for stream diversion works permit but our intent to not fine is because the applicants participate in TNC as well as commercial. Based on that that's why we recommended not fining so that's the context of a TNC.
I understand thanks very much Kaleo. At the same time, what it seems is that we're participating in a scheme to break the law that whether a fine is issued or not; the permit comes into question and question of whether a cease-and-desist order or cease and desist letter is appropriate. I'm not trying to be a hard guy or anything I understand the value out there and understand it pretty well. But I think we have a duty an irrevocable duty to follow the state code and unless somebody can change the law I don't know. Are we in a bind here seems like maybe we are.
I understand it and I appreciate the clarification from Kaleo. The traditional customary practices; the question about commercial is only related to whether we decide to waive the fine or not. So that's separate because anybody's entitled to apply for a stream diversion permit. So, notwithstanding that, the Guth’s may be doing commercial activity. I think it’s the question of traditional customary practices is only related to whether we would waive the fine.
it's ultimately the discretion of this body to decide whether to deny, accept, modify condition. This is your discretion and I think you are acting within the context of the water code to do that.
I'm sorry commissioner Meyer. Are you okay? Do you have any other questions? Are you comfortable?
It seems to me that the question of the permit and the question about fine really is irrelevant given the statements in the code and the laws. I understand it as you explained it as a matter of fact. So, I am uncomfortable with this situation and I don’t like to be in position as a Commissioner; to be looking the other way if you will and by virtue by encouraging other people to do the same. To conduct the same kind of activity. So, I'm uneasy with that. I have been uneasy before and I don't think it seems like we're really doing our job as far as the law is concerned.
appreciate that perspective Commissioner. My understanding is the Guth’s have applied for the permit and so I don't think they're trying to violate; well it's an after the fact permit. But that permit has been pending the application.
Staff we recognize that we've got a long list of things we need to accomplish in doing our work for this commission. And so, you want to dispense with items as they come before the board even though sometimes you don't have perfect information or absolute consensus, or the matter would benefit from community building. We're not resourced to support much more than the current level. We don't want to kick cans down the road where we're just not doing our job and making a decision with less than perfect information. But in this case, I just think there's some things that would benefit from a little bit more time. It's not just as we've said. It's not just for the value of this one permit. It sets some precedence that could be troubling if we move too precipitously. The whole SHPD issue. You've got the commercial use issue, you've got TMK identification issues, and questions which I'm not saying that the concerns are correct or not. It's just that they've been raised today, and I think we would really benefit from leaning in a little bit more on this to see if we can sort some of that out. I would say that with respect to the opportunity for community building. I guess I just kind of said it is an opportunity and not just a duty and that opportunity falls not just to our Commission staff but to the community itself. There are some reasonable people who have spoken on both sides of this issue here, before us today from our community and they're all impressive. Can you guys just talk and I hope the meeting works out so the Guth’s can go to the meeting that meets regularly on Mondays that Keaaumoku has talked about. I hope some of this stuff can get sorted. I hope that our SHPD folks can make a site visit and it seems like we've got some low-hanging fruit that you know can be accomplished in a short order. If things fall out that this bring us closer to consensus and closer to clarity on the issues to address the concerns about precedent setting that may produce unintended . I think we are better off. I don't know how that jams up future schedules of work for the staff or for the agendas of this Commission. But it just feels like we would benefit from a little bit more time and having this come back to us.
Mahalo for that wisdom, Commissioner Hannahs are you proposing a motion?
I’d like to hear the staff’s response to that and then perhaps offer a motion.
I’ll start I’m hearing the sentiment of the Commission as a decision-making body. I'm going to defer and work with the applicants and the community through some of the issues identified. I will say on some other questions raised about ownership and legal issues we'll consult with our AG’s, but I don't know how long or how fast that's going to take, and we can coordinate with SHPD as well. I had no control over them as a sister agency. So, I will say that I am concerned that we're going to continue to move this out and that the Guth’s have been applicants in this process since 2018. So, I just want to acknowledge them for their patience through this process if we decide to defer.
I can give some general information about article 12 section 7. It's basically what chair Chang said. It's reaffirming that the state protects all rights customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence and right of cultural and religious purposes by ahupua’a tenants for descendants of Native Hawaiian. Just to remind you of the provision in your water code which is 174 C -101 that also talks about Native Hawaiian water rights. It doesn't really go to this specific issue but it does talk about Native Hawaiian rights. So, a deeper dive would be needed to answer your specific question. I wanted to give you kind of the framework that the Constitutional provision and your own statute provides.
We know that there are unpermitted diversions across the state not just in Kahoma. We are trying to get them on the books as rapidly as possible. We've been working with the Guth’s and they've been patient with us for five years. They've been moving forward the fastest trying to get their use or their withdrawal of water legal in a sense. As mentioned, upstream of them or at least four other locations. We have documented water withdrawals from the stream that haven't been issued stream diversion works permits. This is just the permit for them to take water. This isn't an allocation of water; this isn't a judgment per se. Just that their use of water is reasonable. That's all I wanted to say.
Just to follow up that the Guth’s have been patient. They have been greatly cooperating to get to this point. I understand that deferring may be a good option just because of these other issues. These other diverters that Ayron mentioned will face similar issues in all likelihood; and to me it makes sense to work through these issues before you folks make a decision; and bring it back to the Commission at a future date.
The issue for instance. Commercial use could take a long time. I'm not sure you're going to get some counsel on that but I'm not sure we want to wait until you totally work that issue through. I mean there's an issue here for the Guth’s benefit we need time to get SPHD over there. Because right now you're looking at a recommendation that requires you to hire a cultural consultant and that's not necessarily what I've heard you want to do; although you can speak for yourself on that issue. I think there's a benefit for you to have us take this time to work through some of these issues; and if you're amenable to that unless you see a great hardship you can speak to this issue of a deferral.
We’re fine with it. Yes, we’re willing to work with SPHD if they’re willing to come over. We would love them to do it.
well, our chair is very persuasive, and she seems to know a guy. So, I think we can make that happen. Chair I would like to move that we defer item C-1. Kaleo is two months good? Have it come back to us within two months so it's not an endless thing?
I wouldn't put a time frame on it just because some of the issues that you brought up might take longer; and I don't know if we can resolve it in two months. We can shoot for two months but that would be May.
we won't be looking for perfect information and total resolution of every single issue. But at least let's take care of the low-hanging fruit that we can resolve; if we can defer this matter to address the concerns that have been raised at this hearing and then bring it back to us as soon as practical.
MOTION: (HANNAHS/KATAYAMA To defer item C1
I think it's headed in the right direction. I would like to ask that we ask the AG's office for clarity on the question of commercial use, and if possible on a priority basis. It seems like it's a narrow enough issue at this point, that somebody ought to be able to write a memo on that and give us proper legal advice; promptly. But I don't know that lies with the AG's office. I'll be happy to support this. I would like to condition this resolution on an opinion from the deputy AG's office.
as a practical matter, pending the final approval or action by the Commission. What happens to the Guth’s? The existing diversion do they continue to use it not use it?
We haven't issued a cease and desist so, a lot of that has to do with crops that have already been planted; and working with them you know, trying to be flexible with a party that's making an effort to comply. If we did do that; there would be lost of crops and so forth so, again from looking at it holistically, the quantity being requested the quantity being used isn't drying up a stream. It isn't necessarily affecting downstream users so at this point in time we're not recommending them to stop using water.
there's no doubt that they have been extremely patient and that they've not intentionally delayed the process. They have been trying very hard to comply and unfortunately government is not moving as quickly as we would all like.
Chair, if you wish to have a motion amended to acknowledge that during this period of deferral the Guth’s shall enjoy continued use of the resource at the current level.
I think that gives them some certainty. I think any questions that people attending this, it puts the impetus on us to move as quickly as possible.
get it sorted out, yes.
commissioner Katayama, Do you agree with that proposed amendment to the motion?
Absolutely.
To defer item C-1 UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED HANNAHS/KATAYAMA/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/MEYER/SETO/BUCK/CHANG
Wait that was for deferral?
yes, for deferral with the condition that the Guth’s can continue to use, pending return to this commission.
Just wanted to make sure this was clear on this record.
you sort of set the tone Commissioner Kagawa Viviani by suggesting that earlier so, with that being said the motion has been passed unanimously. We greatly appreciate the Guth’s for their attendance and for all of those other testifiers who submitted comments both in writing and orally. Thank you very much for participating we are going to take a lunch break and come back at 1:15. So we are in recess.
