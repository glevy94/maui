Approval of Stream Diversion Works Permit Application (SDWP.5971.4) and Special Conditions, Molokai Properties Limited, Abandonment of Stream Diversion Works No. 866.4, to Remove Pipes and Concrete from Stream Intake by Use of Hand Tools, Unnamed Tributary to East Kawela Stream, Kawela, Moloka‘i, Tax Map Key: (2) 5- 4-003:026; and Declare that Project is Exempt from Environmental Assessment Requirements under Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 343, and Hawaii Administrative Rules Chapter 11- 200.1 Deputy Manuel stated the summary of the briefing item to include some recommendations and amendments involving work activities that may impact the environment, particularly water birds and invasive species. The recommendation includes implementing measures to minimize the impact on the environment, seeking concurrence from SHPD for abandonment of diversion, and following the U.S. fish and wildlife service recommendations. He also mentions an amendment to the submittal to declare the project exempt from EA requirements.
I would suggest we consider this with the same amendment regarding the removal of pipes and concrete in accordance with the plans supplied by the applicant within six months and approved by Commission staff.
I did not receive the Earth Justice’s late testimony. I just want it on the record that we don't have those pictures but we're still making decisions.
Chapter 343 of HEPA requires an environmental assessment for actions that may cause significant environmental impacts, triggered in part by presence on conservation lands. Leaving the refuse in the conservation lands may cause environmental impacts and raises a question of whether the project would be exempt from Chapter 343. Cutting up the pipes and carrying them closer to their final destination outside of the Kawela watershed and placing them somewhere outside of that area may make the project exempt from Chapter 343. He suggests that the Commission consider the environmental impact of leaving trash in the forest and not assume that the project is exempt from Chapter 343.
the decision that is being considered by the commission regarding the removal of diversion from a stream, which is evaluated as exempt and appropriate. I believe that the exemption declaration is entirely correct, and that the Commission’s authority does not extend beyond the approved action. If there were other actions to be considered, such as whether to stack materials in a concentrated area, it would also fall under the existing exemption. There may be legal discussions and debates about the grandfathering of the materials but the action being proposed is appropriately declared as exempt and recommended by staff. I acknowledge the opposition from an advocate, but I believe that it does not change the analysis or support for the decision, which is consistent with previous decisions made by the Commission.
Harold’s plan to put the abandoned material on conservation land raises concerns. I suggest that this raises the question of whether it constitutes a violation of OCCL regulations or whether an OCCL permit is required. She implies that if Harold had instead said he was going to remove the material from conservation land, the issue would not arise.
I acknowledge the concerns raised about Harold’s plan to put the abandoned material on conservation land and suggests that the issue falls within the jurisdiction of the Chair of the Commission as well as the BLNR. We can have a conversation with Michael about the appropriateness of the conservation land for the material but does not want the commission to get hung up on those discussions. The current recommendation to submit a plan within six months that is approved by the staff is the appropriate course of action for the commission at this time.
I appreciate that because I think you’re right. If your plan says you’re going to put it on conservation land, we would then ask you for an OCCL consultation.
I’m offering commentary on behalf of Molokai community. The community knows what is best for their own community and should be listened to. It’s important to get our water back and  make things right after years of struggle.
