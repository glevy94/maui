Item C2   
We're gonna now move on to Item C2, Request to Authorize the Chairperson to Enter Into a Joint Funding Agreement With USGS to Collect and Enter Into Site-Specific Water Use Information in Hawai‘i, Statewide. Did this also include the EA exemption, Ayron?   
Yes.   
Okay, and the EA exemption. All right, very good. Presentation by the staff?   
Thank you, Chair. This is Ayron. Strauch with the stream protection management branch. Item C2 is to request to authorize the chairperson to enter into a joint funding agreement with US Geological Survey to collect and enter site-specific water use information for Hawai‘i and declare that the project is exempt from EA requirements. There is no formal presentation, although I will give a little bit of background information. At five-year intervals nationwide, the USGS collects water use data to characterize water use across the nation in a comprehensive and consistent manner for comparative purposes and to make recommendations at the federal level. In Hawai‘i, we've not had sufficient monitoring in major areas of water use for many, many years. We have gotten much better in the last since I was hired in 2014, and the major users such as hydropower and agriculture irrigation have now, at least at the largest scales, are now monitoring their systems much more effectively. There was a lot of information being gathered during the plantation era, but following the collapse of the plantation systems and the managers that we've had to monitor and manage effectively and just record the data, we lost many decades of information. But now, USGS is wanting to gather the information we have and enter it within their system, and they have federal funding to do this. This is a no-cost agreement to.. The commission. We just need to be the local partner in this effort. And because the commission already gathers the data from drinking water systems, both surface and groundwater data from irrigation systems, both surface and groundwater data from (inaudible) power systems, now that we've really worked statewide to get water users to report consistently, this data is now available for USGS to bring into their system to code it to their level of consistency for their federal or countrywide analysis. So with that, the staff recommends that the commission authorize the chairperson to enter into a joint funding agreement between the Commission on Water Resource Management and the US Geological Survey to collect and enter site-specific water use information for the state of Hawai‘i. This JFA will be funded solely by the USGS with no cost to the commission. Authorize the chairperson to accept further amendments and modifications to the contract agreement as may be necessary to accomplish the goals described here, provided that any amendment or modification does not require additional commission funding. Declare that the project is exempt from EA requirements under HRS Chapter 343 and HAR Chapter 11-200.1.
Very good. Thank you, Ayron Commissioners, any questions? Oh, go ahead, Aurora. 
I have one. This is for Ayron because USGS is not here today. How does it  do we have good data even in undesignated areas or  
Yes. 
Oh. 
So from  you know, I won't speak for groundwater, although I do know that they have done a lot of outreach statewide to get small groundwater wells to report, even though I believe domestic wells aren't required to report. Is that accurate? 
Right now, that's not the focus and priority (inaudible). 
Yeah, the focus is on the larger users. 
Okay. 
And we have pretty good reporting from all the larger users. On the surface water side, certain users, we've been getting consistent data for, like East Maui Irrigation or Wailuku Water, because they  that information has been tied to contested cases. Other systems, it's been much more recent. Like Department of Agriculture systems are  on the Big Island or the Molokai irrigation system, they  they were not monitoring their delivery system gathering metered end-use data, so we have that available that dates back now, maybe a decade or so. But the commission staff has installed and maintained monitoring stations for these systems as a  because they weren't gonna be able to do it. So we've also worked with large private irrigation system operators, whether it's Maui Land and Pine, whether it's Grove Farm, Kaua‘i Ranch, Kekaha Ag, which is ABC System, to develop monitoring programs and to help them maintain them. All the hydropower plants now are reporting their tail race data to us, which is a big win because now we have at least one sector of their  you know, the categories that USGS utilizes accomplished. I believe all of the drinking water systems that rely on surface water now also report their water use to us, so 
Okay. So CWRM will ingest it and pass it to USGS to 
Essentially.
organize and display and make available for everyone?
Yes.
And it alleviates the workload in some sense.
The USGS will coordinate with us on how they access the data, whether we set them up with a terminal in the office or we just compile lots of spreadsheets and just send them over there. We'll figure out the logistics later. 
Okay. 
But basically, they're going to fund the gathering and coding and analyzing of the data. 
Okay. The other thing I noticed in the submittal was that there's this untapped source of funding that we could potentially use in the future, the Water Use Data and Research Program, so will that help sustain kind of the effort moving forward? 
That's  *(Laughter.) 
(Inaudible) maybe this is (inaudible).
Yeah, I mean, in general, I will say that Katie Roth with our planning program has been taking the lead on looking at how to double down on our state funding by looking and accessing federal funding where applicable and as appropriate. And so we are evolving in our access of federal resources. We have historically not accessed a lot of them, but that's something that we're open to as they align with our priorities or the things that we've been currently working on.-
I just wanted to say this is great because it's gonna help us through water shortage planning with real data and assistance, technical assistance from USGS.
Any other questions? I'm sorry, Aurora. Go ahead. Anything more?
(Shaking head.)
Any other questions, Commissioners?(No response.)
Do any members of the public, either in the room or on Zoom, have any questions?(No response.)
Okay. With that, do I have a motion?
Motion to approve.
Second.
Motion to approve. Do I have a second?
Second.
The motion has been made and seconded to approve the staff recommendation. All in favor, say aye.(Response.)
Motion passes unanimously. 
MOTION  (KAGAWA-VIVIANI/HANNAHS) To approve C2 with EA exemption.   UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED
