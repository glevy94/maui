Modification of the Boundaries to the Surface Water Hydrologic Units of Hulē‘ia (2046), Māhā‘ulepū (2048), Waikomo (2049), Aepo (2050), To More Closely Align with Topographic Characteristics of the Watersheds, Kōloa, Kaua‘i
Dr. Ayron Strauch, CWRM Hydrologist Staff stated the summary request for the Commission to approve the proposed modification to the boundary of the Waikomo Surface Water Hydrologic Unit on Kauaʻi so that it more closely aligns with watershed delineations utilized by USGS and DAR.
I was just wondering in regards to the Kauaʻi production of what you're doing. Is it the original expansion area that you want replenished or it's been reduced right? The area for the fishing? Am I on the right page? I'm looking at number three, the Kauaʻi one.
I don’t understand the question.
The boundaries, have they been somehow stricken, decreased for the area that you're particularly looking at?
Have you seen the map?
I'm looking at for the surface water hydrologic limits to these areas on Kauaʻi like Waikomo and I'm wondering have you been given a limit and now you want an expansion of the limit to the hydrologic area?
I'll try to frame it. Throughout the State, Dr. Ayron Strauch works with all of our streams and so throughout the State and what the Water Code talks about is us establishing and these hydrologic units, fancy term of what we consider the watershed or the catchment basin for all of our streams. That's an administrative boundary, it's lines drawn on a map of what we consider a hydrologic unit that we manage. The current Waikomo hydrologic unit actually on paper took away some of the streams so there were natural streams that flowed but on paper the line was cut.
So it has been decreased?
I wouldn't say it's been decreased it's just the line that was drawn on paper doesn't actually match what's actually happening on the ground, on the land. What we're trying to do is say in this area use Mānoa as an example. It's like drawing a line through the middle of the valley and saying we're going to split that stream in half. What we're saying is we need to make sure that we manage the stream from its headwaters all the way out to the ocean. Right now as drawn on the map in Kauaʻi it cuts off certain streams on paper and so we're just trying to correct an administrative line that was drawn from the Commission in order to clearly reflect what's happening on the land there in that hydrologic unit. That's all we're doing.
There's no change of water allocation, it's really just the boundaries, making it more consistent with like Kaleo said on paper.
Yes, to match what's happening on the ground.
Does that affect obviously the farmers and the irrigation, what they're growing?
No, this is an administrative management tool that gives us kind of a weight of water budget. How much people use, where their diversions are on the stream, those are built infrastructure and those go through separate permitting and regulatory processes. If you wanted to actually take water out of a stream that you don't have access to, you come to the Commission for a water use stream diversion permit. This action today is purely administrative, it's not actually taking water away, reducing water in any way shape or form. What it’s doing is on paper correcting what's actually happening on land.
I was just concerned if it would take away from communities and cut down on their availability.
No, that's not the action proposed today.
Thanks for the question, are you a resident of Kauaʻi?
No, I'm not.
Oh okay, you seem very interested in Kauaʻi.
I'm interested in the water everywhere.
It's just a comment for Deputy, given we heard about the Kauaʻi Water Use and Development Plan. Can we make sure that this change is communicated?
I will comment that the Water Use and Development Plan is very much focused on the water use side and that the majority of the data and the focus is on potable water. As you can see there was very little attention to surface water or non- potable sources and they were defining everything by groundwater hydrologic unit which is a different administrative boundary.
Getting to what you're saying we will incorporate and obviously communicate with the County in making sure that actions taken by this board are consistent with their water use development plans, that's a given. One of the things that we're trying to continuously work on is the connection between surface water and groundwater and how those are regulated and managed by our agency as well as how that's implemented on the ground by various purveyors. You have in the Hawaii Water Plan context that you presented the Department of Water Supply is developing this water use and development plan but they are one of many purveyors of water. That's where people get confused or oftentimes have issues because a lot of what's presented is focused on their specific systems, not the overall water needs. What you hear is that they struggle getting access to some of that other data whether it's private water systems, irrigation systems, non-potable demands because they are one purveyor of many and they're focused specifically on potable water versus for example the planning department or some other county entity that could access higher level policy data that integrates planning and water resource management. Those are things that we're working on and I think are going to become more important as we look at management throughout the State moving forward. The integration of how do we coordinate surface water IFS establishment which then allows for water to be used for off stream needs that then can sometimes also augment and support groundwater development and groundwater potable source development strategies.
I just noticed that Grow Farm submitted a letter. 
There are over a thousand land owners in the area and we did not reach out to a thousand people to get their input. This is really an administrative issue that we needed to address as we came across it doing data gathering. It wasn't a full-on community engagement needed for this administrative thing. Obviously when we go to addressing actual water sources and water uses and various owners of stream diversion works and reservoirs and irrigation systems we will engage with them and we actually do engage with them pretty much quarterly in the field. We are working hand-in-hand and with them.
I think this is a unique action that people misunderstood what we’re doing here.
I think the people that drew the original lines also divided India and Pakistan.
