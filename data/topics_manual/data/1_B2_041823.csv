Approval of Stream Diversion Works Permit Application (SDWP.5970.4) and Special Conditions, Molokai Properties Limited, Abandonment of Stream Diversion Works No. 862.4, to Remove Pipes and Concrete from Stream by Use of Hand Tools, West Kawela Stream, Kawela, Moloka‘i, Tax Map Key: (2) 5-4- 003:026; and Declare that Project is Exempt from Environmental Assessment Requirements under Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 343, and Hawaii Administrative Rules Chapter 11-200.1
Deputy Kaleo Manuel, CWRM Deputy Manuel stated the summary of the briefing item to include some recommendations and amendments involving work activities that may impact the environment, particularly water birds and invasive species. The recommendation includes implementing measures to minimize the impact on the environment, seeking concurrence from SHPD for abandonment of diversion, and following the U.S. fish and wildlife service recommendations. An amendment was made to declare the project exempt from EA requirements. He asks that the same recommendation is made for item B-3 as well.
are we removing the abandoned pipes and concrete from the stream channel?
there seems to be, I don’t know if there’s confusion or that something just the public testimony wasn’t unsure of, but we should make sure we’re really clear about that at least in our minutes at a minimum.
the intent of that is to remove, basically get rid of, the abandoned diversion and remove the pipes and the concrete from the stream itself.
we have so much rare opportunities to actually restore streams, and this is the one on Moloka‘i that we picked, so I think it's really important in this context.
we are available for any questions the Commissioners may have.
How long has the ranch been utilizing this diversion?
I have to guess it's probably in the neighborhood of 80 years or more. I think they’ve been around quite some time.
do you guys have to hike in or fly in and does it include plans to completely remove it from the site?
it'll be a matter of hiking in, and everything will be moved away from the stream bed and stored at some appropriate place off-site.
okay, I've had to fly out concrete blocks from Makaha and that was one of the concerns raised in written testimonies so just being clear that that's part of the plan.
asks that Harold clarify his statement; when you say off-site you mean out of the stream area for possible use in a reactivation of another location. I just want to make sure that we are clear with the Commission in light of the public testimony.
thank you for that clarification. Correct.
removal offsite is not one of the conditions?
our recommendation and priority is the diversion within the stream channel, that's where we focus on. Based on testimony and the conversation, you folks want to recommend that could be taken off site then that's fine, but that's not within what we're recommending. We're just focusing on removing the actual diversion from the stream and the pipe out of the stream so it can no longer divert water. That's within the purview of this body, the Water Commission. =Maybe we can address that after everyone testifies.
She is a born and raised resident of Kawela and a member of Molokai No Ka Heke. She expresses her support for the action to rectify the mess caused by old pipes and diversion materials in the area. She requests clarification on what “removal” means and suggest that it should involve properly disposing of these materials outside of the forest. She believes this is a small step in the right direction towards fully restoring Kawela. 
An attorney from Earth Justice representing an organization that filed a petition in 2019 to amend flow standards for the central Moloka‘i streams. He asks that the ranch be compelled to go through the formal abandonment processes for the specific purpose of cleaning up many of the derelict pipes that are left unused. He expresses concern about the permit’s unclear language regarding on-site storage for disposal and the need to clarify whether any of the pipes could potentially be reused and stockpiled for future use. The Kawela watershed, where the pipes currently sit, is not the same watershed as the intakes that are being considered for potential future reactivation. He suggests that MPL has a facility a little bit further down the road where the various intake pipes converge into a warehouse and could be a logical place to store unused pipes. He also mentions that the East Kawela dam around to the East Kawela tributary intake, and the vast bulk of that pipe is not within the stream bed but instead just laying along the access trail. Finally, he expresses concerns about leaving the pipes on-site and suggests that the pipes should be taken somewhere they can sit with MPL’s other stuff if they are going to be reused. He also submitted written testimony including pictures.
He would like to ask the commission to urge MPL to remove their rubbish from our streams and our riverbeds up on our mountaintops. He feels really sad to see things up there that don't belong. Growing up his mother was a lei crafter so they would go to the mountains to go pick different flowers and ferns to make leis for graduation and special occassions. His mom had no daughters to pass this tradition onto so, he took it upon himself to carry on the tradition and pass it on to his kids.
He just asked that MPL takes out their rubbish from our mountains.
As a community member, asked that the MPL dispose of their rubbish out of East and West tributary. Also think it's dangerous to have old metal and pipes on public access trails.
Testifies on behalf of the community of Molokai and expresses her disappointment with MPL’s management of the land. She states that it has been a year since they agreed to clean up and restore the land, but nothing has been done. She emphasizes the importance of responsibility for landowners to take care of their land for the future of Molokai.
The State Ala Hele trail system runs through the mountains where the pipes and derelict materials are located, and the Molokai community often accesses these areas through that trail. The last picture shared yesterday showed Kahekili and Kamaki walking next to a pile of rubbish on the trail.
She expresses concern about the derelict pipes that have been sitting in the area for a long time and have no use. She doesn’t understand why they’re still there to begin with and suggests that MPL team up with the community to dispose of the rubbish properly. She has passed by their disposal site on numerous occasions and describes it as a messy and lazy way to dispose of the rubbish. She believes that hauling the pipes out of the area is common sense and that MPL should be able to bring them right back down. She concluded by stating that it’s unfortunate that the Water Commission has to order MPL to pick up their own rubbish, as it goes against what we are taught from a young age about picking up after ourselves.
thank the community and the applicant for testifying and taking action to close the diversions down. Removing pala and returning the property in the condition it was received or better is standard practice. I propose inserting a recommendation to remove the pipes and concrete in accordance with a plan approved by commission staff and to ensure that any proposal to reuse the materials is credible and stored appropriately. I trust staff to evaluate the proposal and ensure proper storage.
I guess I would take that one step further. I don't know if we even need a plan. My fear is liability, it's in the Ala Hele trail that's adjacent to that. I would believe that MPL, Cal, and your team see that this is appropriate to remove property from the state lands. All the abandoned infrastructure that was part of that stream diversion.
He appreciates the suggestion but doesn’t believe it's within the commission’s jurisdiction to order removal of the materials beyond the stream area. He invites Harold to explain why the materials may be appropriate for reuse and why stacking them away from the stream but on MPL-owned property is appropriate instead of moving them down. He also emphasizes the importance of staying within legal jurisdiction.
Molokai Ranch is the sole owner of the land in the forestry area, and not state land. It is difficult to access the area and there is a high cost of using a helicopter. The Ranch hopes to comply with the Water Commission’s intent without incurring excessive financial costs. Removing all surplus pipes is time and resource constrained and materials that cannot be reused could be removed gradually over time. There will be significant effort required to access and remove materials from the project site.
Harold can you further comment on the potential to reuse if Kamoku was reactivated.
the black pipe that was referred to earlier is HDPE pipe and it could be cut into smaller links to be handled and then refused and used quite happily one ridge over, rather than taking it all the way out and having to pack it all the way back in. When the time came to hopefully reactivate the Kamoku intake.
I suggest an amendment that if the pipes are planned to be reused, they should be stored in a manner that does not affect safety along the trails or any of the trails used for these traditional and customary practices. The concern is about the impact of storing pipes and equipment on the access for gathering and the need to access these resources.
for MPL, we'd be fine with that recommendation. And frankly fine with Commissioner Hannah's recommendation that we submit a plan to staff that incorporates the science those kinds of guarantees.
thank you chair, that was sort of my question for Kaleo. Is that in the staff submission the landowner is listed as MPL so, I think that was clear. My other question is what is the range of public access to this area? Is it limited to the trail? Is it a sort of free-ranging access? If you could clarify that and then my last question is how far beyond the stream does the commission have the right of governance?
I understand the legal questions surrounding access to private land and our job is to ensure that if anyone is gathering lei material in the forest, we support and ensure it happens within their jurisdiction. We can make feasible recommendations to protect the public trust, but within the context of the Water Commission’s authority; the diversion works permit and the actual materials used are usually within their authority. The potential amendment to store the pipes in a way that doesn’t affect health and safety along the trails is in alignment with their public trust duties.
but the suggestion that we have the ability to govern the precise placement and use of these materials once removed. Is that covered within our authority?
I'm not governing that at all. My proposed recommendation is to ensure that materials are not stored in a way that blocks trails or impacts health and safety when access is needed. The proposed recommendation is in line with the commission’s obligation under the code and the Constitution to remove diversions, but in a mindful way. I’m open to the AG’s providing further guidance on the matter.
Does a landowner have any right to acquire enjoyment of his property?
The land in question is private property, and the testimony received is related to access. Under Article 12 Section 7, access to undeveloped lands is protected for Native Hawaiians. The proposed language is not meant to impose specific requirements on the landowners, but rather to protect their right to access. The amendment is to ensure that materials are stored in a way that does not impact health and safety on the trail. The focus is on managing the practice while protecting the right to access.
Okay good Kaleo, thank you very much. That’s helpful.
I am guilty of holding onto items that I think I will reuse someday, just like the pipes. If there is a permit or a plan to reuse the pipes, it makes sense to move them to the site efficiently. However, without a plan, they could sit there for a long time.
The decision to reactivate Kamoku hasn’t been made yet, and the request of the Water Commission to remove all pipes out of the stream could create a financial burden on the ranch. I suggest allowing the ranch to take care of the pipes and only revisit the issue if there are concerns about how they are stored. He does not want to create more burden on the ranch than necessary.
It’s currently our authority to permit these structures and in permitting them I think we can condition what happens when they are removed when they are no longer allowed.
I’m going to defer to legal counsel on that one.
we are discussing the potential reactivation of Kamoku and the request from the Water Commission to remove the pipes from the stream. I suggest that the request could be met with several mandates of effort rather than creating a financial burden on the ranch. The lifetime of the improvement and the use of the material should be considered. The need to condition the removal of structures when they are no longer allowed and the potential to reuse the pipe at Kamoku for the reactivation of the diversion. I agree with the suggestion to require a plan that staff approves and commit to not stacking the pipe in a way that impacts health.
no, maybe you make a recommendation. I think we've learned the hard way with all due respect. It's really hard to micromanage things on site. I support Commissioner Hannah's recommendation with a plan approved by the staff. The minutes are very clear. I have total trust in the Molokai community that if they're not happy with what they see they will come back to us. And I truly believe maybe this is a dream Molokai Ranch is trying to improve their relations with the local community they're going to do the right thing. So, I would move to approve item B2 with the amendment that a Commissioner Hannah’s recommended.
I don't think we're ready for our motion just yet.
if the area under consideration is in a conservation district and confirms that it is based on the submittal. My personal experience as a master’s researcher working on Kamehameha lands, where they had to adhere to certain rules when pouring concrete. With the decommissioning of telescopes on Mauna Kea it is possible to organize Heli-ops to transport materials, and I know from my own experience coordinating with a watershed partnership. The materials may be grandfathered in, but I encourage the Commission to consider ways to leave the place better in the spirit of stewardship. I appreciate the steps already taken in that spirit, particularly regarding the water and lands of Moloka‘i.
I believe that the Water Commission needs to balance the interests under Ka Pa‘akai and have heard from the community about traditional customary practices being exercised in the area and people with lineal connections to the place. I believe that appropriate mitigation measures should  be adopted, such as the removal of the pipes, and suggests that the Moloka‘i Properties prepare a plan approved by the staff but would like to see a deadline to ensure timely removal. Harold and Cal, when do you think you could remove the pipes?
obviously the good weather days. I would think the time limit of like six months or less would be reasonable.
that makes sense and I suspect that many of the people that testified today might even be willing to help.
that’s a good chance, I would say.
this is the beginning of a cooperative relationship. I have a hunch they would probably expedite this even quicker than six months, but I think six months seems to be reasonable. This may be an opportunity to create a bridge with these community members to work hand-in-hand with Molokai Properties to make them whole and bring this place back.
I'm prepared to make the motion that we adopt the recommendation of staff with the amendment that the removal of pipes and concrete be in accordance with a plan submitted by MPL and approved by commission staff within six months.
also, to accept staff's amendments to section 2 related to the declaration of exemption.
(HANNAHS/BUCK) To adopt the recommendation of staff with the amendment that the removal of pipes and concrete be in accordance with a plan submitted by MPL and approved by commission staff within 6 months.
