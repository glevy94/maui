Staff recommended revisions to the delegations to approve well and pump permits, set by the Commission at its December 19, 2023 meeting, after the Commission’s directive to consult with the Departments of Water Supply.

## QUESTIONS / COMMENTS

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** Just to summarize then, basically any household domestic wells are below the line. That's why you picked the 27 (gallons per minute), right?

**RYAN IMATA:** Yeah.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** And second, even if the delegation is given, in individual cases, that still comes to the Commission. When for example, what you're talking about, there’s a cross between aquifers and surface water, etc. It's not an absolute delegation, it's sort of a routine delegation with exceptions, when things arise on a particular application.

**RYAN IMATA:** Yeah, I was trying to identify any permits in the 27 years that I've been here, looking at where I think that there are going to be concerns. I would love to focus more of our effort on where I think that there are potentials for impacts to other resources or other users or traditional and customary practices or whatever. I think this is a good balance between filtering out things like individual domestic uses where the use is so small, relative to sustainable yield, but bringing to you the issues that are much bigger.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** Thanks, Ryan, for this. I’m trying to read the esoteric document that is the Hawai‘i Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards. I notice it was revised in 2004, but that's not referenced. You told us about the establishment in 1997, is there anything to note about that 2004 revision? I'm just going to say approval by the chairperson was noted about 40 times, so there was a lot of delegation already in that document. Can you kind of explain?

**RYAN IMATA:** I can't speak to the specifics of the differences between the 1997 and 2004 standards, but I know at the time that we first implemented the standards, we were having a lot of comments from drillers and developers and I think just the general public about things that needed clarification. I don't think the 2004 standards necessarily revised anything from a policy procedural standpoint, I think it was more details about construction, construction details that were amended. The delegations in and of themselves were kind of a clarification of the more routine things that we do, and not specifically permit delegations. I hope that answers your question.
