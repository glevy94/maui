Hill Shaft Recovery and Monitoring, and Monitoring Well Development and Water Data. I think General Hashimoto, you are at the table. Again, thank you very much. This is the second update to the water commission. We have greatly appreciated the Navy appearance before the commission intended to provide us some good information about the current status of your -- the cleanup at Red Hill. So go ahead, General Hashimoto, and if you could also introduce your staff.

GENERAL HASHIMOTO: Aloha, Chair Chang, Deputy Chair Manuel, Commissioners, Ladies and Gentlemen. My name is Major General Mark Hashimoto, and I represent the United States Indo-Pacific Command. And mahalo for this opportunity to provide updates on matters that are directly related to the water itself and that are also forward-looking. We are going to provide updates on Red Hill site remediation and closure, shaft recovery and monitoring, and monitoring well development, as well as water data.

As Chair Chang mentioned, the last time we were here was the meeting on March 21st. During that meeting, we had a few follow-ups to -- besides providing a general update periodically, and those had to do with soil vapor extraction, as well as GAC flow optimization, so those will be covered as well as a general update as part of today's brief.

What I'd like to start with before we get into the specifics of the agenda item is I'd like to have the Joint
