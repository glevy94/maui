Minutes  

**COMMISSIONER MIKE:** It's the exceptions? I don't understand that at all. Here we are, we have had the delegation for what, 27 years? Nothing has come up about that. There was always the flexibility of the Chair when he or she and most of the time it's been a she, have had concerns about that was brought to the Commission for us to decide. I guess because the issue has been raised, we got to find out whether it is rulemaking or not, but from my point of view it doesn't make any sense that this is now all of a sudden the rulemaking issue has raised its head.

**COMMISSIONER HO:** I totally agree with that, but for me it's the public has raised this issue as well as some of the Commission members and so it is an easy fix for us to just seek the counsel of the Attorney General's office and then we could put a period on it. Because of these cases, these lines of cases, it is not rulemaking and therefore you could go forward on your action. If we don't get that response, the opinion from the Attorney General's office, it will always be a question out there whether it is or isn't. For me, it would be a simple question to the AG's office that they can answer quickly, do the analysis of those cases, and say what we're doing is not illegal rulemaking.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Because Kathy, in your view, if it was just a pure delegation to the Chairperson, there would be no issues. It's the rulemaking is these conditions, these exceptions. I think in the past, Larry, the delegation has just been a blanket delegation so that's why I don't think the rulemaking issue has come up in the past because it's been total discretion to the First Deputy and the Chairperson.

**COMMISSIONER MIKE:** The issue of rulemaking will be germane only if someone challenges it. If nobody says anything about it being a rulemaking, the only way that the issue would come up is if someone sues the Commission to say you're doing illegal rulemaking.

**CHAIR CHANG:** But then it could potentially make us vulnerable in all of the actions that we've taken.

**COMMISSIONER MIKE:** Wait a second, on what actions? Is it the ones that we just routinely had delegated or the ones that the exceptions were made because if it's only the exceptions that are rulemaking, it's only the exceptional cases that would be subject if the suit was successful that said you were doing illegal rulemaking. All the others, from what I understand the issue is, would be okay, right? All the ones that would be routinely approved would be okay because that's not rulemaking. Anyway, since now it's been so befuddled, how quickly can we get an answer from the Attorney General's office? Tomorrow will it come?

**CHAIR CHANG:** Can you do a subject to? Is there an option to approve this, subject to review by the Attorney General?
