how innovative and how unusual and how profound the Water Code is. And he's really sort of come with that understanding that it means a huge deal to walk into a role of having to try and implement and uphold that.

That relates to my second thing that I wanted to highlight about his tremendous service is that I certainly have not always agreed with some of the decisions that he's made, but unlike some other people I've observed over three decades, there was never a question in my mind that, first and foremost, he understood the duties of a trustee which first is duties to be faithful to the trust corpus itself. He -- I might have disagreed with the decision he reached, but it was always in trying to further what was best for the resource and best for the implementation of the code, and that really increased the amount of trust that this body has had over the time of his service.

And finally, this is also something he remarked on, his continual drumbeat about us needing to connect how we manage our forested watersheds and how we manage the water derived from them is an incredibly important message, and I think that as we slowly make progress on that over the next years and decades, his voice in the wilderness will be one that will continue to guide us and be seen as a guiding light in that process.

So I'm just personally very, very grateful for your
