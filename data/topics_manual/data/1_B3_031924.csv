PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Dr. Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Branch Staff stated the summary request which is to approve Stream Diversion Works Permit Application (SDWP.5991.6) submitted by East Maui Irrigation Company, LLC (EMI) that proposes to abandon specified Stream Diversion Works and to remove pipes and seal intakes to restore flow on the Makanali, ʻOʻopuola Tributary, ʻOʻopuola, West ʻOʻopuola Tributary, Oanui, Waipiʻo, and Hoʻolawa Streams, Maui.
Ayron, there are 20 something streams affected by our East Maui decision, so how many more are coming? Is this it in terms of what needs to be done or is it phased work?
These are all the diversions that are being abandoned. The permits for modifications was approved in June of last year, I believe, and that work is still forthcoming because they’re subject to other permits such as SMAs (Special Management Areas) or CDUP (Conservation District Use Permits) or Army Corp concurrence, that sort of thing. The Commission has already approved modifications to stream diversions in the Huelo area and these are the approvals for abandonments of the remaining diversions associated with that 2022 decision.
After this, this will be all the infrastructure work that needs to be done to effect our ruling?
I believe so.
There is one more application that is still pending, I believe the agency review period just wrapped at the end of last year. We should be preparing that submittal for you shortly.
And that’s for what? 
To modify a number of about 15 diversions in the same Huelo area. That should be the last of it. We will also be coming back to you to report on the category four diversions which were from the prior action further east, specifically for the Waiakamilo hydrologic unit.
Aloha Chair and Commissioners. Thank you for hearing this, we appreciate all the hard work of the CWRM staff in really taking on this project and we stand with their recommendations on the submittal.
My name is Lucienne de Naie, I’m representing the Maui group of the Sierra Club. I’m also a Huelo resident that lives in this area and is familiar with many of my neighbors who live in this area and their uses of these various streams. Sierra Club did ask for these streams to be restored several years ago and grateful for the approval of the Commission; however, it has been very difficult to track the process. You notice no public comments, you notice no comments from Aha Moku Council. We have requested from the very beginning even on those streams that you approved on January 30th, the category 1, that there be a community site visit. Seeing is believing my neighbor Moses Kahiamoe, Sr. says and there’s truth to that. Seeing little pictures and charts with confusing numbers and two sets of numbers, it’s called this, it’s called that, the public cannot participate. I’m sorry, that’s only for policy wonks. You really need to stand there at a place where people may be familiar from going with their families and look and say, here’s what we’re planning to do here, is this kind of what you folks were hoping would help things? We’ve had years to do this. We waited several years, there’s just been no outreach. We are happy to reach out to people in the community and organize these kinds of accesses, we’ve done so before with Ayron, it’s turned out very well. You get useful comments, you find out what’s really going on. It should be a standard condition, everything that is being requested in the Huelo area and our intention is not to delay this permit. This site visit should have been offered before this meeting. This site visit should be offered after this meeting as a condition if it hasn’t been before because there’s still more permits coming up that require Army Corps, we’re being told. We participate in these quarterly meetings, they are very confusing, the time frame is very compressed, many different agencies need to report. There’s tiny little pictures that flash on your screen. We continually ask, please let us just stand there and look at these places. It’s not too much to ask, it’s a respectful thing for we are an applicant in a way, the Sierra Club is because we ask for this to be done. One of our board members lives right by Hoʻolawa Stream, one of our Sierra Club Maui group board members. She asked me, what’s being planned? I go, God it is so confusing I’ve asked for a site visit so someone can explain it to us. Even the staff didn’t realize there were still more permits to do. We need a time sheet, we need a spreadsheet that shows what is in this phase, what is in that phase. We’ve requested that, it has not been delivered. We understand the staff is really busy but we are willing to help set up some sort of a visit and seeing is believing. If we can see what’s proposed, we can really offer meaningful comments. Also, we are confused over which intake on Waipiʻo Stream number 8, L8 or L9 is actually meant by 238. On one staff report from 2022 it’s said to be Lowrie Intake 8, on the most recent one it’s said to be Lowrie Intake 9. They’re very different intakes, this is the one that requires the overpass. We’d sure appreciate knowing more what’s going on. We appreciate that these are being approved and moved forward and modifications made but gosh we live there, these things are in our backyard and the cultural impact documents that are offered are fragmented. Often, no questions were asked about these particular streams or diversions. We want to have a good process, we want to have a speedy process. Aha Moku reps would come to a community meeting, they live right in the Community, community members who live and depend upon these streams would come to a site visit but it’s very hard to hike to these places on our own. The roads are bad, there’s gates, there’s no key provided for our community use. If you drive an all-terrain vehicle, you can get to them fairly easily so you could have a very successful site visit if access were allowed that was driving access and the community was invited and those who could show up on that day would show up. Please, please, please make that a condition of every permit in the Huelo area. A thousand people live in the Huelo area, it’s not unoccupied...
Can I ask, Mark, is that possible?
I think that’s pretty much up to the Commission and the staff. For the majority of these, I think there have been visits, there just haven’t been recent visits, but they are aware of what’s going on out there.
There’s something to be said about an independent assessment and I mean in the long run, I think this community needs to work with EMI. I do see some value. Commissioners, do you have comments or anything additional you want to add?
I don’t want to delay the abandonment process, but maybe Lucienne, it would be best to go ahead and do it and then you guys go and check all these thing to see whether it’s been accomplished.
We can’t get access easily.
That’s what I’m saying is that if they do the abandonment then you guys go over there and look it over and see whether it’s done, what was supposed to be done and whether you people have any kind of suggestions if there’s something else to be done.
Commissioner Miike, when I bring this up with EMI, they go, it’s up to the commission. So, the ball is in your court to tell EMI to please do this. I’m sure they will comply, otherwise they don’t think it’s their kuleana.
What I’m asking is that if we do put this as a condition, would you be happy with that? But to go ahead now and do the abandonment and go and then you guys go in and check?
Yes, I already stated we have no wish to hold this up but please you have another set of permits coming up so make it that before you see those, there also needs to be a community site visit so that our only choice shouldn’t be holding things up in order to have something that we’ve requested over and over and over again. We requested this on category 1 permits that were approved in January. I couldn’t make it to that meeting and let you guys know that. It’s just sad. We requested it in 2020 for those permits.
What I understand you’re saying, you have no objection to Commissioner Miike’s recommendation or comment about making this a condition after that the community can see whether the abandonments have been completed.
We would actually like a site visit before they are started, not to hold them up, but to understand what is being planned before it’s done.
Given the logistical access challenges, is something like drone footage that gets a little bit further away from looking at the specific structure be helpful? I’m just saying this because I know it would be for me, trying to visualize where and what is going on.
Possibly, but that’s a lot of commitment time. We have to have a community meeting to view the drone footage and then if people have questions what are you going to say? Well, we can’t go up and see it, they won’t let us go. It’s better to stand there with people who have lived here all their lives and have them look at it and you can drive to all of these places.
I understand the community, is that 1, is that 10, is that 20, is it 50? If we had a representative that and a representative of the community would accompany CWRM staff and the applicant to ensure that these the conditions have been complied with?
You should have several representatives because each stream is different and you can’t expect one person to know every stream well, it’s not fair.
Do we, the commission, have the regulatory authority to require an applicant to do something like this or do we just strongly encourage the applicant in a letter to embrace the community’s concerns? I just don’t know if we have that regulatory authority to require the applicant to do something. We could maybe have as a part of the application process, make the applicant go through a community meeting, but I guess that’s a question for the lawyers.
I don’t see anything that it’s a requirement, but if CWRM needed more information or something then that’s one thing.
What I’m also hearing, Mark, if it’s a condition you’re more apt to do it versus I don’t get a feeling that you’re going to voluntarily do this.
It’s not that we’re withholding this opportunity, I know just over the years there have been multiple visits to some of these areas but discussions like this hadn’t been had at that time. CWRM staff has been there, Lucienne has been there, we haven’t all been there together talking about exactly what is happening. That’s, I think, what she’s looking for, but to entertain something like that we have to limit the group size so that it’s easier to get around, it’s easier to move, it’s easier to access. I do understand that and I think representatives of the community, certain representatives, absolutely. If that’s something that they’re looking for and you’re going to make it a condition of this permit, then we’re willing to comply. I just know that this has been done before.
I just wanted to add that most, not all, of these sites are easily accessible. One you have to walk down the stream channel maybe a thousand feet, that’s the Ohanui one, unless a new trail is blazed. Not Ohanui, Old Hāmākua one. The Waipiʻo site, the current landowner because the land ownership has changed, the current landowner does not want people on the parcel and correct me if I’m wrong, Mark, but even EMI staff have been threatened on that parcel. I would say of the seven, five are easily accessible but these are still not ADA (Americans with Disability Act) accessible. It’s a fairly narrow road. I could lead a group of five to all of these in half a day if we were diligent about sticking to the task. That is not a hard ask.
Part of this is building trust and the community having to independently verify has there been compliance. I think it is something worthy to consider, but I also understand liability issues, I understand issues related to size of the group, so some kind of compromise.
May I speak, Chair Chang to address some of your concerns? Sierra Club has a liability insurance policy.
Is that to your members, Lucienne?
It covers anyone on any of our activities so our activities are not limited to our members so this can be considered an official site visit activity. The insurance policy, the liability, is to cover the landowner, not the participants, so the landowners are covered on that liability. The community could agree to limit the number of participants but we would need to make sure that there were people that knew about the various streams that we were visiting. That’s all. These other past visits that we’ve had, we had one visit that was part of a contested case where several community members, like about six, and Mark and one of his staff people and Mike Kido who was a biologist who was looking at the streams went. We had no idea what was being proposed for any of those streams at the time, so you’re not looking at that, you’re just looking at the stream conditions in general. It’s kind of like not on the same topic so this would be the first visit where what is being proposed is being looked at on site at the streams, for the record. I appreciate Ayron’s suggestion and I think it would be very workable.
I would think a reasonable number of people would be like three or so for one vehicle, passengers, and that sort of thing. It would certainly cut down on the intrusion and be much more easily scheduled. I don’t know, Mark, what you and Sean think about that in terms of group size or Ayron for that inspection?
I think two vehicles at max, so whatever we can fit into two vehicles.
There you go, thanks Ayron. That makes good sense to me and I think there ought to be those parameters, they ought to be agreeable. I don’t know if they need the Commission’s intrusive presence on that, but certainly we have some thoughts here that are on the table the Commissioners could deal with.
I wasn’t around for the EMI decisions, but I think it’s a neat opportunity to change the tenor of what’s been happening on East Maui. Having Ayron there, the things we see in pictures but pointing it out, I know I really valued the crazy day trip out there and being on site. To have Mark and other representatives of the community with Commission staff to explain what’s been done, what’s been planned and actually a large part of it is also in the drive on the way where that dialogue can be outside of the three-minute testimony and hearing space, I think could be very helpful for longer term. I was going to ask Dean about the quarterly meetings, maybe they haven’t been as helpful so this is a complimentary action. I’m kind of hopeful and interested and excited about the possibility of this.
This was requested at the last quarterly meeting. If you look at the tape you will see and frankly I think five people is more practical because you might have a driver of our vehicle who may just be a driver and provide the vehicle.
I don’t want to get too much into the details, but I do see value and it’s probably helpful maybe for Mark if we gave him cover, that we made it a condition because EMI isn’t the only one where this is going to come up. West Maui, almost wherever we have issues, I think it is helpful seeing the place, having an independent assessment by the community, verify. I think it does move towards trust as well as towards ensuring that there is compliance.
The decision and order was meant to reconcile a contested case that was dividing our community so we took actions to do that and part of it is what’s happening in the streams with terms to water flow, with respect to infrastructure, but it’s also how we build community. I think you’re spot on in terms of let’s not miss the opportunity to create stronger relationships in managing this very important resource by the many stakeholders who are involved. It’s kind of hard to think about that as a condition, I just wish it would happen. I do get that on one hand, Mark is willing but there may be some other landowners who you need some leverage over and so if our decision helps give you, this is a requirement of the Water Commission for the management of this infrastructure and these streams, then I’m happy to vote for that.
If I might suggest again Mark and Sean and Ayron as well, an important element here aside from the insurance policy is individual release and indemnities that are absolutely mandatory in this kind of situation for a landowner. Any participants, I would think, would be required and should willingly provide release and indemnities on acceptable form. Shifting gears for a second, Ayron, I’d like to ask under the conditions where the ditch is under a grated intake because you mentioned the rebar and bedrock and the extensive heavy equipment work that might be necessary to remove these. Has it been considered to perhaps deal with these grated entries over the ditch condition being resolved with a steel plate being fabricated which fit and perhaps was attached with bolts that would be perhaps less intrusive, certainly a lot less expensive? I mean moving heavy equipment to jackhammers and demolition equipment into areas like this is first of all it’s very expensive and difficult, but it also does some damage in its own right. Might it not be easier to deal with those conditions? I think there are a few with just a steel plate application.
Most of these locations are fairly accessible in terms of distance from a drivable, passable road so I think pneumatic drills or whatever could be used. In terms of grates that are flowing over ditches that were acting as stream diversions, I think sealing them whether it’s through concrete or steel plate, I think it might last a little bit longer but that’s up to the applicant. The bigger issue is the concrete walls that dammed up flow to generate the head necessary to get the water into the ditch. In other circumstances, if they are existing on the ditch itself a very careful amount needs to be removed but also not damage the infrastructure. That’s where the applicant is going to do their best to remove as much as possible and we’re comfortable with the amount that they propose to remove. In theory, the entirety of it, but again we understand that there might be some that is not removable simply because it’s integral to the ditch.
I realized it’s a site-specific individual piece by piece analysis but thanks for sharing that.
I want to renew my concern about whether we have the authority and I make a motion to go into executive session.
MOTION: (HO / HANNAHS) To enter Executive Session to confer with its attorney under HRS 92-5(a)(4).
UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED (MIIKE/KATAYAMA/HANNAHS/CHANG/MEYER/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/HO)
We’re back from executive session. We conferred with our Deputy Attorney General on our duties, privileges, and liabilities and immunities related to item B3.
I’d like to apologize for wasting everyone’s time. If a site visit prior to this is going to be able to move things forward in a way that’s going to be more collaborative than between myself and Dr. Strauch and whomever else on the CWRM staff, we’ll arrange something. I apologize for wasting everyone’s time in executive session.
It was a good discussion.
Nope, no wasting anybody’s time. You had us think about this, but greatly appreciate your willingness to do that and offering that. Based upon what we heard, Mark is willing, EMI, to work with Dr. Strauch and the community to facilitate a site visit.
Mark mentioned it’s like a before construction and I think there was an interest in maybe a compliance site visit. Commissioner Miike is shaking his head, so go with what we got.
MOTION: (HANNAHS / KATAYAMA) To approve staff recommendation as submitted.
UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED (MIIKE/KATAYAMA/HANNAHS/CHANG/MEYER/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/HO)
