MR. ARAKAKI: Sediment shouldn't be released. Whatever gets in here, the -- the city's design criteria is not to treat the -- peak flow, you know, whether it's the ten-year or -- or larger storms.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Okay. So it sounds like a conversation with the city.

DEPUTY MANUEL: Yeah, I mean -- yeah.

MS. YOUNG: Russell, can I add to that?

MR. ARAKAKI: Okay. Doraine Young is on.

CHAIR CHANG: Okay.

MS. YOUNG: Okay. I'm Doraine Young, and I'm with Engineering Concepts. Sorry, I was having problems with my camera. But I wanted to add that the reason why the city chose a one-inch rainstorm is that's usually 80 percent of the runoff that occurs. So that's the reason why the one-inch storm is used.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Yeah.

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Makes perfect logic, right? Eighty percent of the runoff.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Probably. Eighty percent of the runoff happens two percent of the time, you know, so, yeah. I mean, if the coral's getting blanketed, it's happening at the high end. So that sounds like a good conversation to have across the city (inaudible).

DEPUTY MANUEL: Yeah. I think it'll be good to talk
