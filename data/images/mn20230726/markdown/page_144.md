sustainable agricultural pilot project, as well as restoration of Kuapā Pond.

So moving now into Catalyst Project No. 2, again, we -- which is to increase water efficiency in East Honolulu, again, we identified measurable goals, which include maintaining East Honolulu's per capita water demand through 2040 at 170 gallons per person per day, and then a longer range goal to reduce per capita water demand to 130 per -- gallons per person per day by 2100.

So these actions that carry out this catalyst project are looked at a more districtive view from both increasing essentially water efficiency from the distributors as well as the water users. I can say with the exception of the action we've identified in the Koko Head Watershed, which is developing R1 recycled water for large irrigation users in Hawai‘i Kai.

So I wanted just to note that within the plan itself -- I know that was kind of a very quick overview of a lot of information, but within the plan itself, we want to make this as action-oriented as possible, and so we do include essentially a matrix that serves as an action plan and identifies the goals, champions, potential partners, the status, the costs, and target implementation for each of these actions identified as part of the two catalyst projects.

So lastly, I wanted to end on just a few updates.
