Approval of State of Hawai‘i, Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Aquatic Resources Application for a Well Construction Permit for Kalauhaʻihaʻi Restoration Well (Well No. 3-1643-002), TMK (1) 3-7-011:003 for Fishpond Restoration Use, Wai‘alae-East Ground Water Management Area, O‘ahu
I'd like to disclose that I and my grad student are working with Maunalua Fishpond Heritage Association and other UH and Chaminade faculty on the springs they’re stewarding. After reviewing the submittal I don't believe that my or my student’s relationships impact my ability to render an impartial decision on this application but I do want to be transparent in my relationship with MFHA, Chris, and some board members.
Thank you for that disclosure. We rarely ever have commission disclosure. With that being said, is there any objection to Commissioner Aurora for the participation in this agenda item?
The applicant right now is DAR so it's David Sakoda.
David, do you have any objections to Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani?
No objections.
Chris Cramer, do you and your group have any objections?
No, we don't.
With the full disclosure, Commissioner will continue to participate in this agenda item, but thank you for the disclosure.
Ryan Imata (CWRM Hydrologic Program Manager), Chris Cramer (President, Maunalua Fishpond Heritage Center) Staff stated the summary of request for Commission approval of a well construction permit to construct a well to restore water to the Kalauhaʻihaʻi Fishpond.
Aloha Chair Chang and Deputy Manuel and fellow Commissioners. On behalf of our board we just wanted to mahalo DLNR for their partnership in this project. This project is not just about the fishpond, it's about all of Maunalua Bay. We strongly believe that the return of the wai will help to bring back the health along with other community projects throughout Maunalua that'll bring back the health of the bay so that it'll bring back our natural resources and bring back our cultural practices. The practices of Aunty Laura and my tutu and all my aunties picking limu, my uncles fishing. Fortunately, I have cousins that still fish but we don't have the resources that we used to have but we hope that with projects like these our resources will become more plentiful and more of our current generation and our keiki will be able to practice richer experiences in our cultural practices in the future. That's what this project is about along with many other projects throughout our paeʻāina. We're very grateful for the support and we're very excited about what the future holds with a project like this and other projects throughout our paeʻāina. I know Jeannine is here if she'd like to say a few words as well.
Aloha kākou. I would just like to say that my father was a lawaiʻa from Miloliʻi and when he got married and settled down and raised a family in Niu, we had so much fish every day practically. We were Catholics so we always had fish, but I clearly remember going with him and swimming in the bay and I always told people the ʻeleʻele limu, the ʻeleʻele would tickle my stomach when I'd be swimming because if you know our bay, the water there is very shallow. As a little girl I never wanted to step in it, I always wanted to swim above it and it was so plentiful. It was everywhere and it is not like that now. As you saw the pictures we only have the ogo and it's not good and when I think of returning the water to the bay, I think it would make my father very happy. Thank you so much for all the work that you do and we're so hopeful that this will do it.
Thank you, Jeannine and I'm sure Aunty Laura is grateful for your perseverance.
Aloha Chair Chang, aloha Commissioners, my name is Kimi Makaiau. I’m a newer resident to East Honolulu, moved into the area about 10 years ago and my family home is now in Niu Valley a couple hundred yards above Kalauhaʻihaʻi. I grew up on the North Shore and Jeannine just triggered a memory of when we used to go down to the beaches in Hauʻula and gather limu manauea, limu ʻeleʻele, wawaeʻiole and it was my job to come home and help clean the limu because it was mixed in with limu kala and all kinds of other things. When we moved into Niu Valley it was important for me, I come from a fishing family and to have my son raised and understand our resources, particularly of our marine resources. One of the blessings for us through the pandemic was that we spent a lot of time as a family across the street right in front of Kalauhaʻihaʻi so my son at the age of five got his first heʻe in that water, but unfortunately the limu is not present. It's my hope that this water is restored is that in the area that my son is being raised that he might one day be able to share in those same practices that I grew up with. We appreciate all the work that everyone has been doing, this really is a community-driven effort with the support and perseverance of the State. I really hope that this project can serve as a model for other communities to really get their resources back. It's a start for us, mahalo.
I do want to provide context. Last week Friday the Land Board as the submittal said did approve DAR’s application to enter into a use and occupancy agreement with Department of Transportation so that the pipe can go underneath Kalanianaʻole Highway. When they were doing their highway widening they also condemned this parcel so the parcel was conveyed over to DLNR. DLNR does intend to enter into a longer-term lease with Maunalua Bay, the community organization to mālama this property. With Laura, Kaleo, myself and just our team really is looking to co-management to steward these resources. We could not have found better stewards than the ones that have been doing this for decades and who come from this area so that is our long-term goal here, but this is also a unique opportunity to try to restore this natural flow. We may have a similar situation in Lahaina, the restoration of Mokuhinia through a similar process as we're doing here, channeling that fresh water back into the areas that it used to flow in to restore that. We've got DAR, DAR is taking the lead because it is the restoration of a marine resource. Laura, first deputy's been helping to coordinate much of this but it is all of our different divisions working together, Engineering, CWRM, DAR, even OCCL and SHPD have played a role, but really the culmination of all of our divisions coming together with a community to steward this resource. It is something that I think all of us are extremely proud to be part of.
Chair, I just join you and I thank you for your statement and really commend the community for their leadership and their really hard efforts to do this. It's not just a matter of, oh it's a cool thing to support. You're really helping us do our job as I mentioned in the earlier item before the Commission. We have a job to really preserve the life of the land and the culture of our people and we can't do it here in an office, it has to be done out on the land by a community who associate and have pilina to that land. That's who we're seeing before us today and it's a privilege to be in partnership with you and we're very grateful for all that you're doing to help us fulfill this constitutional obligation.
I do have a question, I was wondering for staff, if we have the capacity or if the community groups or DAR has the capacity to track the progress of this effort. I don't know the time frame of it but to really be able to capture the before and after.
David, I mean that's one of the reasons why DAR is involved in this. Maybe you can explain the role of DAR?
Thank you, David Sakoda, DAR Fisheries program manager. DAR does have a number of estuary monitoring sites in Maunalua Bay and near Lucas Pond, Kalauhaʻihaʻi is one of them. We have baseline surveys and we plan to continue to monitor. We have cast net monitoring to look at the species assemblage and then we also have monitoring sites further out in the bay to track benthic cover and fish species and biomass. We will be monitoring and producing reports to understand how the bay is changing and I think this project will be a major part of whatever changes we might see.
Kaleo, CWRM is also going to be doing some monitoring on the well?
Usually there are meters put on wells when there's a pump in place but in this case there's no pump, we're looking at natural design. The design of this well is to recreate that horizontal flow so we're working with Engineering to figure out how to quantify, that’s to be determined. Once it gets put in we'll better understand if this actually works or not. Right now it's hypothetical, it's designed to work. We're hoping that it does but in the implementation we'll evaluate how to monitor that water use over time or what is flowing into the pond whether it's levels within the pond that we monitor at the end or within the actual well itself. If there's a way that we can install some monitoring equipment, working with Engineering so we're coordinating with them on the final design for monitoring. It's something we do want to figure out and track over time.
With BWS and Waste Management because they're showing us that water is still going into the sewer. With this pipe is there any change in that?
I just wanted to add to that conversation. I think the total flow is going to be dependent on the outflow into the ocean. Similar to the way that our Stream Protection and Management Branch looks at total flow, we could probably get gage heights or something in that outflow ditch to assess how much water is actually flowing because if it doesn't flow into the outflow ditch I don't think that there's going to be a consumptive use of water from the mauka to the makai side except for maybe a little bit of evaporation. It's going to be a significant quantity once we determine if it flows into the ocean via the outflow ditch from the fishpond so that's an area that I think we'd look at gauging the quantity of flow, thanks.
