Minutes  

planning, we update our plans on a regular basis, as well. We do have our own cascading diagram of our planning system but our Island Plans are due for an update. Our Hawai‘i Island Plan was adopted by our Commission in 2002 and we're currently going through that planning process to update it, including the new acquisitions that the Department is acquiring on that particular island. We'll go through a similar process for all of our islands, including the new acquisitions that the recent $600 million gift from the Legislature has allowed us to acquire new lands across the State.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** I would avoid using the word “gift” because it goes back to…

**ANDREW CHOY:** Obligation.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** …Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani's point and I think it would serve this Commission well to have a discussion of where that trust relationship comes from. I think we all have certain assumptions and certain knowledge, but there's a history here of obligation, not just it's nice or it's a concession to the host culture and so forth. There are obligations made. I appreciate, going back to the question of double dipping and so forth, the chair now has been really thoughtful by getting infill parcels like the one in Kailua that was just acquired and Waipoli on Kaua‘i and so forth near existing infrastructure. In that case, you don't double dip and have a reservation for that and then draw your resource from the county system, it's drawn from the county system and is not included in the reservation?

**ANDREW CHOY:** I think I'm going back to the point in Katie's presentation about what a reservation is. It's simply an acknowledgement that in certain aquifers or in certain surface water management areas, that the Department will require a certain amount of water. How that water gets conveyed to the DHHL lands, the reservation doesn't touch that. It just simply says that Water Commission acknowledges and reserves this water for the use of Hawaiian Home Lands. We still have to have conversations about how we get wet water to Hawaiian Home Lands, so that's often times in current practice done through conversations with Department of Water Supplies, through water development agreements in other far remote areas with private water system owners. It also should be noted we do own and operate four water systems, ours just being on Moloka‘i where we service about 400 customers and we also service customers off of Hawaiian Home Lands like the airport, the high school. We much rather prefer to work with county Department of Water Supplies to provide service to our areas. As through our own experience, owning and operating a water system is a very challenging task.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Not your core business.

**ANDREW CHOY:** Correct.
