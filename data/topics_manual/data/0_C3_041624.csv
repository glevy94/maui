Briefing on the FY24 Congressionally Directed Spending Funds Awarded to the Commission on Water Resource Management
Katie Roth, Planning Branch Chief
Staff provided an overview of Congressionally Directed Spending and the projects that will be funded by these awards which include sealing abandoned wells, Hawaiʻi Mesonet Network, water security audit and repairs, and deep monitor wells. Chair Chang not present.
The “we” is CWRM itself? The State of Hawaiʻi?
Yes, myself and Kaleo put together project proposals and then we talked with our Congressional delegation, their staff offices and basically put forward project ideas, funding proposals and submitted those.
How many wells does the $2.4 cover of the thousand? 
Of the wells, how much would it cost?
How many wells can you seal?
That’s a good question. Aback of the envelope estimate, it can be quite expensive, so my estimate would be maybe three or so based on what I’ve been told. I think it depends on the well site and what actually is needed to seal the well, but it can be quite expensive is what I’ve been told.
This earmarking request would go on every year then? 
No, this is a one-time thing.
No, but for this kind of project.
It could be, yes. It could be something that we petition for funding again.
While we’re asking questions, so DOH is also interested in it? I know that DOH also has funds that sometimes they can use. Could it be like a shared?
Yeah, I’ll talk about that in a few slides, but there is some matching requirements needed for this money. I’m in conversations with DOH right now to see if we might be able to take advantage of set aside money through Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) has also expressed interest in supporting this type of project so I’m talking to them as well.
Does it have to be public money match?
If we had a landowner or some developer of an asset, we could leverage their?
Yeah, I believe we could. I’d have to look at the EPA guidelines. 
It just can’t be government match, federal government.
I think it can’t be federal.
I have to look at the guidelines, but I don’t recall there being major restrictions on match. I’d have to consult the guidelines.
Do you have a distribution on the abandoned wells, where they are?
We do. I think we developed maps, too. I think we have visuals of where those would be. I know we have a spreadsheet that’s organized by island.
[inaudible] sugar and pineapple. 
Don’t we use just surface water? 
No way, if surface water is 200 feet deep.
Congratulations, good work.
Do I read these as these were our priorities?
They were, based on conversations with staff, referencing some of our plans like the Kauaʻi Water Plan.
So probably funding, right? Who has the money.
Yeah, depending on what federal agency, what they could fund. Exactly, but obviously we’ve had conversations today about the need for more monitoring and things like that so those could be future projects in the pipeline. Mahalo to our Congressional delegates.
It takes a while to get here and then are you already thinking about the next cycle and there must be a seasonal rhythm to it?
Yeah, right. I don’t believe we’ve been contacted, but I’d have to double check with the offices, but I know that they were kind of delayed this year in getting the federal budget finalized. We just found out pretty late in the game so I don’t know if that now stalls things for the next year.
It would be great to do more projects with DOH around wells in common.
The CDS money is it’s not restricted to state agencies. I know the County has applied and received funds, various county programs, I think even private entities can solicit for funding as well. My hope was just to kind of set a precedent internally for how we prioritize different projects even though we may not be the lead, we have a vested interest in seeing a lot of these projects happen to fulfill our mandates and public trust duties.
Do the projects have to be shovel ready? 
As long as you can encumber the funds.
