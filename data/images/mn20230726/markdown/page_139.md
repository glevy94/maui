So based on our analysis, we find that the low demand, the -- again, that one being the most probable, would result in an estimated 8.5 million gallons of water used per day, total water usage, and obvious -- again, the mid and high scenarios are unlikely that they would be proliferated, but we anticipate that in the mid scenario, there would be about 9.6 million gallons per day, and the high would be 11.96 million gallons per day.

In summary, based on our analysis of comparing the -- essentially, the water demand with the anticipated water supply in 2040, we have found that in the most probable scenario, there would be existing -- the existing water supply would be adequate, but in the high or mid or high demand scenarios, that this would require additional water resources or improved water efficiency. Similarly, in the ultimate demand scenario, even though it is obviously more difficult to project out water supply, it -- in -- at such a great time distance from 2100, we estimate that under the wet scenario, because of -- because of anticipated increased rainfall, there would be adequate water supply, and in the dry scenario that there would need to be improved water efficiency to meet the water demand.

So kind of all this is to say in terms of our key takeaways from this water analysis that both kind of under the
