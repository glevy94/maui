These green dots are the measurement sites. The orange line is the stream where it's losing, and then the transition from the Hawi volcanics to the Hualālai volcanics -- or Hamakua volcanics, sorry -- is where it moves from losing to gaining, so it actually gains stream flow in this region. And this unique geology -- we'd like to confirm that this stream flow is losing and the rate of loss, and then it's gaining at the rate of gain because it has implications for meeting the public trust needs of this stream.

Particularly, this region just below Lālāmilo Homesteads, this agricultural area has a historic ʻauwai system, multiple historic ʻauwai systems, and we have an informal complaint at this stage that there is insufficient water to meet the traditional practices of the agriculture in the area. This stream also runs through a number of parks and provides aesthetic and recreational value.

This stream was also identified in the USGS Water Resource Management Monitoring Needs Assessment published in 2020. Particularly, this seepage run right here, this blue line that's highlighted by USGS as a point that needs to be monitored, as understanding surface water-groundwater interactions in this region has implications for groundwater recharge as well.
