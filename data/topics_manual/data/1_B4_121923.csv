Modification of Existing Delegation to the Chairperson to Approve Well Construction and Pump Installation Permits and Other Groundwater Program Related Approvals by Limiting the Delegation to Certain Circumstances
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Ryan Imata, CWRM Hydrologic Program Manager Staff stated the summary request for the Commission to modify the existing authorization to the Chairperson to approve Well Construction and Pump Installation Permits and to continue pending application review and program-related approvals, statewide during the interim until a decision is made on Ka Paʻakai analysis requirements.
I do want to add some additional context to why this is coming before the Commission. Some of you have noticed I have a different style. I also have the unique opportunity to sit as a chair of the Board of Land and Natural Resources. Nothing is delegated to the division heads, everything is delegated to the chairperson if any at all, but in reading through I think all of us chairpersons bring different styles to the positions that we sit in. I come from a background of transparency, inclusivity. I think this body is a policy makers and I just want to make sure that this body provides us the guidance on what is delegated to the chairperson versus what needs to come back to the Commission. When I read through the previous delegation especially the 1997 delegation, that is over 15 years ago. Laws have changed, case laws, there have been numerous case laws and Ka Paʻakai is a relevant part in many cases, our analysis. When I look at the statute it also requires findings of facts and so I think that there are opportunities within the pump installation and construction where we can delegate but again I did not feel it appropriate for just me or Kaleo or CWRM to decide that. I really wanted guidance from the Water Commission as a matter of policy because as Ryan said majority of these are Hawaiian Paradise domestic single wells. I think that is appropriate for delegation, we don't want to hold anybody up but there are other… As resources become more limited there are matters that should be brought to the Commission. This really is the reason why it's coming is to get guidance from the Commission. I also have an issue with relying upon delegations that were made 25 years ago. I think that we should review these delegations on a regular basis. If things have changed then we should adjust, but that is the context upon which I had asked staff to review this. Commissioner Katayama at a previous meeting had also asked what's the criteria to determining what's delegated and not. Again that is the context, we're not trying to make more work for the water departments, we're not trying to create greater uncertainties but this is really an open forum to get guidance from the Water Commission helping us develop some criteria what is delegated to the chairperson versus what kinds of applications need to be reviewed by the Commission. That just provides some context.
Good afternoon Chair, Commissioners, and Deputy Director Manuel. My name is Marc Chun, I’m with the Board of Water Supply, Water Resources division. I’m here to represent the Board of Water Supply. First of all, thank you Chair as well as Ryan Imata for at least starting to address some of the things we have in here. That being said, I realize our testimony was just submitted, you guys got it this morning. So if you permit I'll just go ahead and read through the testimony.
Since I submitted at 11 o'clock last night I'd just like to read it into the record. It's very short, with your indulgence.
We did receive written testimony from Department of Water Supply County of Hawaii.
Aloha Commissioners, Jonathan Likeke Scheuer for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. The chair of the Hawaiian Homes Commission, director of the department submitted written testimony last month on the briefing on this matter. We noted there that the only notice in non-designated areas as a result of this 1997 designation is through the Water Resources bulletin published monthly. There's significant lacking information in the bulletin and what appears, what doesn't appear, how we have notice, and even if we receive effective notice, whether any comment have any ability to be considered. The functional result is that for DHHL one of the four protected public trust uses of water in our State, that this has denied DHHL practical due process. Orally I gave you some examples of the deficiencies in the bulletin from the November bulletin. These are repeated in the December bulletin so I'd just like highlight a couple for you. The Kula 1800 #1 well, a 450,000 gallon a day well for municipal use was approved on the day it was submitted. The Puʻunēnē First Assembly of God irrigation well was approved on February 13, 1990 and the application was accepted as complete on January 10th, 1990. For municipal scale wells in areas where DHHL has proposed development but not sufficient water, there's an obvious nexus between the impact on our ability to deliver homesteads. I want to expand a little bit or maybe reflect on some of the things the chair just touched on. Since 1997 when the last time the Commission chose to consider the delegation of authority we've had the Waiāhole 1 case, the Waiāhole 2 case, the Waiāhole 3 case, the Waiola case, the Kukui case, the Nā Wai ʻEhā case, the Kauaʻi Springs case, Ka Paʻakai o Ka ʻĀina, all of which have contained very specific guidance to State agencies particularly but not only the Water Commission on your duties under the public trust, what public trust resources should be protected. As said on the first of those cases Waiāhole, in all areas without exception or distinction so they didn't say, oh you've got to protect it more in designated areas versus undesignated areas. The consequences of this delegation since 1997 has been there's been no meaningful opportunity for public trust interests or other members of the public to comment, no ability for competing rights holders to even have a hearing on matters, no ability to have a contested case, no analysis on impacts to public trust uses by the applicant or the agency. Just to be really clear a five-day pump test might be able to capture your impact on the nearby well, it's not going to capture any impacts on far away public trust resources and even when you do, within your records for a permit under a delegated authority when a pump was switched in the night Waineʻe A skimming well which is directly mauka of Mokuʻula, a five-day pump test was done, water levels immediately dropped next door to where Mokuhinia was and yet the consultant said, oh well I think there's other reasons why these are dropped. Even with the five-day pump test being long enough, the data was sort of portrayed in a particular way and of course because this was done administratively there's no opportunity for anybody who might be concerned about the restoration of Mokuhinia to have any role, any ability to comment on it. The short hand that I explained to folks around Hawaiʻi is that functionally because of the delegation policy it's as if the water code exists only in delegated areas. For the most part surface water a little bit more but for groundwater it's like we're still in the plantation era if you are not lucky enough to live in a designated Water Management Area. If you to try and defend or comment on a public trust use that might be impacted by groundwater development just does not exist so recognize having heard the comments from particularly Honolulu Board of Water Supply, there are some concerns about duplicability of having a well construction permit before pump installation permit. Those comments are well taken. Mainly what DHHL would look for is that we have these rights. A difficulty getting water to our lands, this process harms us and our beneficiaries. So to the degree people are asking for deferral or denial of what you're proposing, let's make sure we work together on how the opposition actually addresses these fundamental constitutional issues which thankfully the chair's proposed action is addressing.
Let me get this straight, you’re supporting the…
The department is on record supporting moving forward with some version of the recommendation. If you defer, we would consider ourselves to be an essential stakeholder in the discussions.
You're not saying that this is rule making.
I am not saying that this is rule making. If the contention that this is a rule making procedure is true then one could fairly ask under what authority this has been done for the last quarter century which would expose a whole bunch of other things including existing people with well construction pump installation permits to questions on whether or not their permits were lawfully approved.
I've got a question for Ryan and I agree that there should be a committee from this group. I think the more robust informative questions that you can ask those people who are applying, the applicants for these permits the better. In fact you have a more varied committee to actually decide whether to begin with the get-go whether these people, these applicants are actually who they say they are or if they're just coming in from another state or a foreign country under an assumed name. Whether they're here just to take the resources from our children and grandchildren because the Lord gave us this land for our children and grandchildren. That's basically what it is, not to be ripped off and taken by other people and at the moment that's what we see as a community in Kahuku and we're very concerned about it. Therefore your idea of the modification in the process really of giving out these applications of permits I think is a good one and it should be decided positively upon by another committee that you want to install. Thank you.
This is a question for Ryan. I came in on the tail-end of Ota Well discussions but I what do recall hearing was that in non-designated areas part of the issue is that the cost of maybe utilities or the cost of drilling a well is very high so that waiting until the discussion of pump installation comes up sort of tilts the decision-making space in ways that can make it hard for the Commission to manage water in non-designated areas or deny a permit for instance, to deny a pump installation permit after a well has been constructed. Did I get that superficially correct? That was one of the arguments I recall hearing.
I will tell you that in 1997 we bifurcated well construction and pump installation permits and for that very reason that waiting for the pump installation permits was problematic. It was a consultant named Steve Bowles who's not with us anymore but he was advocating for the Commission to issue concurrent well construction and pump installation permits. One thing that maybe isn't obvious and I should have done better in making clear to the Commission is that when we issue a pump installation permit, it might be for a certain capacity pump but that doesn't mean that staff or the Commission or the chair or whoever has the authority is initially sanctioning that pump capacity. In fact in the delegation of authority to the chair to approve both the well completion report acknowledgement and the certificate of pump installation completion, that's dependent on a couple of things. First of all, compliance with our pump test requirements and then second, our assessment that that pump test analysis shows no adverse impacts to the environment. One thing, that I wanted to address something that Jonathan said about duration of pump tests. That definitely is a concern of ours and oftentimes what we do is if we do think that a longer study period is needed, one example is in Kohanaiki is that we require a long-term monitoring plan to look at water levels adjacent to the pumping station to see what long-term trends look like. The Commission does reserve the right to reduce the pumping at that pumping station over the long-term. We always have that ability so I think that we've developed a process that has been pretty efficient in terms of initially allowing somebody to put a pump in. We tell them you can put the pump in but if we don't sanction that pump size they have to take it out and put in a pump that doesn't have adverse environmental impacts during the permit approval process. We also reserve that right in the long-term. I think we have the authority to tell anybody that they can or they have to remove a pump and put in a smaller capacity if we start to see impacts to the environment at a later date. I know it's harder, there's some reliance on what pump is in the well but the Commission's authority is to protect groundwater resources. I hope that answers your question.
When you say “we,” in the past has that been in front of the full Commission or has that been discretionary within staff?
Again, the delegation to the chair was to approve well and pump permits and to also approve the well completion report and the certificates of completion. It falls within staff's purview. What would happen is if the Commission was recommending that somebody have to downsize their pump and they object to it, we'd bring it to the Commission for full approval. I think the things that we are proposing and in the past have been approving ministerially have been things where we see no environmental impacts and there are no objections from the applicant but where we see that there are those kinds of almost discretionary issues that we need to be resolved, staff doesn't want to have that discretionary ability and we present it to the Commission for approval.
For Department of Water Supply both Hawaii Island and Honolulu, you speak to the large issue but I'm trying to reconcile, calibrate your testimony with specific recommendations. With respect to each of these recommendations the individual domestic well construction, a lot of which are in Pāhoa, you oppose that or you're in favor of that? (BWS responds in the affirmative) Okay, you're okay with that. With number two, the individual domestic pump installation [inaudible] that are not designated, do you have a position on that?
Why don’t you come up to the table.
Because it seemed like there's a lot more work to be done and the reason to have meetings but I couldn't discern whether you're okay with what's going on here, specifically what we’re recommending.
I'm Nancy Matsumoto. I'm chief hydrologist-geologist at Board of Water Supply, Honolulu Board of Water Supply and I work for Marc in the Water Resources Division.
For instance with recommendation one, you're okay with that? Individual domestic well construction, well modification permits for wells for systems that are not in designated management areas.
Speak up a bit, I don't think Ryan can hear you.
Where estimated water usage as the date of the application is less than 70% sustainable yield, etc.
Our comments are just limited to the potable system that we operate so we're not really commenting one way or another on 1 or 2.
On 1 or 2 and 3.
3 is where we asked the question of the clarification of the definitions.
How about 4?
We didn't have a comment on that one.
If we supply the clarification on item 3 then you're okay with the submittal? With the caveat you think the discussion needs to happen regarding the issue.
Our fourth comment yes, but also within our second comment we talked about that we didn't really have the comment on coming before the Commission for the pump installation permits but our comment was we think that the delegation to the chair could still exist for the well construction permit. That was the difference there.
It's not specifically tied to these recommendations, sort of a side comment.
Which is my problem. This is what we have before us so you raised issues that are interesting but we're trying to deal with what we have before us. What I'm hearing, there's no real fundamental issue with what we have before us.
I'll try to help you guys and I'll try also to help ourselves here through this process. The Board has its own process in which it develops its own sources on Oʻahu and is unique. They operate within a water management area so they know that a water use permit is something that has to come before this body. What I'm hearing is that there's no opposition of coming before the Commission, there's going to be multiple bites of the apple including the pump installation permit and the water use permit; however, the way that the Board applies for permits is really unique and different than other applicants throughout the State. The board applies for a well construction permit in order to construct the well, test it, and determine its productivity. Based on that productivity they apply for a pump installation permit, water use permit at a later phase. There's no problem what I'm hearing from the Board to come back to this Commission. What they want to expedite and tighten the time process for them is to be able to develop the well, that that continue to remain administratively delegated to the chair to approve while the pump and the water use permit still come back to the Commission. Is that accurate?
That position is not in..
It's not. Right now, the well construction permit would come to you folks for approval. this is how the Board uniquely applies for water use permits within this Commission. The context that Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani brought up for the Ota Well, they tried to do something similar and bifurcate. In that conversation because it came before the Commission, there was this detrimental reliance conversation that if somebody sinks a well for example, even the Board in this case that they've invested $1 million or $2 million into a hole and then if a permit comes before this body for a pump or water use permit and we deny it, it's like, shouldn't we have approved it holistically from well through pump through allocation? You're investing a lot of money at the front end and it puts this body in an awkward position to say, okay we did we invest $5 million or whatever you invest in the hole but we're not going to issue the pump permit. This is the dynamic that's at play right now within this submittal. Ryan is raising his hand. We could entertain amendments to this recommended decision, it could be specific to the Board's concerns in order to help support the Board in looking at source development. It could be specific for the well construction permit. I'd also highlight that where wells are developed also has potential impacts on Ka Paʻakai. Ka Paʻakai is not only pump related, it's actually the site of the well, the well source itself. It’s a complexity and layers of decision- making and review. I think aligning with Chair's recommendation is to have this conversation in public formats and sessions and not purely between staff and the Deputy. At this point in time that's what we're talking about today. I just trying to get you guys in alignment with what I think we're recommending. I'm hearing that you guys aren't represented within the recommended actions right now but this is part of the conversation if there's some something that needs to be discussed.
BWS’ unique situation, is that provided for in our Administrative Rules?
No, Administrative Rules, they're supposed to be applicable across the board no matter what, it's not specific carve outs unless we make it explicit in that rule making process but I don't think that's the intent of Administrative Rules.
The question is, the complexities of this issue, can they be handled with a forum we’re in right now to add address their issue or do you need more time to really think about this and bring it forward?
I agree with you and I'm going to have to leave, sorry, but I'd like the Commission to think about whether we want to defer this matter in light of the late testimony and this discussion, whether we have enough information to make an informed decision. The second thing I wanted to ask is if we delegate and this is maybe a legal question, if we delegate to the chair is the chair able then to delegate to the deputy without a rule amendment? Is it the chair and her designee or his designee to make decisions? I don’t know, I haven't looked at the rules. I don't know if that's an issue but that came to mind as I was listening to this discussion.
That's part of the reason I raised that.
Kathy, you’re of the opinion we shouldn't move on the four? There seems to be no dissent about this, it's just do we want to take up a fifth thing or do we want to bring that back in a separate context?
I leave it to you guys, there's a lot of discussion and I'm just not sure. I read through the submittal and then I got the late thing and I was a little confused about how it, but we have a quorum so you guys may be able to make a decision.
I'm sure there'll be more discussion.
I'm a little confused about the differences between ‘97 and now. We've gotten through so much detail, it's been delegated to you before and this thing says we're going to delegate to you again, right?
I think it's different but I wanted to bring this delegation authority back to the Commission. The times have changed, we've got new case law, we've got a new Ka Paʻakai Analysis that to utilize the same delegation that we did in 1997 without really…Those don't come to me for approval, those are approved by the deputy director not by the chairperson.
From what I understand, the ‘97 was a delegation to you. It just happened that it got then delegated to him, right? I don’t understand. I don't really see a big difference between ‘97 delegation and now. I think more or less now you want clarification not really a fundamental change in how things are.
I'm not sure, that's why I'm asking the Commission because I think there are questions related. Jonathan raises the questions about due process, most of the delegation is not conducted in open Commission meetings, that's handled by the staff. Many of these permits that are delegated don’t come before an open forum for public participation. That's the way the delegation has functioned and I would tell you I do have some concerns about that under Ka Paʻakai, under the new case law, under the Supreme Court's direction to us. We have to make findings of facts and in a delegation there is none of that.
As I said I disagree on whether we need a full Ka Paʻakai Analysis on each and every decision we make and I don't think that Supreme Court decision requires that but that's a discussion for another time. From what I understand, I think you've addressed the concern about Honolulu Board of Water Supply, but now I’m totally confused about… Commissioner Ho leaves the meeting.
I can address Dr. Miike’s question about the difference between the initial delegation and what we're recommending today. I guess it's not really obvious and maybe that's my fault for not being super clear about the significant change in this. If you look at recommendations 1 and 2, those are for individual domestic wells and pumps and again this is in an effort to make sure that staff is not having discretion about things where there may be potential objections to. I'm not sure that the public has objections necessarily to individual domestic wells where the pump capacity is relatively small, rather we have applications in Hawaiian Paradise Park for water bottling or we have applications for uses that I'm not sure that we can apply reasonable and beneficial analyses to assess. I think that's the most significant difference between the previous delegation and today is individual domestic delegation whereas we take agricultural stuff and industrial stuff and everything else that's not individual domestic to the Commission. To address the Board's concerns, most of the Board's applications come to the Commission anyway because they are associated with water use permits. What they are asking is to look at just delegating approval for well construction because again the Commission is going to have that second bite at the apple regarding the pump installation and water use permit. I understand where that's coming from, at the same time I know that Jonathan has raised concerns about Hāpuna and that's just a monitor well. There's no pump being put into there but Jonathan did raise concerns at the first MOA presentation regarding breaching into a deep confined lens. I can see his point about wanting to have the ability to comment on even wells that aren't for production purposes. There's a lot of useful discussion here and a lot of, I don't want to say competing interest but a lot of different viewpoints that we need to take into perspective and understand. I'm certainly listening to the discussion and trying to see how best we can fold it into our recommendation at this time. I would say that to address the Board's concerns, maybe in item #3, we talk about well construction permits for exploratory purposes and amend the recommendation to say that.
Since Jonathan represents a department, another state agent, I'm going to let him come up but go-ahead Marc.
I just wanted to clarify, Commissioner Hannahs. I apologize, I misunderstood the question. As we looked back through it, item 1 and 2, overall it says get rid of the delegation except for a few cases. Our comment is because we would fall into the other ones.
It's that last statement, all other permits and program approval is not explicitly delegated. That's where we…
That's your concern, right?
That’s a big one.
It’s in bold, even.
So that’s actually and I apologize.
1-4 we don’t, but it’s that last.
It’s the limitation of the delegation which used to be blanket. Now, it's constrained and I can see Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply and the bigger utilities who would be subject to that change are the ones who are raising concerns.
Three things in response to the conversation. In response to Commissioner Miike's questions, the actual practice has been that everything if it's not in a water management area, everything's been designated: small domestic wells, large municipal wells.
Designated or delegated?
Delegated, thank you. It sometimes appears in the bulletin, occasionally they don't appear in the bulletin. There's been no public process, it's all happening at the staff level so the difference in what's proposed here versus the practice is that it's saying we're going to still delegate a whole bunch, a vast majority of permits which are small domestic wells but there are certain things we're not automatically delegating. That's the difference, that's what the proposal is. I think that the concerns from the Honolulu Board of Water Supply could possibly be addressed by an addition. The way the proposed action reads is everything is not delegated except for these four things and so five, municipal well construction permits in designated water management areas, that would be a fifth thing that is delegated to the chair for approval.
Is that acceptable to BWS?
I can’t speak for the Board of Water Supply, but I follow the logic and I’ll take it back to our boss.
The last thing and this gets to the point Ryan said. I will note that the recommendation does not specifically address wells that seek to explore or develop deep confined groundwater which I think do give rise to some fairly significant concerns and might deserve a specific call out that those are not delegated for approval. Right the problems that have been had at the Keōpū well and the Kaloko deep monitor well where they have breached the deep confined groundwater and in Keōpū. I think it took 17 years to seal it, Kaloko, it's still not sealed. Under the submittal, the staff is still delegated authority.
If we add your point 5 which Board says it addresses their and leave the, all other permits and program approvals, then we're okay on that issue.
I actually read it slightly differently. I read that this would delegate authority for an exploratory well into the deep confined groundwater under item 3.
You would want that withdrawn?
It would be something like, item 3 as worded comma after test holes except for Wells into deep confined groundwater comma and for the sealing of unused and abandoned wells.
I have language if you guys are open to suggested proposals, but before we get into…
Can we just go back to Bobby Command and Hawaiʻi Island.
If I may, again to frame, chair has given me direction, I've been working with staff to get direction, we have permits coming in the door every day, every week. What we're trying to do is find a good balance between Chair's desire to be transparent and provide a space for this body to give us more guidance on policy as well as keep the engine running and operating. What I will advocate for is that this body act on the four items presented. Related to the Board and Departments of Water Supply maybe additional delegations that we have follow-up conversations with them about their specific situations and come back to this Commission with a more thought-out process and refined delegation. If that is something we want to recommend for consideration at a later time but I think what we as staff are advocating for is some kind of approval from this Commission or amended delegation so that Chair also feels comfortable signing because it is her decision to make. There's a lot of caveats here that she can always bring it back to the Commission as recommended in this space. My first recommendation is that this body take action on the four and we come back. We'll work on language. I’ll present some recommended language to address the testimony received today and then specific to the department and Board's unique, County municipal water system processes, we can work on maybe recommending a separate delegation that's more thought out.
Including the County of Hawaiʻi?
May I ask a question to the staff and Chair? We vote on issues to delegate authority on many issues. Would it be too onerous to say we have a stack of permit applications and just go through so it's not guesswork, what is and what isn't delegated. Could that decision of what gets delegated come before the Commission in a shorter?
On specific permit by permit?
Is that a submittal? I guess that's a lot of work, right?
What we're asking for as this policymaking body are your heartburn issues. Areas that you want and believe community or the public should get to weigh in on where rights are impacted. You are the discretionary decision-making body, you get to guide us in what we can and cannot or what we should be bringing back to this body for decision making. I think what we're recommending is right here before you based on the dialogue to date and Chair's direction. We can come back in 60 to 90 days, maybe right after legislature because we're going to be busy come January through April. Right after legislature it'll give us time to work with the Counties on their unique situations on what permits and also with Chair, what she feels comfortable because it is a delegation to the chair at the end of the day. She could bring everything back to this body but what this group between the Department of Water Supply and the chair as well as staff feel comfortable recommending to this body. If it is no further action and this is the limit of the delegation then so be it, but we can have those conversations between now and let's say April or May for a time frame and then be specific to the recommended modifications, item 3, and Jonathan's testimony and so forth. If I can I'll just share screen of a potential modification to item 3 or if you want to take Commissioner Katayama first.
Ryan, based on the four recommendations before us, how does it affect the permit processing handling time? Does it make it shorter, longer or is it no change?
Based on the four recommendations we’re essentially keeping things the way that they are but are going to present non-individual domestic applications to the Commission. That's really hard to say. I would say that it does increase staff's workload fairly significantly to have to write submittals for those applications that don't comply with these conditions which would slow down the overall process for all applications.
For the record going back to Dr. Miike’s question, can you summarize the differences between 1997 and the four recommendations you're making before us today? What are the differences?
I think the primary difference is that number 1 and 2 are really constraining the delegation to individual domestic wells so you may have some wells that are not individual domestic. Say for example as we've been discussing municipal wells and those would all come to the Commission until such time as we work out some kind of language and present it to the Commission to make some of those delegated. That's in essence the biggest difference. Again, maybe the bigger difference is going to come when we have an assessment of Ka Paʻakai and the applicability of Ka Paʻakai. That's where we're going to see differences in our ability to process things. One thing that I also haven't articulated in this entire thing is that most of the wells that are not within these delegations are actually still coming to you guys for approvals. I don't present a lot to you but where in water management areas unless there are these exploratory wells by the Board, I am bringing the applications to the Commission for approval and then there have been applications in other instances where we do bring it to you guys for approval. There's not a super significant change in the amount of work and the way that things are being processed but I think that this does two things. It specifically talks about individual domestic wells and really defining that as the delegation and then as a result it's just going to bring these water bottling wells or agricultural wells in non-management areas to you. I'm not going to say you're going to get ten a month but I think this delegation strikes a really good balance in allowing the Commission to have the ability to comment on things where there are issues related to reasonable and beneficial uses but not overburden the Commission with looking at every individual well in Hawaiian Paradise Park. That's why I cited those statistics because I don't think you guys want to see 15-gallon per minute pump permits where the sustainable yield is 350 MGD and they're not even pumping 1 MGD. This strikes a pretty good balance and I think that we do need to have discussion with the stakeholders as has been pointed out today about further enhancing which permits we want delegated and which permits we still wanted to take to the Commission. I hope that answers your question.
Wayne, I'm reading the 1997 delegation, the commission delegate the following Authority. The chair is authorized to approve well construction and well modification permit applications Statewide unless the chairperson determines the matter should be decided by the Commission. To me that's a blanket delegation and that's what I'm uncomfortable with. I agree with what Ryan is saying that these recommendations are designed to address the overwhelming domestic wells. We're not trying to slow those down and we're not trying to bog down staff on that but it really clarifies what has minimal impact. Unless a domestic well is right in the middle of a trail or the water is running into the ocean those really don't have any impact even on Ka Paʻakai. In my mind these recommendations are more tailored to our current situation and reflects the case load so I feel more comfortable with this than what we were relying on the 1997.
Frankly, Ryan I think you've done a good job on this everybody's had a lot of very constructive comments. There has been lots of good discussion on this issue. I feel personally this is reasonably and a relatively efficient approach or system for reviewing and processing these permits and I think there are adequate protections in place to prevent any wrongful or inappropriate approvals. One approach which I'd like to see this approved…
I just want to get a better comfort level on that this is not impacting adversely the municipal water development efforts because they impact the larger community. If I understand that you know the larger wells or municipal wells have a greater impact on our water resources; however, do we want to impede or make their processes longer and more expensive and I think after hearing today's testimony I would feel much better if we could strike a better balance and comprehend some of their concerns.
I think this is a reasonable approach and it’s relatively efficient and it's a pretty good system for reviewing and processing these permits. There are adequate protections in place. If I could suggest that we approve this today and ask Ryan to come back to us in a year to report on what problems have become evident and at that time folks can provide additional testimony for mistakes or inappropriate things happening and at that point the approval process could be modified. In other words, move ahead at this point with the well- considered system that has largely been in place with some additional protections going forward and then review it in a year, I think is a reasonable approach.
I feel like we're ready to look at the language now if you're going to insert any additional language in the recommendation.
Can I ask for some better articulation around that bifurcation of process with designated and non-designated areas. It's in text but it's not clear to me and maybe it's also not clear to others how that process differs and at what point Ka Paʻakai becomes part of the conversation. For designated areas it's in the water use permit process so it's already addressed. Where it isn't addressed is in undesignated areas. Not to lengthen things but to frontend potential conflict it might be good for the Commission to clarify and work out for ourselves when and where that happens. That's my sense right now.
I'm just trying to understand the question. I think you're talking about the bifurcation or the difference between designated and non-designated areas in where Ka Paʻakai applies, right? On the issue of Ka Paʻakai, I don't think we've made any kind of conclusive decision about Ka Paʻakai analyses as they apply to individual well construction and pump installation permits. Right or wrong this is my assessment is it is important to understand that back in ‘97 when we adopted the standards they were really designed to show de minimis impact. I'm not going to say what my opinions are but they were really designed to make sure that there are protections in place. I think Ka Paʻakai issues are minimalized or impacts to the environment are minimalized when someone complies with the well standards.
Let me back up, what I meant is there is a different workflow if you are in a designated or non-designated area and maybe the applicants know that but I'm looking at the permit application and it doesn't necessarily show that workflow. What you articulated verbally today I did not capture on the submittal.
Yeah because that's not what we're asking for. Yes, I hear what you're saying, to contextualize within the larger code and that process, we didn't talk about designation process, we didn't talk about water use permits. This is purely with relation to the delegation to the chairperson for well construction, pump installation permits and all of the other well certificates and other approvals that have been delegated in a management area. The only additional thing required is a water use permit, that has its own body, breath, process, all of that analysis outside of a management area. If you want to dig a well you get a well construction and pump installation permit. Right now that's completely delegated to the chair to approve and via practice the deputy has been approving that with staff. This basically dusts off that delegation and says, renewed in 2023 this is the limit of the delegation: individual domestic wells which make up over half of our permit applications, everything else is coming back to this Commission and this body. To make it very simple, individual domestic wells are delegated to the chair to sign, chair will sign that, everything else comes back to this body.
But that's really only 1 and 2 referenced.
1 and 2, #3 is a regurgitation of the existing delegation with the first delegation back in, monitoring wells, abandonments, basically things to protect the aquafer is delegated to the chairperson to review and we want to continue that but with recommended language and modifications. If I can share my screen specific to that?
Before you do that can I add one thing? Aurora, I don’t think you’ll see a lot of differences in the process with respect to designated and non-designated areas. One of the biggest differences you're going to see is in the way that the Departments of Water Supply apply for permits versus the way that private users apply for permits because Board of Water Supply can invest the capital in drilling an exploratory well and then not develop it. I'm sure they want some assurances that they'd be able to develop that and get a water use permit but private land owners always apply, especially out in Wailua, Mokuleʻia where we are bringing the applications to you, Kahuku, we're bringing the applications to you guys for approval. You'll see the well pump and water use permits all come to you at the same time. The difference is not so much in management areas, non-management areas, it's in the big municipalities versus the private systems. That's where you're going to see the biggest difference in the process.
I agree that based on the applications that come before this.
Ryan, with respect to workload as I understand it why this became such an issue with staff is the submittals that you guys prepare you would have to do one of those for every single one of these Hawaiian Paradise applications, right? This delegation says those are continued to be delegated because those have de minimis impact. They are for domestic use and the water that they're using is so minuscule in comparison to some of the other well construction permits that we're doing. That's really what this is addressing because otherwise in the absence of that delegation you will have to prepare a staff submittal for every single one of those and that could delay that domestic user from installing and may even increase their costs.
Cindy, we've discussed this in the past or we've discussed this with the AG's office in the past is the applicability of Chapter 343 I thought was applicable towards discretionary permits and not ministerial permits. That's a whole other ball of wax if things become discretionary then there may be applicability of 343 and 343 might need to be done for all well permits, too.
I think there's still exemptions, but Kaleo did you want to show us?
To get us closer towards some action within the early afternoon hours if possible. The only thing I'm recommending to amend, everything remains the same except for 3. We're just going to be a little bit more specific. This is getting to the Board's testimony to be very explicit so it's well construction permits for monitoring, sampling, and observation wells and test holes not including any injection wells under the authority of the Department of Health, soil borings for geological investigation for structural foundation design, and monitoring wells into deep confined aquifer…something like that is addressing all of the testimony specific to the delegation. Those would come back to the Commission or are not applicable is what the Board is wanting clarification on.
Deep injection wells that BWS talked about where this clarified, that's a DOH, that doesn’t come to us. Then Jonathan's concerns, deep confined aquifer does that address your concern?
I would not include the word ‘monitoring,’ I would just say ‘and wells’ into the deep confined aquifer which again wouldn't mean that people can't go into it but it comes before this board.
The default is everything comes before this board unless the chairperson chooses delegation.
Wording thing, do you want to clarify that these things don't even fall, two of them don't fall within the purview?
I was trying to figure it out but I think within the record of this conversation it would be sufficient unless you want to clarify that it’s not applicable?
No, I trust you folks.
Marc did you want to add anything to that?
If I heard correctly, first appreciate Deputy Manuel for his offer to continue to discuss this in condition of a #5. If you approve it as is right now then the Board of Water, other municipal wells would still fall under the, have to come to the Commission for well construction permits. We're still actually in the same spot, with that regard our testimony still stands. We don't agree with that part. There's an undefined amount of time as much as we will try to work together that we will be caught in that situation.
I don't know how to address that because on one hand the balance is I don't think our intention is to create a longer delay or more work, member Katayama's concerns about not wanting to cause delays for municipal providers. Kaleo, can you think of anything to address that?
If there's a time commitment we could move to approve as amended with an additional requirement to come back to this body in 60 days or 90 days. I'm just trying to manage expectations once the legislature starts it's an all hands on deck issue and then consulting beyond just the Board and Hawaii County then we'd want to work through that. I also don't know if there's any specific permits, I'd have to check with Ryan what we've already received or if there's going to be submissions coming from the Board for any specific wells.
Does that satisfy?
I’ll go by the first statement that I’m not manager in chief of the Board of Water Supply [inaudible].
Well now that it's absolutely clear, can I recommend they accept the staff recommendation with amendments?
Second. You're going to go back and work with them on their issues?
Yeah and we can work through it. I don't think it's addressing their concern and this is where I need to check on what's in the pipe or what permits do we have like what construction permits do we have to act on or process that would fall in this category? I don't know if that's one or two or 20. If we can get clarity on that and what we could do is also just expedite it and bring it to this Commission to approve within that time frame. We don't even have to wait, we could just bring it to Commission as a submittal and again it's Chair, everything is delegated to you right now. It's really what the Chair feels comfortable signing or bringing to this Commission. This is the guidance that has been given.
Your interest is time, not process? If the process is it comes to us you just want to make sure it happens in a timely way.
You don't have any objections to 1 and 2?
Or 3 and 4.
Because 1 and 2 only applies to individual domestic pumps.
In that case it's the overall delegation removed, that's where we’re impacted, that’s where our comments are coming from. 1 and 2 is just allowing Chair to go ahead and have [inaudible] so it's not quite the same question [inaudible].
1-4 is okay, it’s when we say all other we capture them and we put them into something that needs to come to us.
Even if you take that out they still are captured. The reason we put that there was just to make it very clear that this is the limit of what the Commission is approving. We try to think through all of the things that currently come before me or Chair to sign, but if for whatever reason we didn't catch something in this submittal which I'm pretty sure we got everything, that is just a catch-all. This body is the final decision maker, not staff which is what we heard is a concern. That's the point of that bold statement at the end whether that statement's there or not… If it's not there then one could assume that the 1997 delegation stays intact and it adds these additional delegations which would make this decision pointless.
But your commitment is to work with them.
And Ryan as well, not just me but we're trying to work through these processes also with Chair. As Chair mentioned the impetus and refocus of this is to dust off delegations to make it clear and have her as the leader of our agency feel comfortable with guidance from this body.
I’d just like the sunshine to come in but I also don't want to be the basis upon which we're holding up the process either so there's got to be some nice compromise here. People have an opportunity to comment, at the same time we're facilitating the process. Bobby Command, you're still on board Hawaiʻi County and their Department of Water Supply, have we addressed their concerns?
I am not an employee of the Department of Water Supply so I can't make any statements for them, the only thing I would say is that this is a very spirited and interesting discussion. I don't claim to be a water expert by any means but Water Supply is not here and I think they deserve to have a little bit of say in that or at least get their comments in. I know they provided testimony but it wouldn't hurt to defer and speak to them first.
I'll say having read their testimony they didn't speak against any of these issues, any of the four things we’re approving. They just had other issues.
I think they were concerned with Ka Paʻakai.
Ka Paʻakai.
Again, we agreed we need to resolve.
That is still being addressed by staff and the AG's office.
The Ka Paʻakai in this context we're not addressing that. That issue at this point in time we need more time with counsel to determine whether it's on every single application, when it comes in, when is it applicable. We're just talking about the delegation to Chair to approve permits and that process is now being modified to be more explicit, That's the extent of it.
Which helps a lot of Hawaiʻi Island constituents.
The Puna side, definitely. Hearing the conversation a lot of the concerns are tied to our municipal water systems and hearing the testimony from Department and Board similar to what Ryan was saying, there are a lot of private developers that develop wells and then dedicate them on Big Island, for example or Maui to the Boards or Departments of Water. That could come before this body for decision making.
Maybe having an opportunity Kaleo, you and your staff convening a meeting with all of the Board of Water Supplies to address this. I think that would be helpful before we come back, before you guys come back. Between now and throughout leg. we can work through that process and if there are any specific permits that are ready for approval, we can bring those. Chair, if you don't want to sign we can bring this to the body in February, March, April, whenever.
Bobby, did you hear that? You tell Keith Okamoto if he's got any permits that he wants to have heard before us, bring it to us.
I will do that, thank you.
We are open to having those processed in a timely fashion.
