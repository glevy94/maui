regulatory framework. A little bit on the Hawai‘i Water Plan, you're familiar with the four components that the county water use and development plan has to account for, include the state findings of the other state plans. You know, just the name of the county water use and development plan per se is somewhat limiting, although it's broader, but in the tight, it's basically a plan for water use and development, basically how much -- where's the water, how much do you need, and how are you gonna get it there? And so it should incorporate management of water and conservation and protection and restoration. And so the council back in 1990 either renamed it or named it the O‘ahu Water Management Plan, and this is the framework.

A little bit of the statewide framework of 2000, there is a Section 3-26 that allows for flexibility, for innovation to accommodate unique and county-specific concerns tailored to each county, and so that's why we broke it up into eight regional plans. In July of 2022, there was a presentation on some of the updates that could be made to the statewide framework. Those gaps were climate uncertainty, applying indigenous knowledge, ag water, plan utility, and integrating land use and water policies and agencies into the plan. And by breaking it up into these regional watershed management plans, we feel that we've addressed a large part of that.
