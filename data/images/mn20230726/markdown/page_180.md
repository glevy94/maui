Commissioners, any questions? Oh, go ahead, Aurora.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** I have one. This is for Ayron because USGS is not here today. How does it -- do we have good data even in undesignated areas or --

**DR. STRAUCH:** Yes.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** Oh.

**DR. STRAUCH:** So from -- you know, I won't speak for groundwater, although I do know that they have done a lot of outreach statewide to get small groundwater wells to report, even though I believe domestic wells aren't required to report.

Is that accurate?

**DEPUTY MANUEL:** Right now, that's not the focus and priority (inaudible).

**DR. STRAUCH:** Yeah, the focus is on the larger users.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** Okay.

**DR. STRAUCH:** And we have pretty good reporting from all the larger users. On the surface water side, certain users, we've been getting consistent data for, like East Maui Irrigation or Wailuku Water, because they -- that information has been tied to contested cases. Other systems, it's been much more recent. Like Department of Agriculture systems are -- on the Big Island or the Molokai irrigation system, they -- they were not monitoring their delivery system.
