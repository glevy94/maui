PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Deputy Directory Dean Uyeno
Staff stated the summary of request which is to approve SCAP.6002.2, ditch diversion modifications, and installation of monitoring stations as pertaining to the Waimea Watershed Agreement.
Good morning, Chair, Commissioners. We submitted a written testimony and I think we’ll stand on that testimony, but here to answer any questions.
Can you identify your organization?
I’m sorry, with the Kekaha Agriculture Association (KAA).
Hi, good morning, Chair Chang, and Commissioners. For the record my name is Elena Bryant testifying on behalf of Earthjustice and we’d like to testify in support of the staff recommendation for agenda items B1 and B2 and we implore this Commission to approve KIUC’s (Kaua’i Island Utility Cooperative) stream channel alteration permit and stream diversion works permit without further delay. These permits are the final approvals needed for KIUC to fulfill its monitoring and reporting obligations under the Waimea Watershed Agreement which this Commission has already ordered six years ago and that the community has been waiting for nearly seven years. I’d be happy to provide more context on the Waimea Watershed Agreement, if needed but basically the agreement outlined two phases and phase one went into effect upon Commission approval of the agreement which occurred in May of 2017. and that phase one required immediate restoration of flows to the maximum extent possible: simple modifications on the ditch system diversion such as removing a board or lifting a gate and also monitoring and reporting requirements. Here we are nearly seven years later and most if not all of these requirements have been outstanding and by letter dated August 2, 2023, Earthjustice documented these concerns related to ongoing violations to the Commission and asked the Commission to take prompt and firm action to enforce these terms. I had a chance to review ADC (Agribusiness Development Corporation) and KAA’s testimony and just wanted to make three quick responses to that. The first, we’ve held quarterly compliance meetings since 2018 and KAA and ADC have been parties at all of those compliance meetings, including the most recent one two weeks ago on January 11th and never once expressed any concern about KIUC fulfilling its phase one obligations under the agreement. As far as KAA’s requests to deny the application to allow additional time for collaborative discussions, we maintain that as outlined in our August 2023 letter, we’ve documented years of ongoing violations and progress in the compliance meeting remains painfully slow or non-existent. If anything, I think that track record or lack thereof speaks for itself. The testimony also raises the hydrologist meeting which was proposed to address what the modifications to the diversions would be done and reviewing the meeting summary notes that KAA provided to the compliance group. There’s nothing that’s going to be done to at least two of the diversions, Waiakōali and Kawaikōī. At the very minimum, these permits would allow KIUC to do reporting and monitoring of what is actually being taken into the ditch, what’s being put back into the stream. Waiakōali is especially concerning because KAA previously reported that there was a throwback that was returning flows that were diverted. We had asked for months for verification of that throwback, and it wasn’t until Dr. Ayron Strauch went up and verified that the throwback is not returning anything to the streams. I think at this point the Commission needs to take action and the first step is by approving these permits so we can get basic monitoring and reporting requirements fulfilled. I’m happy to answer any other questions that the Commission might have for me.
Aloha mai kākou, Commissioners. Good morning, my name for the record is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer and I’m appearing here today on behalf of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. I like perhaps many of the Commissioners when we saw the agenda last week thought, okay this is a fairly quick and straightforward action item, and we didn’t even plan to testify. Previously DHHL when these diversions were contemplated as phase one of a multiphase process of implementing the Waimea Watershed Agreement and the West Kauaʻi Energy Project thought it was a straightforward action. We were contacted by KAA Friday, I believe, and had a chance to talk to them Monday and the information that was conveyed to the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands was that...we have, if you don’t know, about 16,000 acres of land that are on the slopes above the Mānā plain and we have a reservation of 6.9 million gallons a day granted by this Commission to deliver water to some of those lands to allow settlement. We have a homesteader as well as a homestead association tenant on those lands now that rely on water that is diverted by the system. We don’t operate the system, we rely on ADC and KAA to deliver water in the system and what they have conveyed to us is that if these phase one modifications that are considered in both items B1, this item, and B2, the next item, go through there will be perhaps six months of the year where our tenants will have no water delivered to them. That’s obviously a very concerning issue since our tenants have cattle and plants and other things that rely on diversion waters. We have not obviously since this came up on Friday and getting more details midday yesterday had any chance to do any verification of any of these things. It does occur to me that most of the members of this Commission now are not members of the Commission when the Waimea Watershed Agreement was reached and that the very recent dissolution of the proposed West Kauaʻi Energy Project which was both a key part of the Waimea Watershed Agreement as well as the mechanism by which DHHL was going to be able to efficiently get at no cost to us water to our lands so that we could homestead those lands. The best path might be for the Commission to defer action on these two items to ask the staff and perhaps the parties to brief you both on the Waimea Watershed Agreement in general and its current status as well as the status of the West Kauaʻi Energy Project at your next meeting and then take up these permits with that background, perhaps at the March meeting. I would be happy to answer any questions.
Aloha, Dawn Huff here on behalf of KIUC. I don’t have any testimony, I’m just here to answer any questions if there are any.
Because we’re trying to understand the changes that have been brought by the modification of the West Kauaʻi Energy Project, we’re just requesting that the Commission defer or deny the approval of the permits for the moment pending resolution through the Waimea Watershed Agreement working group. With that I’m here to answer any questions to the extent that I can.
Since I’m new to this, Jonathan, I think you said that this past Friday you were informed that the homestead lands would not be able to get water if this went through. How come this came up so late? It seems to me that this has been going on for what, seven years? And then now right before a decision comes up? I would like anybody out there to explain to me what happened.
Chair, may I quickly respond because the question was directed to me by Commissioner Miike? The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands has indeed sort of tracked this closely and we were aware of this permit coming up. We had not evaluated it independently or considered it as what happens if phase two as contemplated in the Waimea Watershed Agreement didn’t occur. Again, we only heard from KAA this past Friday. What we have been doing since KAA informed us, so this is where it can get complicated. There were attempts at mediation informally among the parties to the Waimea Mediation Agreement to settle issues surrounding a lawsuit filed by Earthjustice on behalf of their clients over the adequacy of the environmental assessment prepared by KIUC for the West Kauaʻi Energy Project. There were many months of discussions, we were actively participating with the mediator in ways to address the various concerns of Earthjustice’s clients and have this project go forward. That was going forward until very late last year. We were then informed very late last year that this project was not going to go forward in its current form. There have been very preliminary discussions between KIUC and DHHL to see how an altered project could go forward that would provide water to DHHL’s lands and we’ve been participating in preliminary discussions along that. But the terms of the relationship of this stage of things to how it might affect immediate delivery of water for our lands, we were not aware of this concern from our ditch operator until Friday.
Can I follow up with Mr. Ross? You’re with ADC, Lyle? Lyle Roe, sorry. I guess I’m going to follow up with the same question that Larry is asking. Why is this only now come to a head? Has ADC been participating in these mediation discussions? Have you been aware of this?
Yeah, I’ve been in attendance for pretty much all of them, but we’ve only recently become aware of Dr. Gomez’s analysis, for me on around November 7th. I have an email here talking about it. For us, it’s sort of a new, for me anyway, it’s a bit of a new revelation.
I’m going ask, who else has looked at that analysis? It’s sort of been put before us as given, but who’s evaluated that? Do we just believe it or what?
I can say for ADC’s part we’re taking it seriously, but we’re sort of relying on the mechanisms of the working group and discussions with the parties including Earthjustice to vet this. We’re not asking that this application be forever gone, we’re asking for some time so that we can consider it, further evaluate it. ADC is aware probably more than anyone else of the length of time that has passed since the execution of this agreement to now. It predates my tenure here at ADC. We are aware of that, but we also want to make sure we do this right. I think this analysis...
Who can speak for that analysis? It seems if on one hand this has been dragged out for seven years and then all of a sudden at the last minute something comes up that would sort of suspend it. Seems to me a little strange. Besides just stating that there’s this analysis done, who can explain further to us what this analysis is and what is it about and how reliable is it?
Chair, maybe if I could speak for a moment for Kekaha Ag Association. I think before getting into the technical details which if we wanted to get into that I’d rely on Basil, our hydrologist. I think the broader context from the Kekaha Ag Association perspective is when we originally evaluated the phase one changes, that was in the context of it being a temporary transitional state of affairs before the energy project would be put in place. That’s a very different context than if that remains the permanent set of modifications from then forward. Part of the way we evaluated it, was there going to be unavoidable and potentially very lengthy disruption to service in the system as a result of the construction process. When you overlay that with, we expected disruptions due to the design in the phase one modifications, but we considered that those were likely to be unavoidable in any case if phase two were being built at the time. Because you would need to do that to renovate the reservoir, to renovate sections of the ditch. That was at least our internal evaluation. From a facts-on-the-ground perspective, from a water user perspective including KAA and ADC tenants and service users, that disruption was unavoidable and probably would overlap in time. If you were going to do that, that was the time to do that. The other sort of more administrative aspect to it would be if phase two did go into effect and even originally contemplated as part of the phase one plan would be a handover of the operational responsibility to the end users from the Kekaha Agriculture Association and ADC to KIUC at some point in that process. While we had reservations about the viability of those designs in the long term, they were also going to be another party’s responsibility. That was the context in which we evaluated the phase one designs.
Mike, again, I’m also new to this but there was discussion about a working group and I have a couple of questions. Is this working group statutorily created and what is its purpose and how do the outcomes of this working group intersect with these permits that are being requested?
Dean, you want to answer that?
If I can, the working group is we’ve initially started meeting quarterly. It’ll go maybe every two months at times, but basically it involves everybody, all the parties that were involved in the mediation agreement back from April 2017. Just to make sure that we’re moving, we’re doing our best to move forward on implementing the actions that were prescribed in the agreement.
Could you identify who the members of the working group are?
The folks that signed on to the mediation agreement was the West Kauaʻi Watershed Alliance which Earthjustice represents, Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative, Agribusiness Development Corporation and Kekaha Agriculture Association. I think that’s everybody, if I’m missing anybody please feel free to speak up and jump in.
I don’t think it was established by statute so it’s not a Sunshine committee. Then there was a mediated settlement that you were implying?
Correct.
It’s clear that there’s a lot of background that many of us are not up to speed on, the mediation agreement and compliance. But in looking at the scope of B1 it relates to monitoring and not the actual diversions. I think a lot of the testimony seems related to B2 so I guess I was wondering maybe from testifiers given Dean’s update that actually some of those phase one monitoring actions have been taken. Dean, you said Waiakōali stream gage was installed May 2022, Kauaikinana?
Correct.
It’s not necessarily true that nothing’s been done, something was done in May 2022 and we should sort of recognize that. It’s this gap, is sort of for the completion of those monitoring infrastructures, is that correct?
One gage was installed on Waiakōali and one on Kauaikinana, so this will provide for the installation of the remaining gages on the three streams.
Okay so I guess with that do any of those present submitting testimony...I think there’s some issues conflated in the testimony. Are there issues with the completion of the monitoring and this particular action item?
In particular I guess that’s directed to ADC and KAA.
Well, KIUC was the applicant, ADC and KAA.
They’re the ones who are having an objection or asking for a deferral.
Good morning, Chair. I think for our part we would prefer to treat them the same given that the phase two modifications probably aren’t going to happen or at least KIUC hasn’t committed to those. We would like to include the monitoring as part of the project just to make sure that everything with the changes to the project, everything that is going to change or possibly change with the modifications to the diversions is measured properly with those changes.
You see them as integrated, B1 and B2. You’re asking for deferral on both of those?
For ADC’s part, yes.
Question, Mr. Roe. Given that part of the monitoring is to understand the natural water availability, does ADC anticipate being able to access some of that surface water in the future? We don’t have data for these streams, correct? Is that true?
Dr. Strauch assisted with installation of those two gages on Waiakōali and Kawaikinana so uh we are collecting that data. I believe there is a USGS gage um on one of the streams. I don’t know if um Ayron is on the call, I don’t know if he’s able to speak to it at this point, but um yeah, we do have some data currently.
I guess my question is it seems to me we would still want to understand um these streams regardless and so it’s not wasted effort to measure and monitor them.
Ayron Strauch with the Stream Protection and Management Branch. Kawaikinana, we have a monitoring station that measures natural flow conditions of the Kōkeʻe Ditch. On Kawaikōī, there’s a USGS gage, long-term USGS gage that is about a half-a-mile upstream of the Kōkeʻe Ditch intake. Then on Waiakoali, we’re measuring low flows in the ditch. It was the easiest, most accessible place to install the station and under low-flow conditions, 100% of the water is currently being diverted at that location because the modifications to the dam have not been made. We are gathering and we’re now at about 18 months of continuous record data, I believe if my memory serves me right, with those low-flow continuous monitoring stations. These stations were operated as partial record stations for many years by staff, as well. We have some good data for these locations, at least with the Kōkeʻe Ditch monitoring station above Kōkeʻe Stream or upstream of the proposed modifications that KIUC is planning to make for phase one. That would help us understand how much water is going into the system because there are some small tributaries that also feed the system that aren’t being monitored and there is release of water at some locations uh below the Kawaikōī and Kawaikinana intakes um that put water back in the stream. We’re not at the moment monitoring how much is being diverted in total from the system um at that location. It would at least from a monitoring and availability standpoint, adding that one ditch gaging station would make a difference. I don’t think it would affect any modifications or issues that ADC is bringing up. That’s all I had.
Dr. Strauch, have you been able to review the recent report relied upon by KAA, submitted by Basil Gomez?
I was in the field all day yesterday. I’ve not been able to in the last 24 hours.
All of these actions are pursuant to uh the mediation agreement, the settlement agreement that all parties agreed to. When you bifurcated phase one and phase two in that agreement, was there a caveat that indicated that we would not proceed with phase one if phase two was altered? That’s in effect what’s happened, right? Phase two has been altered I want to come to that question. Secondly, whether KIUC had the unilateral right to make that decision given that they signed off on this mediation settlement.
I can read um directly from the agreement. It says, “phase one will go into effect upon the approval of this agreement by the Commission as part of phase one. The parties agree to immediately take steps to restore flows to the maximum extent possible, for example by removing a board or lifting a gate while working on the structural modifications pursuant to the deadline set forth in section B.” Obviously we did not meet a lot of those deadlines in part due to permits and approvals that were required. Phase two says, “phase two goes into effect if and when the KIUC Energy Project goes into service.” So there was a caveat if that energy project did not proceed.
But they clearly said that there are certain things that should proceed in phase one whether or not phase two happens.
Right, which was primarily the gaging and the implementation of the modifications to meet the instream flow standards that were established.
It feels like that’s exactly what’s happened, that phase two may not happen but the parties understood that when they signed off on the agreement, that it might not happen.
I’m not sure why and I get sometimes there’s new information and so forth or we have second thoughts about the agreement that we signed previously, but they did sign the agreement previously and recognize that there’s value in this data, it would be disruptive in terms of the service to install those gages and take those actions. But they committed to it and we accepted that settlement, so it feels like we’re re-trading all the hard work that went into finding that common ground. What’s the case in abandoning it at this point?
Neil, you raise a good point and I guess looking to ADC to Lyle and to Joshua to respond to that because you were part of the discussions, you were part of the settlement agreement. You also knew that phase one was separate and apart from phase two so what is the new information? It appears KIUC has decided that they’re not going to proceed, that was always a possibility given the lawsuit that was filed back in January of 2023. Why at this point in time is ADC and KAA seeing phase one as tied to phase two when that always appeared to be contemplated even under the agreement? If you could respond to that.
I’ll jump in real quick, for our part we still support completing these phase one modifications just with some slight alterations. We don’t know what those alterations might be yet and primarily to ensure that we can supply our tenants with, and DHHL frankly, with the water that in DHHL’s case, they’re entitled to. That’s our big concern here, is the analysis that shows potentially 40 to 50% of the time that ditch will run dry in which case we won’t be able to provide DHHL with the water that they’re entitled to. At this point we don’t really know what we don’t know given the changes to the West Kauaʻi Energy Project and so all we’re doing is asking for some additional time to be able to understand what those changes are and what some of those effects might be so that they can be mitigated.
My question is similar to Dr. Kagawa-Viviani’s question. What in B1 is objectionable that may impact the water delivery in B1 which is primarily the installation of monitoring. What in B1 is objectionable to ADC?
For our part, if the Commission were to approve this I don’t think we would have a huge problem with B1. I think it would be a little bit of a waste. We would have to go back depending on any modifications we made to B2, any modifications we made we’d want to make sure that we had the follow-up gaging to be able to verify what we had done and do that monitoring. I think it’s a case of both of these matters are tied together to the extent that we would want one to follow the other one, to complement the other so that we don’t potentially have wasted gaging or wasted effort if we’re going to make changes that aren’t currently contemplated in the applications.
Would you agree that the information that’s gathered from the data we collect pursuant to the installations in B1 would be important notwithstanding whatever changes you may have to the project in B2?
They could be, but if I understood comments earlier by Dr. Strauch a lot of that gaging already exists except for Kōkeʻe Stream.
Ayron, would you agree with that assessment that the items in B1 you have sufficient information with the existing gages, the only additional gage you need is what’s in Kōkeʻe Stream?
At this point Commission staff were under the impression that the ditch was going to be piped over Kōkeʻe Stream and Kōkeʻe Stream’s natural flow would remain in the stream and understanding the conditions that exist in that stream. It’s a relatively small stream and we’ve tried to make flow measurements there without much success. The Kōkeʻe Stream gaging station is not a high priority. I was more referring to the Kōkeʻe Ditch before the Kōkeʻe Stream. I think it was an acoustic doppler or a pressure transducer and a new control point installed by KIUC in the ditch that was being proposed and that would help understand how much water is available in the ditch.
One final question for me, what length of time of a deferral are you asking?
At the moment I can’t answer that, I would hope it would be really short. The hydrologist as we mentioned in our testimony, the hydrologists both from Commission staff, Earthjustice, and KAA Dr. Gomez, they’ve already met. I can’t characterize the nature of the report because I haven’t seen it but I know that their comments have been transmitted to Earthjustice already for proposed modifications to the existing plan for phase one. It’s my understanding that Earthjustice is currently reviewing those changes.
Are you asking for 30, 60, 90 days?
I’m not sure I’m qualified to answer that, but I would hope within 30 to 60. Again, I’m throwing a number out.
If I’m hearing everybody correctly the intent of what we want to do, there’s alignment on that, there’s no dispute about that. Question is as we now do the work uh people are going to be inconvenienced or out of service. There could be some damages created that are certainly unintended, in some cases possibly inevitable but not intended as damage. Because the virtue of the data has a long-term value so we undergo certain inconveniences for that purpose. When we issue you or approve a permit, is it so rigid that you can’t have dialogue with the parties and figure out ways to do that to fulfill the intent of the permit which everybody agrees about, but do it in the best way possible so that the inconveniences are minimized? I mean don’t you still have latitude if we improve this permit today to do some sensible things on the ground so people aren’t hurt?
A I think certainly for item B1 um which speaks to the gaging because certainly KIUC needs to coordinate with KAA and ADC possibly as far as what types of equipment to install because I believe the intent is that they will, once installed, they would be turning it over to KAA to manage and uh continue to maintain and report. In this case B1 I think it could proceed. I don’t know if it would hurt to defer it and come back um so that we have a better plan but I don’t think it’s so much of an issue with item B1. Item B2 is another story. I don’t know if I want to get into it too much because we’re not on the agenda item yet but um there were proposals that were developed in the modifications um based on the energy project moving forward. I can understand that there may be more um concerns moving forward on that permit.
Dean, can we hear from the applicant on item B1 as to what the impact is to ADC or KAA on that?
Aloha, thank you. First, I just wanted to clarify that for the monitoring, some of the monitoring can be done with or without the modifications. It’s independent of the modifications and other monitoring is integrally tied with the modifications because the monitoring is focused on monitoring the instream flow that is released at the point of the diversion, the amount of water that stays in the stream at the diversion. That aspect of monitoring is integrally tied so if the permit for B1 were to be issued we could do a portion of that but not all of the monitoring. I did just want to clarify that aspect. In response to the question about whether we can respond to the hydrology report or hydrology work, we have not seen it um so we can’t respond. I can say that the diversion modifications were designed to implement the phase one IIFS and they’re flexible so they can divert what’s available in the stream and they can implement the IIFS as its established in the mediation agreement.
Sort of addressing Commissioner’s earlier question of is this sort of modest tweaking or is this certain portions of the application that could not be completed as presented?
I’m sorry, can you repeat the question?
There was an earlier question saying that do we have the ability to modify the gaging stations to make it fit as built construction kind of things? Or are you saying that they are portions of the application that cannot be completed?
That’s correct, there are portions of the monitoring that cannot be completed without the modifications because they’re connected to the instream flow, measuring the instream flow that remains in the stream. The ditch portions of monitoring and streamflow portions of monitoring, the ditch flow Ayron named the point at Kōkeʻe Ditch before it enters Kōkeʻe Stream. That’s independent of the modifications. We could implement that portion of the monitoring but there are other monitoring points. An example is at Waiakōali stream at the diversion. There’s a measuring point there for the phase one instream flow standard that would remain in the stream. We could install equipment but that would not be able to be monitored until the modification was made because the modification itself would be the instream flow release point. I hope that makes sense.
Thank you, that certainly does add a little more clarity to what we’re talking about.
Dean, um if we approve a SCAP, there’s no obligation of the applicant to necessarily do all of it, right? We’re saying there is room for it not to be fulfilled given the sort of uncertain circumstances of KIUC’s project. Is that correct?
Yeah, you could issue a SCAP and they only complete portions of it.
We’ve already had that. I kind of want to move the discussion on to B2. I think B1 appears to be less...
I have one more question on this. Your license or access to the site itself, how is that to be resolved, Dawn?
The license that was spoken to earlier was a broader license that was primarily uh developed with the West Kauaʻi Energy Project moving forward. It has expired. If the permit is issued today we still have a procurement process to go through, there will still be a lead time on materials. So we have time and we would be more than happy to work with ADC on a limited right of access that would allow us to um get to the diversions and the contractor who’s going to implement the work, get to the diversions to do the work for monitoring or modifications or both. The work wouldn’t happen instantly after the permits are issued, there’s still quite a bit of lead time here before the work would go forward. We have some time to work with them.
Having said that, would it be a more reasonable approach to fine-tune your application to what work is actually to be done or can be done or should be done under phase one rather than having sort of this broad approach?
The proposal in front of you is and was designed for the phase one IIFS, it is not related to the energy project. The license with ADC which was developed under the broader terms of West Kauaʻi Energy Project moving forward and it was developed back in 2018 but the application in front of you is specific to the phase one modifications and not the energy project.
So it’s just principal gaging, no changes in flows?
It’s gaging and diversion modifications that would allow the ditch operator to implement the IIFS. Some of the diversions are passive, Waiakōali is a great example. It’s very difficult to maintain the IIFS at that diversion without some kind of modification. These modifications were designed independent of the energy project to allow the ditch operator to implement the IIFS, the phase one IIFS.
So, these hydrology reports have been issued. What’s the review time on that?
I have not seen them. We could review them relatively quickly and we would want to review them collectively with the rest of the working group and CWRM staff. I don’t think that would take a long time to do, a couple weeks maybe.
So that is not related to phase one at all?
If you’re speaking about the new hydrology that KAA mentioned, that KAA’s hydrologist has done, that’s new. There was significant hydrology work done through the working group, we had a hydrologist, Water Commission did their own work, each of the parties had a hydrologist. Specific to KAA’s new hydrology, we just have not seen that, but we could review it relatively quickly.
Chair, since I’m the person that did this analysis, could I clarify Dawn’s statement for a minute? This analysis is not new.
Could you introduce yourself?
Excuse me, sorry, I’m Basil Gomez, I’m KAA’s hydrologist. I’m the person that did this analysis and I would just like to correct Dawn Huff for a second. This analysis is not new, I was asked to revisit it in November when KAA learned that the energy project was not moving forward. I presented this analysis to Commission staff at a meeting held in the CWRM conference room on the 4th of December 2015. The analysis was presented to staff at that point in time.
I think Ayron was in that meeting. COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: When was this? CHAIR CHANG: December 2023, last month.
December 4, 2015.
I thought that was a mistake. Okay, 2015.
The analysis existed in 2015, the parties including the party you represent signed an agreement in 2017 to do this, so why are we revisiting it?
Yeah, that’s kind of my concern is that we as a Water Commission we’re supposed to be ensuring that the IIFS is being met and the fact that KIUC has changed their plan, that’s independent of ensuring the IIFS is being met. If there’s got to be changes to that, we still need good data. The good data is dependent upon the gages that are being part of B1. I’m ready to move on.
I concur, there’s another reason to do it. This is not the only place where parties have different viewpoints, and we urge them to mediation, and they worked really hard in mediation. We support that. When there’s an agreement, I think it’s incumbent upon us to enforce and honor the agreement. If we start letting people retrade agreements all the time, it’s hard to move forward and we don’t incentivize mediation and coming together as a community. The intent here is still that data is very valuable for a precious resource that is highly coveted. These gages will get us that data. As we issue a permit, number one, they have a right to not do it or to do it a little bit differently to accommodate other people’s interests, I hope our approvals give you that latitude so that you could do it the best way possible. The intent of the parties, the intent of the Commission is well served by getting these gages in place, so we have reliable data to make decisions upon.
I didn’t hear Dawn Huff on behalf of KIUC withdrawing the application. I think they also agree that there’s a distinction between B1 and B2. I also heard from ADC and in particular ADC perhaps not KAA that you were asking for some additional time but given Dawn Huff’s comments that even if we were to approve this today it would still take some time to actually install them. There is still time even within the approval process for you to continue on the discussions to review the reports and to have some input. With that being said, do I have any more questions or anybody else who we’ve not heard from that would like to make a comment?
MOTION: (KAGAWA-VIVIANI / HANNAHS)
To approve staff recommendation as submitted.
YES- (MIIKE/HANNAHS/CHANG/MEYER/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/HO) NO- (KATAYAMA)
