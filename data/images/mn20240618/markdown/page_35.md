**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** But of the reservations we have in place, how much of that is paper water did you say?

**ANDREW CHOY:** That's a good question, we'll have to look at in how many places where our reservations have been converted to wet water.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** I think it would be good information to have and just speaks to the challenge of fulfilling the mission of the Hawaiian Homes trust, that the land set aside to fulfill that were generally remote and without infrastructure. We're supposed to put Hawaiians on homes, but then we have to pay all the cost of developing the infrastructure, except we're calling new strategies of, let's go where the infrastructure is and acquire land that may not have come to us in the original trust. That's why it's so long delayed that it takes forever to utilize the reservations we put aside from you because you're out in Kaʻū or you're out in some remote area.

**KATIE ROTH:** Maybe that does need to be part of the conversation earlier on when we make these reservation requests come before us, is to think more holistically about where the water actually will be coming from.

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** Good point.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** There is a mechanism for addressing the double dipping, say that DHHL has a reservation for X amount of water and then over the years, part of that is being satisfied by public water systems. When you get to a point where you've maxed out the use at least on paper, the Commission will be starting to look at the actual allocation and uses of the permits in a particular area and we have the authority to reduce and reallocate. At that point in time, DHHL will say, well 30% of our reservation is being met by public water systems, so why don't you just reduce our reservation by that amount or at least if you resist, we can do it. But it harms nobody to keep that reservation when part of it is being met by public water systems and the issue only comes up when we're bumped up against the limit. I don't see a problem with a potential double dipping. One last comment is that your current head, Kali Watson has come full circle. He was in the cabinet when I was in the cabinet.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** I asked him the other day, were you on board? He said he was in high school.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** 26 years ago and he's still going. He must have been a very young man when he was with me.

**PUBLIC TESTIMONY - None**
