Briefing by Maui Department of Water Supply on the Development of a Water Shortage and Conservation Plan for Department Water Systems
Mr. Neal Fujii, CWRM, introduced Ms. Blumenstein, planning program manager and Ms. Fritsche, consultant who provided a briefing on Maui DWS’ water shortage plan, water conservation plan, and next steps in the process.
I have a question on the Stage 3 groundwater with the chloride levels. What’s the relationship with that target versus degradation of the aquifer where it has difficulty recovering? When you get down, fairly high chloride levels, it takes a while for the aquifer to recover. I’m wondering if you have any idea about the relationship with Stage 3 versus the difficulty of the aquifer getting back to drinkable water?
Mahalo, Commissioner. I can just get started and turn over to Jessica, as well. That’s an excellent question and one I have pondered for some specific well fields that have historically had spikes of very high chlorides such as the Kanahā wells in Launiupoko Aquifer that has through two decades recovered. But we don’t really know what that threshold is, will this well field recover? Is it detrimental to the aquifer? For those purposes as Jessica mentioned, they based the chloride or 95% of the Stage 3 chlorides on the findings from the USGS 2012 report on groundwater availability in Lahaina. There are other areas where, in ʻĪao Aquifer the Mokuhau well fields, for example, have seen some excessive chlorides over the years where it has recovered. But we do not know what that upper threshold is where you could have a damage to aquifer. This is just based on the historic production and chlorides data that we’ve seen for each system. Jessica, if you want to add anything?
Perhaps you should also have some target where you don’t draw any water from that particular aquifer because the way your stages go, you keep drawing water. You’re trying to reduce demand, but I’m assuming that you’re still trying to draw water out of an endangered aquifer.
Ayron Strauch of the Stream Protection and Management Branch. To carry on that part of the conversation, in Kāʻanapali in the Honokōwai Aquifer, Hawaiʻi Water Service manages a well field there of seven or eight wells. Their wells quite rapidly hit that 250-500, even higher, chloride content. They just shut down the well for weeks, if not months and they transfer the pumpage to the other wells. Not that that helps with the County system because they have a limited well field, but it might benefit all parties if well pumpage gets distributed across the aquifer a little bit more evenly to increase the likelihood that any individual well that hits that target will recover rapidly.
That’s part of this water shortage plan, although it wasn’t listed in any of these because it was focusing on demand, reducing demand?
This example involved a private water system, Hawaiʻi Water Service, which isn’t part of the County water shortage plan, I don’t believe.
Let me ask the County, then. In your water shortage plans, would you also be doing what he has suggested that the private sector has done? Instead of just focusing on reducing demand, how about trying to do structural changes in your withdrawal from the aquifers?
Yes, and that’s what’s been done historically when you see those peaking chlorides, you turn off that pump or find other ways to distribute water throughout the system. The way Carollo Engineers has proposed the response actions are demand side, but it doesn’t mean that those correlate to supply, they really have to translate to supply side operation measures as well. I don’t know if Jessica wants to address that part.
That’s part of the reason that we did the operational grouping of wells and we did the weighted production is because that is how the County operates now. When one well peaks in chlorides, they shut it down and they attempt operationally to get supply elsewhere. We did the groupings for that reason, we know they already have that flexibility in place and we didn’t want the triggers to be set on just a single well, speaking on chlorides, as historically that has happened. I can also just speak a little bit to the data and that historically the chlorides do go back to average levels following those peaks.
I have a question related to the chlorides, as well. If it’s weighted production, that means some wells are going to be much, much higher than those thresholds, right? Because you’re looking at the system average at a given time. That suggests Maui is planning to exceed those secondary requirements. My question is, you’re considering single sets of thresholds for very different geologic and hydrologic context across the system and some of them have quicker and some of them have slower recovery. Could you fold in the best science? I remember Scot Izuka’s report on, I can’t quite remember. Ayron, do you remember the report he presented a year ago on pumping effects? Hydrogeology. Was that also from Maui?
It was statewide.
Can we be sure that we’re considering that current science and that’s more recent than the 2014 report that you’re referencing. I know you guys want consistent triggers for groundwater, but some areas that you’re considering are wholly groundwater dependent while some of them are mixed. Maui can sort of mix to bring the chlorides down to remain in compliance, but for the areas that are 100% groundwater, wouldn’t you want to have more sensitive triggers? Would it make sense to do a little bit more tuning just for managing the aquifer and those very different geologic regions. Is that a question or comment? I guess it’s more a comment.
This is what we wanted from you also because we’re still figuring out the final format and what’s going to work both operational and for the Department. This is again, protecting the resource, making it reasonable, mandates or actions we can impose on the public. It may need to have a little more site specific while not being too...like Jessica said, we looked at well fields both from an operational standpoint and chlorides standpoint. Those ultimately is going to be how we implement the plan, but the way it’s presented here for the triggers, you’re just seeing the triggers for the whole system or district like Lahaina or Upcountry. In Central, it’s actually 8 or 9 well fields.
You have systems that have more or less spatially distributed wells, so your system vulnerability is different, tuning for that. I have a follow-up question for Commission staff which is, the utility is focusing on what it can measure, chlorides? But that doesn’t always address what we’re responsible for which is the effects on decreased spring flow or streamflow. We’re going to need to help provide information to them on that. Ayron, I don’t know if you have comments.
We are working on a comprehensive monitoring network with the County of Maui and they’ve been great cooperators with the USGS stream and groundwater monitoring across the county. There might be some issues with some of their metrics like 50% of the three-year average daily flow might not capture the acute stresses that are occurring on a three-week or four-week window, especially if there is no storage. That might affect both on the use side as well as the resource side. There are many ways to communicate hydrological drought and it’s not necessarily meteorological drought, but things that are affecting instream resources that we also need to consider. There are many ways to talk about the data that could be a little bit more effective.
This is really a question for Eva. What would you think about including a requirement that understates three conditions for groundwater management, a well recovery/well management plan be submitted to CWRM for review and approval only within a reasonable time period, say 30 days or something like that and only under Stage 3 conditions for groundwater. Would that be too much of a burden? Do you think it would be a reasonable requirement? Addressing the question of well recovery.
Maybe that should be already proactively defined. We sort of anticipate where those problem areas are, at least the well fields where we have seen a spike in chlorides and we know they have recovered operationally before. For sure for some areas there’s been up coning such as Mokuhau well field. If that was defined specifically in the shortage plan for the water use permit, that might be helpful now that that’s defined upfront. The trigger would be when we’re in the Stage 3.
It may not be necessary. CWRM could probably do something later if it was necessary but having it in there might be a road sign and provide some level of assurances that the utilities are watching the recovery program as well.
For my own education, this plan, I presume, focuses on DOW (Department of Water) reach and you mentioned that you have an ordinance pending before the Maui Commission, as well?
We have a draft ordinance that we are tweaking now based on the feedback from Carollo Engineers’ analysis. We hope to propose that in May.
My question and if you can help me with this, as you go through the various stages that you have outlined, what are your management tools/compliance ability and do you have the ability to reach out to other purveyors that are comingled with your resources? Or is this water plan just focused on the DOW resources?
Yes and no. We only have jurisdiction over our system and our sources, but we recognize this problem and challenge going back a decade and more, of course. Both in terms of there is a resource impact, not just an individual well operational capacity impact, it doesn’t matter who owns the source. We all lose if we are having a deteriorating aquifer or stream. For those reasons, we made a point in the scope here that we want to address both potential interconnections and shortage triggers of private purveyors. That’s why that’s the formal part of the scope, we’re meeting with the larger purveyors, the West Maui, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands on Molokaʻi, to explore what are the opportunities. Can you just buy in to this shortage trigger? Should they be different? Can we have contingency agreements with what we do in a shortage, including system connections? In terms of the bill that would impose some mandatory restrictions on water behavior, we are proposing some of those provisions would apply to private systems as well. That would make sense in terms of irrigation schedules, even though the County doesn’t have jurisdiction, we cannot pull their meter, it’s more like a buy-in from those systems to be consistent throughout the county when it comes to customer behavior and the severity of restrictions.
In the overall management of the system, who would be the organization responsible to ensure that the water systems remain intact?
The individual public water systems are responsible to ensure that we can meet demand. This is where we kind of needed assistance with defining that. We didn’t have clear indicators or triggers. It also left a lot of uncertainty on the customer side. Like , if we’re in a Stage 2, are these reasonable reductions and will we accomplish the needed reduction with those measures? That is what we engaged Carollo to do.
Is there a compliance element to this?
I’m sorry, compliance?
Yes, from the more critical stages especially if you’re in 2 to contemplating 3. Is there an organization that will ensure there is compliance?
Yes, for the Department, this would amend the existing County code. The compliance and enforcement of that now is fines and the last resort is the pulling of your water meter. We haven’t proposed any changes to the enforcement and penalties on it. If the County decides to adopt a bill that expands these restrictions to private purveyors, we don’t have that ability to monitor or enforce. That’s what I’m talking about, we need the buy-in from those to have similar enforcement mechanisms in place.
Ok, thank you, Eva.
Since we’re talking about Water Management Areas, the Commission has the power to limit the permit amounts, whether it be a County or private. At least from our side, we can do an overall reduction and I suppose that leaves it up to the purveyor to decide how they’re going to reduce allotment. We do have some powers over that.
Dean, the bill on the emergency water shortage, doesn’t that also address some of the issues that are being raised here?
Yes, the intent is to give us emergency powers regardless if it’s a water management area or not.
Right, that was one of the bills that was vetoed last year. Is that bill still alive this session?
Only in Senate Bill 3327.
It’s part of the larger bill. Not the individual bill, but as part of the overall. We’ll discuss that. Commissioner Hannahs isn’t here, but he raised a similar question to Wayne’s question. This is a DWS report, but it seems like it deserves a broader reach with the private purveyors. Eva, you mentioned that part of this plan was to reach out to the various other stakeholders, private purveyors, also Hawaiian Home Lands. What was the response from these stakeholders to the draft water management shortage plan?
The community engagement with the broader community was on the long-term conservation plan and where the community is going to be impacted. The shortage triggers, the potential interconnections, and contingency plans we are addressing next week, the next two weeks. We don’t have the feedback, of course you’re invited to the process and invited to participate, but we’re having one-on-one meetings with director and their management throughout the next two weeks, too. So, I don’t know yet.
That really is a missing component to this plan. Any other questions? I’m assuming there are members of the public who have signed up to provide comments to the Maui County’s plan.
This is for Neal, Planning Branch, I assume you have some conversations with other private purveyors. Is Maui DWS the only entity working on this, especially for the designated areas? Do you have knowledge of how progress is with other purveyors? We eventually will need it, right?
Honolulu Board of Water Supply, they have their own conservation program. As far as a proper plan, they came out with their water shortage and recovery plan for Oʻahu specifically to address the Red Hill issue. Honolulu Board of Water Supply is very aggressive in their water conservation. You live on Oʻahu, you see all of their advertisements. Maui is a close second. You see the ordinances that have already been passed regarding water conservation, show me the water bill, there are the new golf courses, non-potable. They’re very progressive in that sense. Kauaʻi Water Department, they have a water conservation program, but I don’t know if they are developing a proper plan. The Big Island, they also have water conservation efforts, but as far as an actual plan written up, I have not seen that.
What I was meaning specifically since we’re talking about Maui today, other private purveyors on Maui. For instance, on Oʻahu where we have Pearl Harbor water shortage plan, we have Board of Water Supply and the Navy’s water shortage plan, right? We have water shortage plans for every permitted or most permitted entities. Have you heard anything from other private purveyors or non- DWS purveyors on Maui about their work? Because it seems like we should be running these.
In terms of water conservation, no, we haven’t hear from the private. On Maui, the big ones are on the West side. Hawaiʻi Water Service, I haven’t heard from them.
Maybe we can nudge while we’re all thinking about this together. And I bring this up because it’s anecdotal, what I’ve heard of Texas where they have different irrigation water districts. You have people who are progressive next to people who aren’t and the conservation in one district benefits another and there’s inter-district tension because of it. The whole point with management is that we consider all of these together.
Good point. In water management areas, the permit holders are required to submit a water shortage plan, which is what Eva is talking about and it’s going to be turned in as part of their application for a water use permit. Each of the permit applicants are supposed to submit a water shortage plan. Now, the water shortage plan is not the same as a conservation plan, but there are elements that are very similar and they blend into each other. For example, Maui’s shortage plan, their 0 stage is just their general conservation. That could be a model to follow. The Commission has some say in that when they issue the water use permits. The way it works is the Commission only adopted the Pearl Harbor Water Shortage Plan and the way that plan is we have three stages of shortage. In Stage 2 is where we ask the water use permit holders to implement their existing water shortage plan that they had submitted. That’s how it fits in the individual shortage plans versus the aquifer sector wide.
I assume our CWRM side efforts will start moving shortly or in this calendar year as we consider permits and these submitted water shortage plans, is that correct?
What’s the question? Sorry.
Maui DWS is really aggressively tackling this shortage plan right now. It would make sense for us to also think about our aquifer system area plan, as well. Maui DWS can encourage their other purveyors to do their part, but we also can so I think we should. And let us know if we can understand how the Commission is doing our part to consider water shortage. I think that would be a good sign of leadership. Let us know if we’re making progress on it.
Sure. We’ll keep you guys posted.
There are several legislative bills that may have an impact on this. There are some tax incentive bills and hopefully with the County’s outreach, I’d be real curious to see.
I want to mahalo you, also. We really look for your feedback here, comments, what you see is lacking or whatnot because there is a void right now. There isn’t a statewide or an aquifer or any shortage plan for any Maui County designated area. We understand the Commission will ultimately review, you can approve, or have us modify the plan. We’re really going to make the best effort to cover what’s needed both by district and site specific and our best effort to get buy-in from the private purveyors, but it’ll probably be a while. We have consulted with the Groundwater Branch, with Ryan Imata and Bob and Patrick in getting a better understanding of what triggers would make sense or not. There are still so many components, I heard just from Ayron that maybe we get some of the surface water triggers wrong. The earlier we can address those, the better. This plan is not final. Mahalo for any feedback, criticism, we’d like to hear.
Thank you for your work in this area, this is a really important plan and you’re right on point, as far as I’m concerned in terms of direction and the steps you’re taking. Thanks for the effort. You’ve got a very tight timeframe here in terms of getting this done. It’s aggressive and again, thank you, it’s admirable.
I want to have an understanding on your BCAs (benefit cost analysis). Your BCAs, does that take into consideration the amount of water that’s being used? I look at, for example, irrigation and that has a really high value. Your BCA on that was 64.3, but the agricultural use is 4%. How is that calculated?
Thank you for the question. On the irrigation demands, we are looking also at turf grass irrigation and plants and that’s most of that. We’re actually not taking into account agricultural users in the conservation plan. We have BMPs as a recommended measurement, agriculture BMPs, Best Management Practices, in there but the irrigation measures that we’re speaking of targets watering of lawns essentially.
Your BCAs are reflective of the proportion of water use.
The BCA estimates how much, implementing that measure, what would be the water conservation savings in gallons associated with that. The way that you get to the BCA, the benefits side of it, say DWS did not have to treat or pump that water. So there is a cost savings associated with saving that gallon of water. That is what’s in the numerator of that value and then there is a cost to implement that program. Because there’s the irrigation scheduling is really just marketing time and enforcement essentially, some labor hours in there, it’s marketing hours. There’s no fixture associated with it, you don’t have to give away a $100 rebate to replace a toilet, so there’s not a lot of material cost in there. That’s the reason that has such a high BCA value.
I see. I just want to make sure I’m comparing apples and apples and we’re managing community’s expectations.
Aloha mai kākou. Thank you, Chair Chang, and members. For the record, my name is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer. I’m here today with the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. I have questions, but I understand I’m just addressing them to you. I will also address my praise for Eva to you, I share Commissioner Meyer’s gratitude for this work. It’s very important work. Certainly, I appreciated Neal’s description of where various counties are and it’s great that Maui is stepping ahead in a way that we would love to see all four counties step ahead in seriously addressing shortage and conservation issues. I have a few questions, one, and I appreciate the distinction Neal Fujii drew between the overlapping, yet distinct water conservation plans and water shortage plans. But I would like to reiterate that when DHHL was give the opportunity to review the draft Pearl Harbor Water Shortage Plan, and this was about three years ago, one of the questions we asked was do you have triggers related to potential contamination of the aquifer? The response of CWRM staff at the time was like that’s not for the shortage plans. It just seems that it might be useful in addition to these triggers around salinity and triggers around streamflow that should there be some event where contamination actually drives an inability for the system to deliver water, that that could also be some kind of trigger? Just a question. I’m not clear on how transparent the reporting on these triggers are so that interested members of the public will know, are we getting close? Are we not getting close? And then my fundamental set of questions have to do with whether and how equity was considered, equity and public trust principles were considered in the responses that are the 10%, 20%, 30% mandatory shortages. Across the board cuts, whether it’s of water or taxes or anything tend to have inadvertently inequitable outcomes. If you have a very large lawn and you have to reduce it by 10%, it’s different on your impact and your family’s than if you have a small garden. Right? That you’re taking care of and you have to reduce by 10%. Certainly, on Maui, both in the beneficiary community of Hawaiian Homes as well as the general community, there is often very frequently articulated concerns around water use between locals and tourists. Particularly given the challenges that were explored by you and your questions about public and private systems. Very, very frequently you hear folks Upcountry and Central Maui scratching their heads, wait, why can I not wash my car and then I look down at the resorts and everything is green and lush and the tourists are driving washed cars. Then also, particularly for DHHL, and I don’t necessarily have an answer for this, but if DHHL uses are a public trust use, why are they also cut across the board as non- public trust uses are during various levels of shortage. I’m not trying to express that there’s not a willingness by beneficiaries to reduce water in times of shortage, but what does it mean to have higher public trust use of water. And then fundamentally, I think, the last two points I’ll say is the articulation, if I heard it correctly from the Maui Department of Water Supply was that this allows for future growth in the system without developing additional sources. And so, I think a lot of folks just ask why are we concerned then? What is the ultimate goal to conserve water? And so, if I remember correctly and I often do not, but even during the 20- and 30% mandatory shortages Upcountry late last year, people were not complying, right?. And so, you have to ask why are people not complying? Do we have effective, as Commissioner Katayama was starting to question, enforcement mechanisms, monitoring mechanisms to do things. But I think also what drives compliance sometimes is if people feel that the rule is fundamentally inequitable, they tend to be a little less willing to comply with it. Those were just my comments, but again echo the deep appreciation for the work that MDWS is doing and we’re looking forward to our conversation about interconnections between their system and our system on Molokaʻi are going to be happening this coming week. Mahalo nui.
Thank you very much, Jonathan. Eva and Jessica are still online so I’m sure they’re taking all of comments that you’ve raised. Thank you so much. I’ll take people on Zoom. Kapua, did you want to provide a comment of B1?
Aloha mai kākou, my name is Kapua Sproat, for the record. I’ve been tracking Maui issues for far too long. I’m here today in my personal capacity and like everyone else, I really want to mahalo Eva and the County for doing this important work and especially for sharing your progress with the community. I did have just a couple of things that I wanted to flag for the Commission, though some of my manaʻo has already been captured by the Commissioners and Dr. Strauch. I do have serious concerns about using mean surface water for the surface water triggers. I’m not sure what that means and as we all know given the historically low flows that Ayron has been measuring all over but especially on Maui and in the Wailuku River, I worry about using a three-year average which is what was flagged on slide 13. I hope that Eva will continue to closely coordinate with Dr. Strauch on those triggers and will incorporate a hard floor in addition to an average as well as the other issues that Dr. Strauch flagged. Same for the groundwater, I think there should be hard stops on individual wells so we’re not just mixing with surface water to make sure we get to where we need to with respect to chlorides. I’ll just underscore the point that Jonathan made with respect to the public trust prioritization across the board. We aren’t seeking equity, a lot of folks aren’t. They’re seeking justice and fairness, especially where surface water is being taken. I’d encourage the County to look at prior public trust prioritization in incorporating the cuts. This is a question for the County that doesn’t need to be answered now but just something to think about. I remember when the County opposed designation of Maui Komohana in June of 2022, it said no need because it was utilizing a working group in order to kind of coordinate with the other water purveyors. This is especially important as you folks well know in Maui Komohana where the County is less than 30% of the water that’s being provided. What’s the status of that? I think as Commissioner Katayama highlighted, coordination is going to be absolutely essential and if some of that is taking place, great. If the county rule isn’t amended and Eva isn’t able to enforce with respect to private purveyors, then I think the Commissioner’s role in water use permitting and the individual shortage plans are going to be even more important as Dr. Miike highlighted. Mahalo to everyone.
Good morning, Chair, members of the Commission. Wayne Tanaka for the Sierra Club of Hawaiʻi. Just have some comments, first I just really want to appreciate the information and the discussion that’s provided in this briefing. I really appreciate the stage zero concept and its emphasis on the importance of proactive efficiency and waste mitigation measures. Along those lines, I did want to emphasize a few areas where I think efficiency and waste mitigation could be improved, whether by the County or by the State or even through your own advocacy as individual experts and probably some of the most informed folks on water issues, current water issues Statewide. For one example, according to the County, its intake infrastructure at Kamole Weir requires on average about 2 million gallons of water more per day than what Upcountry actually uses. That’s about three quarters of a billion gallons per year and given how precious and increasingly scarce our water resources are becoming, it may be worth investing in ways to improve the efficiency of this infrastructure among other things for the security of Upcountry folks. There’s also county-wide dependency on unlined reservoirs that collectively leak tens of millions of gallons of water per day and my concern is if there is a prolonged drought, for example, and we do not prepare by requiring reservoirs to be lined or requiring less wasteful infrastructure, these reservoirs could empty themselves during prolonged drought periods and that would leave ag users and others high and dry. I do appreciate the progress that’s been made regarding reuse. After many, many years the Lahaina Wastewater Treatment Plant is finally on its way to recycling some of its wastewater and in that case we not only are reducing the strain on potable water sources by not using them for landscape irrigation and so forth but we’re also reducing the impacts on the nearshore ecosystem. My understanding is the Maui Komohana community, this is a high-level topic of discussion within that community, as well. Finally, along the lines of what Dr. Scheuer was saying, contamination in my mind is tantamount to the waste of what would otherwise be drinkable water. We know, this island in particular, how contamination can create water shortages, sorry my video stopped, even when there’s relative abundance. PFAS or forever chemicals, we’re beginning to really become aware of them and how they effectively last forever and can migrate throughout environment into our water sources over the course of decades or even centuries. While we have currently limited options to deal with the existing contamination of these forever chemicals, what we can do is prevent even further harm by banning them. There are legislative vehicles in the Hawaiʻi Capitol like HB 1896. There’s federal legislation that could be strengthened like the FAA Reauthorization Act. These things could use your support, the Commission’s support or even just your individual support as advocates and experts and stewards of the water resources. Those are just some comments and thoughts, not all these things are controlled by the County, some are in your wheelhouse, some might require legislation, but all in all I’m just very glad for this discussion and hope that we can all work together to address these efficiency needs and protect our water security and our future. Thank you.
Thank you for the opportunity. I am an executive assistant for Council Member Paltin, so I’m speaking on her behalf, I’ll just give you her testimony. She apologizes that she is not able to be here today because she’s appearing before the legislature and she has been deeply engaged on these issues and works tirelessly to craft housing solutions for those impacted by the August 2023 fires. After hearing this item and also thinking ahead to item B2, in particular, it’s incredibly important to Council Member Paltin and the community, which has repeatedly asked to be centered in decision-making that impacts Lahaina especially with respect to the fire recovery, and based on the information that is presented and will be presented it’s unclear whether any more information will be shared for Leialiʻi, in particular. While she’s always supported housing solutions, she’s also concerned that water for the Kāʻanapali project appears to come from the Honokowai Aquifer which is already threatened with over pumping. In wrapping up, Council Member Paltin would like to request to be kept abreast of the water sources for the temporary emergency housing being considered for Kāʻanapali 2020, Leialiʻi and any other potential sites and requests regular updates for what comes of this for each of the temporary emergency sites being considered. Mahalo.
Aloha mai, Kalamaʻehu Takahashi here. Just was mainly here to get more information but just wanted to mahalo CWRM and DWS for organizing these efforts. Sorry, I’m unable to start my video because we have issues with connectivity where we’re reporting in from, so I’m going to respectfully leave my video off for the time being. Certain reservations that I have also with the Kāʻanapali 2020 project are in fact that they are drawing from the Honokowai Aquifer which is an aquifer that has been previously identified as some place that’s been overdrawn at the current time and I think that’s something that we should look to consider. I would also like to just mahalo and echo the sentiments of Dr. Scheuer’s and Dr. Sproat’s comments earlier as well regarding equity and the inclusion of the Lahaina communities in future consultations and these efforts. Particularly as a researcher for our culture research firm, I have serious issues with the lack of cultural historical information that is layered into these sorts of metrics and we’re talking about impacts and what we propose as certain uses. Denying the fact that these areas are in the footprint of the Malu ‘Ulu o Lele and that these are chiefly and also highly populated areas in the cultural historical past is not an excuse for us to be fast tracking these types of projects for the benefit of people that we cannot guarantee are going to be our local community members. I would just ask that we have more inclusion and consultation with the community in regard to the histories of these things and looking forward to more accountability to our private purveyors and users if they refuse to comply with integrating resources with the larger community. And just to keep the community more involved. Sorry, all over the place but here for information. Thank you for your time and willing to answer any questions or anything like that moving forward.
Yes, I have a question for testifier Kalamaʻehu Takahashi and you mentioned your concern over the lack of assessment of impacts and certain uses and as a cultural resource specialist and someone from the area, knowledgeable, if you have thoughts on the metrics that matter. If the metrics we’re using aren’t the right ones, do you have suggestions? You might refer to streamflow, but if you have pointers, if you can articulate them then we can make sure to include them.
Yes, thank you. Off the top of my head I would say that examining traditional water systems prior to the current ones that we are operating within which were illegally built and had a very heavy impact on our cultural resources and the and the socioeconomic parameters and lifestyle and even policies to a certain extent that allows for us to live within a utopian setting where our communities, their families, and future generations for an extended amount of time beyond their own lifetimes would be able to sustain the populations that are living in these areas. For example, I don’t know what the metrics would be but if we were to look at the land use and the irrigation metrics for using the square footage of a golf course or a water feature or a waterfall, how much water that uses as opposed to some other uses such as the regrowth or reforestation of the Malu ‘Ulu o Lele, I think that would help to solve a little more issues. When we’re talking about housing and spacing, feeding our families and just trying to prevent any sort of other climate disasters like the fire from occurring again, I would just like to sum it up by saying that we should examine our cultural past and integrate these systems and integrate that knowledge, use that as the basis for socioeconomic justice and equity that we can use as we try to navigate these spaces towards mitigating the current issues and the issues that we’re going to face as a community in the climate future under these extractive economies. Sorry, again just all over the place, but please let me know if that was an answer to your question. I’m not an expert in all these things like the measurement and certain stuff like that but I do see the value in honoring our stories and our histories and what the landscape was like before the arrival of these foreign interests and these destructive powers. I don’t have an issue with who’s living here and who’s consuming these resources, but it’s just that we collectively need to find ways to [inaudible] these resources. [lost connectivity] We have descendants of the mahiʻai, we have descendants of the konohiki, we have descendants of the aliʻi and stuff like that and that’s the reason why we should look to our communities. They know the best, they have the most stakes, they’ve been here the longest, and I think that they’ll be here much further afterwards. That’s it for now, although I apologize I cannot answer the question clearly at this time. I am also available to be contacted thereafter for further just talk stories or opportunities for us to collaborate in these conversations moving forward.
I just want to suggest for broader conversation, we have the metrics at the Commission that we use because that’s what the technology enables, but for these tricky problems, maybe thinking more creatively and expansively about metrics that aren’t measured by the Commission but are measured in partnership with community to know that we’re making progress towards the goals we’re going towards. In education we use SATs but we know they’re flawed metrics. So, what are the metrics we should be using because that’s kind of the way our system operates at county and state level. We do need metrics, as flawed as they are, if they get us closer to measuring the things we value then that’s going to lead to better decision making. Please do, as you think about it if there are metrics that the Commission or Maui DWS can consider as they think about conservation and triggers, not just from the public utility, drinking water side but more broadly. I think that will help the Maui water conversations.
I guess in my mind, tagging on to Aurora’s comment, whether they’re metrics or not, we have Ka Paʻakai analysis that really looks at quantifying impacts through traditional customary practices, but what I hear a lot in all the different conversations we have is just the need for community engagement. Too often communities aren’t part of the process to participate in at least providing information. Our Commission meetings we provide a public forum and I also appreciate Eva. You guys have had several broader community meetings in the different areas to also get input, but I do think we all have to try more deliberately and consistently to engage communities whether they’re in a working group or through community meetings, rather than when a decision needs to be made up. I guess that’s each one of us, each one of the government entities trying to do that in our own relevant way. That’s my own comment.
Listening to many of the comments, what they’re really asking is for reapportionment of current water uses which I think at least for the Department from Maui, is beyond the scope of what they’re trying to do. I think the onus falls on the Commission to take a look at that. We’ve always just sort of handed out permits as they applied, but the bigger issue is looking at the overall area that we’re giving out permits, how should those be apportioned? Some of the issues that have been brought up was that we have priority areas, we have public trust purposes and they probably don’t match how we just handed out permits as they came up one by one. I don’t want to put this burden on the Department of Water Supply on Maui, otherwise their shortage plan will never move and I think that should be for us to address in some future agenda.
I think you’re absolutely correct, but it just reemphasizes the need to have water management area designations because that is the vehicle to ensure this much more comprehensive coordinated view.
