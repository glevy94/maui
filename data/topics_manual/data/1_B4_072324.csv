Submittal of Policies on Permitting Water Use Transfers for Agricultural Use Where the Transfer Entails a Division of Parcels of End Use, and Pump Replacements for Pumps Greater Than 27 Gallons Per Minute That Have Not Been Used For The Previous Four Years
Staff stated the summary of request that the Commission modify ground water permitting requirements in cases pertaining to agricultural uses.
I have a comment from Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani. She says, one, she supports more tracking of old wells where pumps haven't been used. We need to think about culling uses as we face future water scarcity, and two, I think Ryan has already addressed the recommendation, please clarify that Recommendation #2 applies to both water management areas and non-water management areas.
I can amend that in the actual or maybe we can amend that in the recommendation.
Thank you, Chair. Ryan, how is the capacities for inactive pumps factored into the sustainable yield calculation?
The capacity in the sustainable yield. We actually track pumpage in aquifer systems by the actual pumpage. I know that sometimes there's some correlation between a pump capacity and pumping at 24-hours a day. We generally don't factor in the idea that somebody will pump 24-hours a day in calculating out sustainable yield, but we do regularly track how much is being withdrawn from an aquifer at any given time. I think your question is pertaining to aquifer protection as the way that we look at things. But again, it's not just pump capacities, we look at deep monitor well data, we're looking at water levels, we're looking at salinity, we're looking at profiles in terms of the groundwater levels and then the top of the transition zone from fresh / salt water midpoint. I'm sorry, going a little bit beyond your question, but looking at aquifer health from just the perspective of pumpage is just one facet of it. We're also looking at aquifer profiles, so in that sense we don't look at 24-hour pumpage of pump capacities in terms of evaluating what are going to be the impacts to sustainable yield overall. I hope that answers your question.
But how does that correlate when you issue water reservations in an aquifer because that's inactive, basically. And there’s no sunset on those.
On the reservations, yeah. I think that reservations might be looked at a little bit differently between management areas and non-management areas because in a management area, regardless of your pump capacity, you'll have an allocation and you have to limit the pumpage to that allocation. In that case, instantaneous pump capacities, what I mean by that is gallons per minute, we don't look at as much as we look at the actual allocations.
If someone were just to reactivate a pump, would that fall under this four-year sunset?
That's a good question, I guess we should amend that. Here's one situation that I see. In Pāʻia, Mahi Pono has these 5,000, and I don't want to pick on anybody, but they have these 5,000 gallon permitted pumps that have been non- operational for a long time and they want to replace those pumps. Now, I'm looking at it from the lens of, I don't know how long they're going to pump and it's not a management area. If they put 5,000 gpm (gallons per minute) pumps and they pump them for 24 hours a day, that's going to far exceed the 8 mgd (million gallons of water) sustainable yield. That's the reason why I want to bring the replacement to the Commission, but your comment is a good one, if it's just reactivating a pump. I just don't know what regulatory mechanism we have for somebody that's reactivating a pump. Maybe that's something the Commission can discuss is if you're reactivating a pump, what permits are required. I don't know because well and pump permits, they're issued for one point in time. It doesn't imply that you can use a well or it's issued to the driller and the driller gets a permit to install a well, install a pump and then beyond that, the landowner has a correlative right to use the well and the pump the way that they see fit. I think there are opportunities for us to revisit those things. I don't want to say it's a slippery slope, but then where do you think in terms of when people have in a non-management area, have a pump capacity, and then want to ramp up pumpage to 24 hours a day versus three hours a day. It’s a difficult thing to address, I'm just hoping that in this submittal I can address some of the issues that we're facing and again this is for transparency. I don't want to delegate things to the Commission where I think that there are questions that come up. Again, with respect to the agricultural subdivision issue, I've been getting some comments from the public saying that, hey you're transferring this water use permit from one guy to another guy, but we don't think that they're good stewards of water. In the transfer I want to make sure that there's due process and that there's opportunity for a better process. Again, I will say that that's a great concern that you raised, Commissioner Katayama and we'll try to address that issue.
Part of it was answered, but if you have a pump insulation permit in a water management area, you also have to get a permit for withdrawal and if it's non-use, we can say you've abandoned the use and we withdraw the permit. Now in the non-management area, don’t we have authority for abandonment of wells?
Or non-use, yeah. I think that we can require somebody to abandon a well if it's not being used.
We have that authority, the question is how long it has to go before there is an abandonment, but can’t we just sort of notify people that if we see they haven't done anything with the well, after four years can't we just send them a notice that we're going to start processing an abandonment of well unless you come back with information?
Then even in non-management areas, once they put in a pump, don't we follow what they pump?
Yeah, we track. As long as they're reporting their water use, we're tracking what they're pumping. We can certainly implement a program whereby if somebody doesn't pump for a certain period of time, we can require them to abandon the well.
So, we have authority to do those things already, right?
Oh, yeah. As you noted in the first or second submittal, the Commission has broad authority for a lot of things, but I think we have stronger standing to require somebody to abandon a well. We prioritize abandonment of wells where there's a potential for contamination. I think that's our first priority.
Larry, your comments and Ryan, your comments are appropriate. I think following the situation and allowing the well owner, landowner, farmer, user of the land some flexibility to explain their actions is valid and appropriate. Farming, as you guys know, can have longer periods of pre-productivity where new plants across hundreds or even more acreage may need to be raised in a greenhouse or developed in controlled conditions and they don't actually reach the point of being productive in terms of their full capacity and need for water until 5 years, 8 years down the road. Those are circumstances that I would think it would be in the best interest of the Commission and the public to accommodate those, provided they’re explained and provided staff has a chance to understand that and make those allowances accordingly.
That's the reason why my proposal is to take it to the Commission because there's a lot of perception that staff has too much discretion in making decisions about these things. Where there's the opportunity to explain things, I want them to explain it not to me, well they do explain it to me in my submittal, but they explain it to the full Commission and the Commission makes the decision rather than staff making the decision.
That's certainly great, Ryan. Thank you.
Ryan, my question is and I'm not as familiar with the abandonment process, but is there a notice requirement and a due process? So, someone has a permit and even if they're not using it, before we decide to change the terms of that, are we required to put people on notice that if you don't use it for four years?
A couple things, I think the first thing is if we're talking about management area versus non-management area, there's two questions right - your allocation and your requirement to abandon and seal the well. Regarding the allocation, there's clearly a process spelled out and that is in 174C-58 where it says that if you don't use water for a period of four or more years, a Commission can permanently revoke your permit, but I think it's subject to a hearing.
After a hearing, one, they have to be given notice and then a hearing.
174C-58 doesn't apply to non-management areas because these are for water use permit applications.
So, your recommendation that, “has not been used for four years shall require...even if the pump installation is less.” I'm just wondering do you have to put everybody on notice first and give them an opportunity to? I guess I'm just wondering, are you planning to put all of these users on notice that you haven't been using it?
No, I'm sorry, I think that there's some confusion. I wasn't clear enough, so I apologize in my submittal. When I talked about partial or total non-use, I wasn't talking about revoking anybody's use, I was using that as an example just to frame the time period with which we look at things that are not being used. My recommendation is for pump replacement. If somebody wants to replace a pump, again I'll cite the Department of Water Supply example, if they're pumping a well continuously and the pump goes down and at the Department of Water Supply on the Big Island, Keith Okamoto can speak more to this than I can, but I think pumps go down and it takes them some time to get it back up. They might not have had continuous pumpage for six months or 12 months or whatever while they get a contractor in place and they order the pump and they do all of that stuff. Just thinking about those kinds of delays, I don't want to add the permitting as a delay in addition to that because what I think is that pumping that quantity isn't really changing the aquifer. It's not going to impact anything significantly. I was just saying that for replacements, if it's greater than 27 gallons per minute and it hasn't been used for four years, you just need to get a permit from us. I'm not going to do a wholesale evaluation of every well that has greater than 27 gpm, and I think that's a discussion for another day. Dr. Miike and Commissioner Katayama's concerns, I'll think about that and think about a subsequent action that we can propose to address those kinds of things.
Okay, thank you for that clarification. I misunderstood the presentation.
Ryan, you can look at all these pumps that have been installed and you know whether they're pumping anything at all.
All I'm saying is that after about four years or more, you can just send them a notice saying, we're going to consider this an abandoned well unless you respond and tell us why not. What we're doing is giving them notice that they should come back and let us know.
Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
I feel uncomfortable with all of these wells out there with pump permits and they're not doing anything and then at any time, they can start doing.
I agree.
I agree with that, too. That does appear to be in support of what Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani said. Is that possible to add that to the recommendation, Ryan, or do you want to handle that in a different way?
This is just related to permitting. I feel that those are very legitimate things that we need to address, but number one, I think the AGs can opine, that we didn't notice that particular discussion, so I don't feel comfortable about making a recommendation that we didn't notice to get the proper feedback. I would propose, let's look at that as something as a separate action so that we can notice that publicly and then we can get stakeholder input and do more research into it.
Wait, I don't see why we need to get a formal declaration about how we're going to do that. All I'm saying is that we can just say, look you haven't used your well in X number of years. Come back and tell us why, if you don't tell us we're going to consider starting a process of abandoned wells. I don't see why we need to have a formal decision on that, that's already in the code.
I would agree with that, Ryan. It seems an operational issue, not a policy and that one that you can implement, but I think it is appropriate to inventory and put people on notice before we take any formal action. It is a good idea to inventory and monitor these.
If you look at my last submittal, given the amount of things that we have to do. I agree it's a great idea, implementation-wise it detracts from the other things that we need to do. I agree it's important and I think that we need to look at it and maybe another thing that we can do is we can brief the Commission on some of the things that we're looking at in terms of... We have, I don't think Katie (Roth) is here anymore, but we have a programmatic agreement with the Department of Health looking at possibly having an abandoned well program.
She's in the room, Ryan.
I can't see the room, so I thought she had to leave at 10. Maybe we can do a briefing to the Commission on that and look at that, but I agree, it's an important thing to implement.
We're not, at least I'm not asking you to do it right away. I'm just saying that we should start doing something like for example if you get a summer intern, that intern can go look at all these well permits and see what's going on in that. I'm not saying prioritize this way up, I'm just saying we should start thinking about it and start doing something about it.
Or you can get an AI (artificial intelligence) to go through all your files. I chuckle, but I suspect there might even be a program that could go through...that's far beyond this agenda item.
Ryan, number 1 - transfer of existing groundwater permits for ag. I don't know how many transfers you have, but in certain programs within the Department of Health what we do in the permit itself, we say that the permit is only good for the permittee and that if they're going to transfer, they have 90 days to notify us. I'm just concerned that if it all requires approval of the Commission, if you don't give a time frame that we're going to have, again I don't know how many of these transfers you have, but we could have a lot that has to come to the Commission.
Sorry, I'm trying to understand the question.
In the Department of Health, we have permits that we issue and we say the permit is only good for the permittee and if they want to transfer the permit to someone who's buying the operation, they have to notify the Department within 90 days of the transfer and that gives us an opportunity to review the new application. If this transfer is going to happen and it has to come to the Commission, my concern is that if you don't give a time frame in which these transfers have to notify the Commission and that they have to come before the Commission, that we might get backed up.
That's a good question. I will note that in 174C-59, the State Water Code, the new landowner is required to be informed of the transfer within 90 days, so I think that echoes what...
It just doesn't say it in the submittal, that's all.
Is that a standard condition? Land Division for 171 permits, there are standard terms and conditions, any transfer, any assignment requires notification. Is there some things that you can rather than getting Commission approval that it is part of your standard terms and conditions of the permit?
The reason why I want them to be presented to the Commission, again I will cite that situation or I'll cite situations where there's a transfer of the water use permit. Say it's to a previous big agricultural user like Del Monte or Wailua Sugar or Dole or whatever and it's being transferred to a purveyor that's then going to provide water to a use that's not necessarily the same. I'll say that in some cases there may be transfers of use from pineapple to gentleman estates and I think those are opportunities - again I'm trying to take the discretion out of staff's ability to say that if it's going to be used for a different type of use that's agriculture, but not quite agriculture that we present it to the Commission for approval. The Commission can say, well we approve this transfer or we don't approve this transfer. Then maybe the action is that the Commission says, well you got to apply for a new water use permit because the use is not the same, in other words rendering that [174]C-59 Condition 1 not applicable, that's what I'm saying.
Commissioners, if I may. Ryan, correct me if I'm wrong, the transfers are typically handled ministerially, is that correct?
Yeah, again that's why I'm trying to take it out of staff’s hands.
Ryan cites 174C-59 that states the Commission is informed of the transfer or should be informed of the transfer within 90 days. The recommendation only speaks to the approval of those transfer requests, that certain ones we want to bring to the Commission for approval versus the rest would be handled ministerially.
What I can say, too, is that part of the Code says, “a permit may be transferred in whole or in part from the permittee to another.” It's saying that it can be, but I'm trying to frame it under this lens that the Commission staff and the Deputy doesn't have the ultimate power to make decisions about how things happen, rather I think it goes to the Commission so the Commission can make those decisions. It's the loophole that I'm seeing in our process that allows us to approve gentlemen estates. I'm just saying it plainly or any agricultural use where the agricultural use is different from the previous agricultural use and I don't see the same quantity of water being necessary for the new use. That's what I'm saying.
I know that, Ryan, you're trying to find this really nice balance between transparency, objectivity, what comes before the Commission, what's discretionary versus what's ministerial. It's always a hard balance to find.
Ryan, has the Department of Ag(riculture) had any comments to this? Have they been aware of this?
I don't know if they're aware of it, but I haven't received comments on it.
I'll make one comment. Series of Supreme Court decisions have said that when we permit agriculture uses, we have to be basically crop specific, now. You can't just sort of say “agriculture,” you can't just say because sugar used to be about 7,000 gallons an acre. Pineapple is maybe 1,200 and so that's a big range. At least when we say about change in use, it should reflect what we do under the Supreme Court directive. Agriculture is not just a uniform number.
Thank you for that, that's exactly how I feel and I think that it's the Commission's responsibility to make sure that where these transfers are happening that again, we apply our evaluation specific to what kind of agricultural use it is. As an example, I'll cite Kunia where they converted from pineapple. I was out there looking at the pineapple fields in the very beginning and then now it's all seed corn and it's all different types of crops. I think it's important for us to have the ability to look at what you said in terms of the Supreme Court mandate, for us to look more specifically at crop specific water requirements where these transfers are happening.
Ryan, does the Department of Ag(riculture) have a criteria for water use of different crops? Do they have a standard?
I believe they do, but I think that in establishing what water duties are and maybe Neal is on the call, maybe he can answer this more. He has more knowledge about this, but I think that they use a certain set of calculations to determine what they need in terms of long-term use of water. We're looking more in terms of allocating water for a very specific period so that we can have equity across all the water use permits that we issue and it's basically looking at a one and five-year drought period and it's using our IWREDSS program to look specifically at root depths. We look at isohyets to determine rainfall, we look at rain gages to determine evaporation and we have a specific set of circumstances that looks at calculating water uses. DOA (Department of Agriculture) uses more long-term projection for what kind of water uses are necessary.
I think the Supreme Court decisions, especially when we were looking at the Waiāhole and the use of Larry Jefts and those farmers, said you had to be specific for a crop in a particular area because they change so much. The DOA budgets for crops are basically generic, they got corn, whatever else, and it don't consider where they're growing that stuff, whereas ours do.
Yeah, ours does.
Also Ryan, it's seasonal because in the summer where you can, rates are higher, you need more water. If you take an average of, let's say 1,000 gallons per acre, you may use none of it in the winter. It may use double of that during the summer, that's the way it goes. The other issue is the efficiency of your system, we always talk about where is the water being measured at? Is it top of field or is it at top of delivery system, diversion? Then you have to comprehend the efficiency of the system.
Definitely, I think that brings into consideration two things, maybe we need to think about doing a briefing to you guys regarding how we use the IWREDSS program - that's the program that was developed in conjunction with the University of Hawaiʻi to help us assess if somebody's application for water use for agricultural uses is appropriate.
It's a good program.
Maybe I need to or staff needs to brief you...our surface water guys use it, too, and I think it'll illustrate to you guys that we do accommodate the seasonal variability, we accommodate different irrigation types, and as Dr. Miike said, it's very place specific. We're looking at rainfall isohyets, we're looking at pan evaporation, we're looking at all of that data in order to come up with that calculation and also projecting it out long-term to account for a one in five-year drought scenario, to accommodate for the rainfall. It might be a good opportunity for us to reinforce some of the things that we do in terms of how we arrive at the calculation. I will tell you that regarding system efficiencies and system loss, we do account for that in terms of the actual irrigation. If you're using overhead sprinklers versus drip irrigation, it requires a different quantity of water. But we're not looking at system losses in terms of what you said, assessing at the source or assessing at the end-use. I know Neal doesn't like to use percentages as system losses, but what if you have 20% system loss or 50%? It was accommodated and Dr. Miike knows that system losses were accommodated in Waiāhole in terms of the Commission issuing an allocation for system losses. I can't speak for the surface water side of it, but I do know that that's the only groundwater situation in which we did incorporate system loss into the equation and maybe that's something that we need to look at further. Your comments are well taken.
