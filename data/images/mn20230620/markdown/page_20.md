We're also protecting our water from contamination. We have a bill that's just been introduced to county council to establish wellhead protection in overlay districts so that there's less risk of well contamination, you know, in the area of the wellheads.

We've got a lot going on in water conservation. We -- we're retrofitting all of our meters with Smart Meters. Smart Meters allow the meters to be read remotely, which has a couple of advantages. One is the meter reader doesn't have to physically go to the meter, but the other advantage is it provides real-time information on water use. And back in my -- I came from California. My career back there, we did a study in one of the cities I was in, and the Smart Meters decreased water use 15 percent -- we did a pilot study -- because people can get real information on how much water they're using and it also detects leaks. So if -- like, if the meter is running 24 hours non-stop, you get a note, hey, you may have a leak, so it really helps with water conservation.

We're also -- have landscape incentives and guidelines as well as requirements. And we're working out a water conservation bill to introduce to the -- to the county
