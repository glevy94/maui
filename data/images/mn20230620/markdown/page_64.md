to do a comparison between someone who's using sort of this --  
this less intrusive material versus others who are doing  
traditional construction. Is there a difference on the  
impacts to our -- our ecosystem? I -- I don't know. All I'm  
suggesting is if there's a mechanism for us to utilize these  
applications and these projects as they come before us to sort  
of share in this inquiry.  

DEPUTY MANUEL: And maybe -- maybe if I can, Chair,  
and maybe a recommendation is we can maybe tap City and County  
of Honolulu as well as Department of Health's Clean Water  
Branch to maybe come in and use their, you know, NPDES permit  
as a way to kind of share, right, the BMPs, the technologies,  
the work that they have and are currently doing. And then  
maybe areas where they need more help --  

CHAIR CHANG: Yeah.  

DEPUTY MANUEL: -- or more data, and that's where  
maybe we could fill the gap on the policy side. Maybe that's  
a recommendation I can propose and can bring it -- bring them  
to the commission and see if they're willing to engage at that  
level.  

CHAIR CHANG: I just want to be constructive, but I --  

DEPUTY MANUEL: Yeah.  

CHAIR CHANG: -- I also realize DLNR, we don't have  
enough resources to do what needs to be done, but we know
