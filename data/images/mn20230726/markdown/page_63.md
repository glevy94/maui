**CAPTAIN SULLIVAN:** It's in -- in the monitoring, but also one of the efforts that we -- that I was gonna talk about here in just a moment was halfway down the slide under the Adit 3 Remediation Efforts. The first and second bullet talk about the capture zone that we're maintaining within the Red Hill Shaft where we're pulling any contamination that might be in the aquifer towards the pumps so that we can collect them. If you go back to in the months following the release, you know, December all the way through the spring of '22, we recovered several hundred gallons of fuel off of the surface through the skimming operations and everything that was required. We've continued to maintain that capture zone, and we're to the point now where we're pulling about a teaspoon every 30 days off of the surface. So very, very little in quantity, but we are maintaining and pulling any contamination.

But we did start a pilot study in working with all the subject matter experts to -- we developed a pilot study to try to reduce the pumping to the least amount required to maintain that capture zone. So on the 20th of June, we...
