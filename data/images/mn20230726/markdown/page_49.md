especially for communities with at-risk populations such as our keiki.

So all of that data is posted online, and it continues to be shared. We continue to see that the water remains safe to drink. We have not had a detection of JP5, of jet fuel, since we began the long-term monitoring program, and we continue to look at those results. If we identify any concern, such as an exceedance like lead, it is immediately dealt with. The family is provided bottled water, or the school or whatever of that nature, and we do the process to remediate and close out that exceedance.

In addition to long-term monitoring and the monitoring we're doing for total petroleum hydrocarbons or fuel, we have also sampled our Waiawa Shaft, our primary source, which is our sole source right now for the drinking water system, for PFAS to guarantee that we don't have PFAS in our drinking water and to guarantee that's not an area of concern for our drinking water constituents. That result was non-detect. We were able to verify that the drinking water is non-detect for PFAS.

We also continue to make sure we're sharing our data in a variety of avenues. We've created a website called Safe Waters, which is a sharing website that the Navy has utilized to make available the data to all members of our community. So we are able to share the data in.
