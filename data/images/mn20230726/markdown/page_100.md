there's a freshwater or basal lens setting, there's dike-impounded groundwater, there's thickly saturated aquifers, and then there's perched aquifers. I'll talk about the first three, anyway, subsequently. But there's also enigmatic occurrences, and this includes things like the Schofield Aquifer or Schofield high-level groundwater and some of the things that are being discovered on the Big Island that don't really fit into these principal hydrogeologic settings, and we'll talk about that a little bit.

Okay. So the freshwater or basal lens, again, very familiar to you, freshwater floating buoyantly on saltwater in the aquifer. When you take groundwater from that, the consequences of taking groundwater from that is water-table reduction and saltwater rise, and reduction of discharge to the ocean. Where there is cap rock, then the freshwater lens is thicker because the cap rock resists the flow of water to the ocean. The fact is that the freshwater lens gets thicker, but it also causes some of the groundwater discharge to discharge above sea level to springs, such as the Pearl Harbor Springs are a good example. So when you take water from this system, again, you have water table decline and rise of saltwater and encroachment of saltwater, but you also have reduction of discharge to streams that are on land.

In the dike-impounded groundwater system, we have
