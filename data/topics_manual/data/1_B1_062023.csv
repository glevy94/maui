The next item on the agenda is Item B-1, it is the adoption of the Maui Water Development Plan, and if you can put the testifiers into the Zoom room and we'll call you when we're ready to take public testimony. Thank you, Katie.  
So we'll take a staff presentation. Thank you.  
Morning, Chair and   
Good morning.  
Commissioners. Katie Roth, Planning Branch of the commission. Item B-1 is the adoption of the Maui Island Water Use Development Plan for incorporation in the Hawaiʻi Water Plan. You may remember a few months ago, back in March, staff gave an overview of the (inaudible) submittal and the plan itself, so in the interest of time, I'm not going to go into the details that were presented then. That is available; that recording is available on the website.  Those that  that presentation included an overview of some of the major themes and concerns that were raised during public testimony as well as staff's recommendations and responses to those concerns. The submittal you have before you includes the same items. That begins on page 7, and then the staff recommendation on page 11 includes the underlying items that you'll see. I wanted to highlight that after the March 21st presentation, there was additional outreach done by staff with DWS, Maui County, and members of the Haiku community. That was in response to certain items and themes that were identified. We really wanted to make sure that we addressed them sufficiently so that we could come to you today with recommendations and an item that you felt comfortable approving, knowing that we had done our due diligence and additional outreach. So some of the recommendations you see have been tweaked slightly based on those conversations with certain stakeholders and the county. I guess at this time, I would just say that staff believes that the plan itself meets all the statutory requirements set forth in the State Water Code, and it sufficiently addresses the recommended elements in the Hawai‘i Water Plan framework pertaining to updates of the County Water Use and Development Plan. So we feel that the plan you see today is sufficient and meets every  all of the requirements needed to be approved.
I will reiterate the recommendation, so we have that on record. Staff recommends that the commission adopt the Maui Water Use and Development Plan for incorporation into the Hawai‘i Water Plan. Commission staff will also commit to work with the County of Maui on the following 1. Maui DWS will hire a consultant to write a Maui Island Water Use and Development Plan summary document of the plan for public consumption. The summary document should clearly articulate what charts, figures, tables, and data have been amended and, when relevant, provide links to the updated data source. 2. Commission and Maui DWS will incorporate the findings of the USGS Study on Climate Change Impacts on Groundwater Recharge into water planning documents, including the Maui Island Water Use and Development Plan and updated sustainable yields. 3. Maui DWS will organize meetings annually with the Kahikinui, Hana, Koolau, Central, Lahaina, and Wailuku Aquifer Sectors stakeholder groups to better quantify the water needs of residents, including traditional kuleana users, rural residents, and small farmers. Feedback and data from these meetings will be incorporated into a future update of the Maui Island Water Use and Development Plan. Maui DWS will report back  4. Maui DWS will report back to the commission within one year with an update on the status of the USGS hydrological study of the Haiku Aquifer. And 5. Commission staff will continue to work with Maui DWS to support development of their water conservation programs, including water loss control components that implement the findings of completed annual water audits.
I'd also like to mention that we have Council Member Shane Sinenci on the line along with Eva Blumenstein for DWS, and I believe Director Stufflebean is also in attendance virtually if you have additional questions.
Thank you.
And with that, I will be available for any questions you have.
Commissioners, do you have any questions for staff?
Maybe a quick recommendation on your Recommendation 3 is all-encompassing; you might want to at least recognize this soon-to-be-formed East Maui Water Authority or something just to  just to make sure that we're aware of what's going on 'cause that probably includes three or four of these annual meetings.
Yes, absolutely. And that was something that was discussed during public testimony and in conversations with the County.
I have a question on Recommendation 5, which focused on working with Maui DWS to support development of [fair] their water conservation programs. And given Maui DWS is, like, one of several providers, you know, how  is there a  when you say their water conservation programs, that is limited to Maui DWS. [This may be] Is there [broadened] broader [to] support for island-wide conservation.
Yes, absolutely. So the water audits themselves include more than just the DWS systems, but I think that's some good feedback. (Inaudible) is only referring to Maui DWS. So if that's something you want to amend 
Yeah.
we can definitely do that.
Okay.
I will say that the  the water audits, especially in the Lahaina area, are being used as part of our assessment of the water use permit applications that we've been receiving 
Right.
(Inaudible), so we're trying to understand where efficiencies can be made not just in the public, but in the private systems as well.
Any other questions?
Yes. Katie, the submittal is really clear that this fulfills a statutory obligation that we have to have a plan. How does this strengthen our water management? These will be the County of Maui.
That's a good question. So these plans themselves, obviously, as you know, are often imperfect. It takes many years to write them, so they're never going to be perfect (inaudible). That's why we try to approach them as living documents where they can be refined and updated as needed. I'd probably refer to  to the county and their implementation plan for specifics on how this will be used to move Maui County forward in terms of their water development and water resource protection initiatives, but that's also part of the exhibits that needs to be  that needs to (inaudible). I think one of the important points to keep in mind is that this plan was developed in accordance with the old Hawaiʻi Water Plan framework from 2000, and we are in the process of updating that framework. And so we hope to consider a lot of other issues, cultural issues that aren't specifically maybe brought out or explicit in the existing plans that you see coming before you, but it's something thatto incorporate into future updates as it's a huge component that is often missing from these plans.
Thank you. And I'll wait to hear more from Maui, Maui officials. Thank you.
Okay. Oh, go ahead, Joanna.
For Item 1, is there a due date for that summary?
So it's in process now, but I can let Eva comment more specifically on where they're at, but I believe it's in process, and they should have it done in six to nine months.
Okay, thank you.
My question  my only question is, what is the impact if we don't approve this plan?
That's a good question. Well, it's already being used by the county for a lot of their capital improvement projects and planning efforts. So if we do not approve it, I believe they're still going to use it in some way to guide their process and what  and what they hope to achieve with water resource protection on the island. Again, defer it probably to the county to provide more specific information about how not approving at this time would impact the outcome. I know that they've worked very hard many years 
Yes
to get to this point. I know that it's been a long process, and not all the parties have been satisfied. Unfortunately, I think that's just how it goes sometimes when you do outreach over many, many years. But yeah, I think the county might be able to comment a bit more about what impacts specifically not adopting the plan would have.
Okay, awesome. If there are no other questions, I'm going to invite the county to provide us comments.
Very diplomatic.  (Laughter.)  
Council Member Shane Sinenci, would you like to speak first?
Okay. Aloha kākou and aloha, Chair Chang.
Aloha.  
I'm happy to be  aloha nō. I'm happy to be here in support of the commission's recommendations. We are supportive of the commission creating a summary of the report, and also we support having regular updates made to the plan, including the Board of Water Supply and the council's input. This will be important for community outreach and  and just general awareness. We've heard loud and clear from the community that they want to see up-to-date information data within the plan, and I'm supportive of having the Department of Water Supply update those numbers over time. So again, we just wanted to express our mahalo for your consideration of this plan. As Katie said, it has been a monumental task over the last couple of years, and many stakeholders were involved in the process, and so  and again, mahalo for coming to our communities and hearing their concerns. Thank you.
Council Member.   Commissioners, do you have any questions for Shane?  Shane, I just had a clarification. In what you  your comments this morning was that the commission will provide a summary. Is that  that's the Maui  it's not  you're not looking at the  Water Commission staff to do the summary, right?  
Yeah, we're  correct. We're just supportive of the commission's recommendations.  
Okay, okay, okay. Very good, very good. Thank you.  No other questions?  (No response.)  
I have Director John Stufflebean, Maui County Department of Water Supply.  
Aloha.  
Aloha.
Nice to meet you all virtually. Again, John Stufflebean. I've been the director since January, so I'm  I'm new here. And I understand that there were many concerns and opposing testimonies in adopting the plan, and I believe that the commission deputy and his staff have worked diligently with  with both the Department of Water Supply county staff and community members to address these concerns. So, you know, I've read through the plan, and I found that it reflects many of  kind of the department goals and is guiding us in the right direction. And it  it spells out strategies that both diversify our water supply, work towards solutions and work closer with other water purveyors  there are several other water purveyors on Maui  and with other county agencies to consider all the resources. And I want to just kind of briefly go through a few of the things that we're working on now that  that kind of came out of the plan that are, you know, basically implementing the plan. As was said earlier, even though it hasn't been adopted, we're using it. You know, it's  it's a very valuable plan in that it just  it utilized so much input from the community and other sources, so  So, first of all, in terms of watershed protection, we are  we are  for years, we've been doing grant funding to  to fund non-profits to do watershed protection. We're looking at increasing that in the future. Maybe that's  that might even be the most important thing that we're doing to protect the source, so that will continue. We're also protecting our water from contamination. We have a bill that's just been introduced to county council to establish wellhead protection in overlay districts so that there's less risk of well contamination, you know, in the area of the wellheads. We've got a lot going on in water conservation. We  we're retrofitting all of our meters with Smart Meters. Smart Meters allow the meters to be read remotely, which has a couple of advantages. One is the meter reader doesn't have to physically go to the meter, but the other advantage is it provides real-time information on water use. And back in my  I came from California. My career back there, we did a study in one of the cities I was in, and the Smart Meters decreased water use 15 percent  we did a pilot study  because people can get real information on how much water they're using and it also detects leaks. So if  like, if the meter is running 24 hours non-stop, you get a note, hey, you may have a leak, so it really helps with water conservation. We're also  have landscape incentives and guidelines as well as requirements. And we're working out a water conservation bill to introduce to the  to the county council and our water board that will  it will beef up our water conservation requirements.And a big one is our tiered structure. As the other islands do, we have a tiered structure, and council has just approved a revision to our tier structure where we increase the upper tier a lot. And so basically, you know, the  the lifeline water rate didn't change much, but the top tier, we increased 24 percent. So that's  that was found to be maybe one of the most important things you can do. You know, money talks, right? So to  you know, to  to encourage people to  to reduce water use, especially those that are using a lot. We also implemented  council will be  has approved a new rate for hotels and resorts that's a higher rate so that they pay more for the water. And we do have some gray water initiatives going as well. We've got one going in one of our parks and getting ready to put in another one. So we see those as templates to help, you know, increase gray water use throughout the county. We also have some strategies that deal with climate change. We're supporting the collaborative hydrological efforts studies of impacts of climate change and future well development on groundwater health. And we have an ongoing study with USGS to  to assess the effects of scenario-based recharge change on groundwater in the Maui aquifers as demand. increases. And we're adding stream gauges and monitoring wells and other tools to assess what's happening with climate change. In terms of source, we are  for our central system  you probably know Maui has 12 separate water systems, which is so interesting 'cause I'm fairly new here. On our central system, we're exploring new basal well development in the southern portion of the Waihee Aquifer and East  East Maui well development as well. And we're currently conducting a feasibility study to be followed by USGS assessment on the interaction between the groundwater and surface water and potential impacts from pumping the Haiku Aquifer. For Upcountry, we're exploring new well development in the Makawao Aquifer and the Haiku to meet demand on the Upcountry meter priority list. And we're assessing the new raw water reservoirs to increase reliable supply with consideration adopted to other in-stream flow standards. And we're also considering alternative structures and processes to expedite the issuing of meters. And that's a whole 'nother meeting. I won't get into the meter list, but we're looking at about four or five different strategies to help us  to help us address that meter list in a more efficient way. And on the west side over at Lahaina-Kapalua area, Kaanapali, we're pursuing new wells and also working with Maui Land and Pine and Hawai‘i Water Services to integrate  you know, to look at how we can integrate our systems better to most efficiently utilize the water in the area. And then, finally, to address drought and system resiliency, we're formalizing demand response plans and mutual agreements with the private water purveyors to address water shortages. It was said earlier when  we can declare a water shortage, but it's really helpful if all the other water companies on the island also declare a water shortage. So we're looking  you know, we see that as a really important element. We're developing wells to improve reliability as a  as a contingency in areas that are dependent on surface water. The wells are  you know, tend not to respond as quickly to  obviously, rainfall events. And then we're looking to  you know, three of  three of our main water supplies in three of our main areas are the ditch systems, and so we'll continue relying on those, so we're exploring how we invest in those systems to make sure that they're  they're adequately maintained. And we're assessing the Wailuku Water Company system and potentially other legacy systems as well. So, in summary, the plan serves us as a long-term guide; that's the value of it. It provides us a framework in which to  to plan our efforts, and I believe it's a good foundation that we can update. Obviously, that's mentioned. many times. We need to update this regularly and  and we'll work with the community and commission staff to do that in each sector. And we're also  just as a reminder we're tackling the Molokai Water Use and Development Plan, and we also have funding for the Lanai Plan coming up in this fiscal year. So mahalo for your attention. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Director.  Any questions?  
Yes, Director. So congratulations on your  your new post. We welcome you to this role of public service, and we thank you for your testimony. We're particularly grateful that the county is taking upon itself to kind of invest in watershed protection and in those transmission systems, those ancient transmission systems which are really  really undermining the prudent use of a very valuable resource. My question is, you've got different bodies there. You've got the administration's water management team, you've got boards, and then you've got a new board for  coming, that's coming up on the scene. Will the plan help in put  giving them one page to work off of and kind of get everybody on the same page? And you might have a different role in that, but we're all working for the same set of objectives. Is this  is this plan kind of a navigational star in that
That's an excellent point.  Yeah, there are many players involved in the water world, and, you know, really, partnerships are essential to making progress in water and, again, to making sure that everyone's kind of heading true north together. And so, yes, absolutely, this plan  this plan will help guide all of us to make sure we're all headed the same direction and  and making progress towards a better future. That's a really good point. Thank you.
That's it. Thank you.
Any other questions? Mike.
Yeah, a comment. Again, congratulations on your new post, and I echo Commissioner Hannahs's comments. Maui County was the first county that established a watershed partnership and the first county that (inaudible), so I  I definitely encourage that. Just really curious. Briefly, you came from California; you guys don't lack for water issues. What's it like coming to Hawai‘i? Are there things that you brought that can help, or are we out in front, or are we way behind?
I wouldn't say you're in front or behind. It's different, for sure. I mean, there are  there are certainly some  you know, many of the kind of skills and knowledge I developed in California that are veryhelpful here. They're very  a lot of similarities. But for sure, there are unique situations on the islands and on Maui, especially, which I'm having a fascinating time learning because, you know, I  well, I've never seen that one before. I've  you know, I've certainly had many of those moments, you know. So I  you know, I bring in, you know, 40-plus years of water experience in California and Arizona. And actually, in Missouri as well, but that isn't quite as relevant because they have lots of water there. But, you know, certainly it helps and, you know, and there's certain basic principles that  that I bring with me. For example, the value of partnerships which we just talked about. In California, there's 400 water and wastewater agencies, you know, that have to work together and, you know, not to mention the state and the federal and cities and counties and so on. And then also kind of the  the need to have  and I'll just say one more thing, the need to have what we call a diversified water portfolio where, you know, you need to have multiple sources of water and be  have a resilient redundant system. And so we're working on that both in terms of the sources and then also in terms of the  the transmission and delivery systems to make sure they're, you know, robust and redundant and can handle the  you know, the things that always happen to disrupt the system.
All right. So thanks very much.
Any other questions? I  I have one. John, this plan  undoubtedly, there were challenges with communities, so  but it seems like, you know, Council Member Sinenci did a lot of good work in reaching out, as did the rest of the commission. How are you proposing to engage  continue to engage the community in this ongoing dialogue on water?
Well, sure, I mean, very actively and  you know, and, you know, Eva  Eva leads that effort, and I think a lot of good work has been done and  and Shane has been also great in this, from my understanding. You know, I believe there's a  certainly the  we need to engage with the community in many ways, robustly, often, and listen to the community. You know, we can't always do exactly what the community wants, you know, sometimes you have to say, Well, that's not exactly what we can do, but  but absolutely, we need to listen. And so, you know, it's  I go out in the community, I've been to hundreds and hundreds of community meetings in my career. And, you know, we had just one  we had a couple up in recently Upcountry, and it was extreme. It was 300 people at the Kula Community Center. And, you know, listening to their concerns, they bring a lot of valuable information which we need to hear, and we need to understand it, and we need to consider that as we make our decisions. So I'm a strong advocate of community participation and will continue to do that, very actively be involved with that. And then, you know, Eva will help me with how that's done here in Hawai‘i, which is  there's a lot to it here, for sure.
I'm encouraged by your comments. Thank you very much. Any other comments?
Chair, may I ask?
Sure. Yes, please.
Thank you, Chair. Hi, John. Thank you for the presentation. The action list that you just described, how and when would that be embedded in the water use plan that's before us today?
I think it's in there. I mean, almost everything  I believe everything I said has a direct link to the plan. So I didn't  I didn't quote the sections, but, you know, essentially everything that we're doing has a link back to the plan.
So, is there a quantitative measure of what your targets are for reuse and reduction that's part of the plan and as it's tied into your general development plan for Maui as well as community development plans? Because at some point, you know, these uses will come before us for us to approve, and I guess it'd be helpful if we had some assurances that  that the allocations are based on lans that you've just described.
Right, yeah, that is the case. I'll probably  I think I will defer to Eva for that in terms of the  the quantitative connection to the plan because she's much more familiar with it than I am, having worked on it for  for many years. So, Eva, I'll let you  let you tackle that one if you don't mind.
Go ahead. Eva, go ahead.
Mahalo, Chair. Yeah, in response to the commissioner's question, yes, there are quantified targets for each strategy, in fact, that relates to resource use. So in terms of recycled water, you  you have the demand and supply projected through year 2035, so in terms of targeting buildout of R1 or other recycled water use, or whether it's groundwater development or conservation targets, you have those quantified, you know, in five-year increments. And then the strategies kind of have the short- to long-term implementation range. Some of these projects will be, you know, further scoped out over a very long time, and some of them, like the director mentioned, are already in the works. So, yeah, so there are targets in there that we are working through tracking in the implementation matrix so we can report progress to our board and council and to you folks.
And I'll only add to that (Laughter.)
Does that also  those targets apply to the other purveyors other than the Board of Water Supply, or these action items  basically, you control all of those a hundred percent? As we go into the different regions, how are those going to be managed, under whose auspices?
That's a really good question. I mean, this is one of the challenges, right, with having the county developing a water use development plan that applies to private water purveyors and other users. So in terms of the county agencies investing in recycled water expansion, stormwater use, etc., you know, the plan does that, so it's  that  this is also the driver or the guidance for capital improvement program and budget priorities for other agencies that, you know, recycle water falls under the Department of Environmental Management, etc. For private purveyors, you know, there's subtle incentives in the plans, and there are other  there are tools that on the county level can be  we can implement strategies through land use controls or land use approvals. So if this is, say, in a new development, the strategy in the water use development plan is to use x resource, and that project comes in for land use approvals, and we ask the planning commission to  look at that as a guidance, and we put those comments in already in discretion of permit review. But yeah, we don't  obviously, we don't have the authority to impose conservation or allocations on the private providers. That's, you know 
Yeah, I think that's a good model to be actively commenting on land use issues. Good. Thank you.
Any other  yeah.
Yes, I have a comment. Thanks, Eva. I think one thing that  I'm excited to hear what Director Stufflebean said. You know, I mean, one thing, it sounds like Maui DWS can do a  sort of set the pace and set an example with, say, Smart Metering and kind of setting new standards for monitoring uses and  and conservation. I know it's not in the plan, but it would be exciting to see  you know, as you guys get more data and more real-time data, to be able to have dashboards or something and  and it doesn't need to be put in the plan, but just to have that in mind as to where things  where you folks maybe can take it. I think Maui is really setting  has the opportunity to set new models for the rest of the islands given the whole array of challenges and opportunities, so  Yeah, thanks for articulating that, I guess, and  us kind of listen and see where some of those gaps are too. You know, because if you guys set  set an example, then maybe the  it allows us as a commission to then point out to the other private purveyors like, Hey, look, it's doable, and we should all be doing this in terms of conservation and kind of innovating. So, kind of appreciate the work that's been put in to take in that feedback and  and be more responsive.
Great comment. Thank you.  Any other questions?   Eva, did you want to  did you want to add anything more to the discussion? Because   
Well, thank you, Chair. Well, I just want to really say we really appreciate the  both the commission staff and the deputy that they  you know, they're taking the time to scrutinize the plan and to further engage with the community members, you know, after this went through council here on our end. So, yeah, I just want to assure you, you know, every voice that came forward was heard and considered to craft these strategies, and we think that the  the proposed conditions in the staff's submittal, you know, we can do that, that can be implemented, and that would allow the plan, you know, to go forward. Oh, I want to respond also to Commissioner Hannah's question  or was it the Chair's question on what happens ithe plan is not approved. So as Director Stufflebean  you know, he gave a couple of examples of how we already lean on the plan. We're using it as the guidance for capital improvement programs and budget priorities. You know, it was adopted by ordinance. But, of course, the plan has a dual function. It should be a guidance document for the commission as well, so  so I think that is  you know, for us, if it was not approved, the next update will go through the whole process again with community engagement, going to our board, public hearings, new council review and approval. But if it's not approved by the commission, of course, it's not incorporated into the Hawai‘i Water Plan, so you  you don't have a tool, you know, to serve that purpose. I think that would be the real downside, you know. There's a lot of valuable guidance in there, we believe, for the  for the commission as well. So yes, I mean, we feel this is already  we're gonna continue scoping out project strategies in the plan so there will be even more opportunity for community participation there over the time, so  even revisiting demand and supply as we're scoping out this project. So it's a living document. And I just want to mahalo everyone that put so much effort into the process.
All right. So I do have a quick question on the living nature of the document. Right now, it's a PDF posted to the county website, and as itJune  gets updated, I noticed some sections had the draft watermark. Does that mean the  the document itself will be versioned, or is it going to be  I want to understand how the public is going to access the living document as it gets updated. Just the technical details, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. So the PDF document that now has the links to come from the table of content, we have the draft watermark removed, of course, then I think you have the tracking  the matrix of  you know, the summary of the implementation of the strategies and, you know, a tracking sheet. So we will have that available to the public as well, so that's something that gets shared with our land use planning departments, our board, and council as needed so we can kind of just track and see how that evolves over time. Then in further updates of the plan, I'm pretty sure we're not going to tackle the island as a whole again. It could be by aquifer sector or by, you know, watershed or moku or whatnot, so that way, it's a little more manageable. I mean, it's still, you know, a year-long process, but  so I see that as the updates are done, you know, it would be focused on  on a particular aquifer sector and the same thing, just posted, you know, for  for public review as we go through that process.
I have a simple suggestion. Actually, I started doing it. You can create a navigation pane in PDF, so a senior version, because it allows you to navigate from page 1300 back to the TOC back to  you know, and jump around sections. So I think that would ease access and review and feedback and maybe ameliorate any kind of frustrations. So, thank you.
No, thank you. That was very helpful.
Chair, quickly.
Go ahead.
Eva, what's the status of the Molokai and Lanai Water Use Development Plans?
Mahalo, Commissioner. We have the consultant, Townscape, halfway through, a little more than halfway through, updating the Molokai Water Use and Development Plan. A lot of the community engagement is completed, demand projections are done, and we're now vetting resource options or presenting resource options to the community. So they have still a ways to go. We put in  we had funding approved for this next fiscal year, FY '24, to commission a consultant to help us update the Lanai Water Use and Development Plan. So, you know, it's a multi-year process, but thinking, you know, we'll contract towards the end of this year to begin that process.
So what  where do you view the horizon for these plans that you'll have something that  to present?
So for  for Molokai, I'd say earliest March 2024 to be  a draft plan to be presented to our board. We will brief the commission at the same time. The board has 180 days to review and provide their comments before we present a bill for an ordinance to our county council. This Maui plan took three years through county council, so I'm not guaranteeing how long that's gonna take.  (Laughter.)  
You know, as soon as that's been adopted, then it'd be presented to the commission. And for Lanai, I would say, you know, a minimum of three years as well.  
And I will also mention that the Molokai Plan will be  there will be a briefing (inaudible) group that are the consultants to the commission.  
Okay.  
So we are going to organize that.  
Great, that's great. Super, thank you.  
There  just to add, there's going to be a bunch of planning components of the Hawai‘i  parts of the Hawai‘i Water Plan coming to the commission. Oahu, we have a couple that the board wants to present on as well. We're trying not to have more than one per meeting because it's so thick and it's robust, and it is a planning document so it's just trying to manage the agendas, but they're coming. You will  you will see a bunch of these planning documents coming in the near future.
Very good.Any other questions?(No response.)
Eva, this is a rather large document. Is it nimble enough? 'Cause you say it's a  it's a living document, but I'm assuming you also use  utilize the adaptive management approach that  as things change. Do you feel that the document and the process is nimble enough that as you get information, you can make appropriate  whether it's changes or updates? And how does that work out as a practical matter?
Thank you, Chair. I appreciate that. And I think we're still figuring out, you know, for the different kind of strategies, how we apply them, but in general, I mean, we use it frequently because, I mean, this is  since it was adopted by council, it kind of gives us the justification to, you know, whether it's investing in water resource protection or, you know, well-head protection or funding projects, so  so as a tool, it is useful, you know. We have  we have the implementation matrix to refer to. But in terms of updating data for  I mean, for example, we have  we're looking at feasibility studies to assess resources in different aquifer systems right now, and part of that process, we have a consultant kind of vet or revisit the demand and supply projections to see, are they still valid? You know, they were done  they're five years old and whatnot. Then, you know, turns out they're fairly valid, but for Central  so, for example, we had projected we need another 8 million gallons a day by year 2035; turns out we need 11 mgd by year 2040. So it's  it's a living document in that it's constantly  you know, we track private purveyors' water use, those that report, and we track our own water use, obviously, and kind of adjust those projections as we go and as projects are scoped out.
No, thank you, that's very helpful. I mean, I think it is helpful to have a document that can be sort of the central location of current information, you know, a framework for planning, but it is helpful to have the document that is, you know, constantly updated and reflects real-time, but it is something  a document that it's not  it can be a guiding document for more than just government or the county, but others as well, so that's good.
