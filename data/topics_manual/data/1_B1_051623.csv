Approval of Stream Diversion Works Permit Application (SDWP.5990.6) and Special Conditions, East Maui Irrigation Company, LLC, Modification of Diversion Nos. 215, 185, 308, 196, 194 to Fix Leaks and Provide Habitat Connectivity; Hoʻolawa, Kailua, ʻOʻopuola, and Kaʻaiea Streams, Maui; Tax Map Key(s): (2) 1-1-001:042; 2-9-014:035; and 2-9-014:007; and
Declare that Project is Exempt from Environmental Assessment Requirements under Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 343, and Hawaii Administrative Rules Chapter 11-200.1
Mr. Uyeno read the summary of request as submitted and stated that staff stands on its submittal. Mr. Uyeno then read the staff’s recommendations.
When was the letter to SHPD sent?
once we receive the application, deem that it's complete, we will forward an acknowledgment letter to the applicant stating that the application has been received and that initiates the review process by the agencies along with that we send a letter back to the applicant regarding our findings on the SHPD finding that no historic sites would be impacted. That letter went out on March 3rd, 2023.
Are they the only agency that did not submit a response?
starting on page 9. When we send that acknowledgment letter that also initiates the agency review processes. All the agencies that are listed there also received letters notifying them of the availability of the application on our website. No comments were received from DHHL, Division of Forestry and Wildlife, Land Division, State Parks, Office Hawaiian Affairs, and Army Corps of Engineers, and no public comments were received.
SHPD is required to provide a concurrence.
Yes, typically because of their backlog in responding we will receive their comments after the fact or concurrence after the commission’s decision.
This is almost 2 months to 10 weeks, that’s a long time. I would like them to be more timely because others are waiting for responses.
I believe they have been getting better. They switched over to a new system. Both agencies and the general public has been getting accustomed on how to use it I think the response times have been gradually increasing
that is my sense to ask that one week before our meetings if we do not receive a response or a concurrence letter from SHPD. Could you please send them a reminder and ask them if they could please appear at our commission meeting to explain to us why they haven't provided a timely response.
thank you, Dean, there are some substantial comments from the Sierra Club. Do you care to address any of those now or wait till after their presentation?
wait till after their presentation.
on page two of the submittal, gallons per day versus million gallons per day bottom of the page. And then on page three. Is there also precipitation for the Ka‘aiea stream? And the last one is the Clean Water Branch does have updated standard comments and maybe in the future can refer to that one. We're looking at the possibility of a water quality certification requirement for these diversions and work in streams.
and if I'm not mistaken that is subject to Army Corps?
I believe EMI can answer that better. Whether in that process of getting determination from the Army Corps.
Representing EMI, the applicant for items B1 and B2 seeking approval of stream diversion works permit for compliance with the Huelo Stream interim in-stream flow standards. EMI understands the importance of the Commission’s decision and has complied with all permit application deadlines. The initial 13 priority permit applications are under staff review, and there are 14 additional modifications not covered in the current hearing. EMI’s written testimony addresses major policy issues, including the recommendation for the complete removal of some diversions. EMI argues that permanent removal is unnecessary since interim in-stream flow standards can change in the future. EMI agrees to abandon the use of diversions but opposes the permanent removal of structures, citing unnecessary environmental impacts and potential future reinstatements. EMI believes the policy of removing diversion structures should be applied on a case- by-case basis and limited to permanent abandonments. The environmental costs of removal, identification of alternatives, and impact on the water system’s structural integrity should be assessed. EMI suggests a non-uniform policy for every interim in-stream flow standard decision across the state. The permits, if approved, are subject to further reviews and potential conditions from other regulatory agencies. Additional studies and permitting requirements from county, state, and federal agencies could impact and delay the timeline. EMI appreciates the opportunity to comment and is available for questions from the Commission.
so, are you suggesting that the removal of the stream diversions triggers a Chapter 343 review?
The necessity of permanent removal of the diversion depends on the decision of the commission. Suggests that permanent removal is not required to comply with the IIFS. Future changes are unpredictable, as exemplified by the repair of the damaged Kohala ditch and potential modifications to water usage standards. The legislature has appropriated a large sum of money to try to repair the ditch. The University of Hawai’i’s initiative to advance local food production emphasizes the importance of water resources for both domestic and agricultural purposes. Caution is advised to the commission, emphasizing understanding and compliance with the established IIFS, but questioning the need for permanent removal of the diversion to meet those standards.
this is more a comment from the actual words from our East Maui decision. Our decision will necessitate significant reductions in off-stream diversions in many streams. We are recommending no diversions of either base or total flow. Our order specifically identifies the desired streamflow expected. We recognize that a universal remedy to modify or remove diversions is not practical at this time. The commission’s overall guidance is not to remove diversion instructions if modifications from achieved desired results. I just want to provide that for context for subsequent discussions.
as I look at the photos in the submittal, I'm looking at some infrastructure that may not last forever and if we don't remove them now do they continue to deteriorate? Ultimately, the use for which you're holding them at some unknown future date; they're really not prepared to meet those needs, so I guess Ken what I'm looking for is what's your rating of the life of this infrastructure? I mean it's served us well for a century how much more do you think it's going to last?
it just depends, some by age and some by condition. I wouldn't say that there's a rating scale that we have but in working with the staff of the Water Commission for example, there was a diversion where the staff recommended removing all pipes but not demolishing the dam or the embankment. To be frank we're a little bit surprised seeing the submittal that it kind of changed. I think further discussion is necessary. Certain things like removal of pipes would do less damage than going there with heavy equipment and trying to hammer out that embankment where water can flow over it now.
in terms of your surprise Ken. Isn't it fairly standard in leases that the improvements that you put upon the land during the term of your use have to be removed when you return it?
it depends. I'm not an expert on the land side but in DLNR I've seen where the land division has that option. If the lessee does not want to remove the improvements, sometimes they value their improvements and would like to keep it.
Commissioner Hannahs Dean, I surmised that this is not the first time this discussion is occurring and that their feeling is that these have no use of future value for us.
it's hard to say right again, as they did note in their comments that this is an interim in stream flow standard. Understandably I think we went through the same thing in the East Maui contested case hearing; whereas commissioner Buck noted should these diversions be removed or not. I think there may have been an oversight on our part being that one submittal was for modification and one submittal was for diversion and noting Division of aquatic resources comments about the two diversions.
Let’s take them one at a time. The first item is specifically about modifications. So, in those recommendations, there is no recommendation for complete removal unless I'm missing it. What his testimony is referring to is item number two and maybe we should address B2 when we get there. Because it's co-mingling the issues. Before you are recommendations to modify which doesn't say the removal of the diversion it just says to modify to meet the IIFS. I think that would be helpful if we just take them item by item because the issues that are raised in Akinaka or EMI’s testimony is more reflected in item B2.
You would agree Ken?
yes, and thank you for clarifying Kaleo.
David Frankel representing the Sierra Club and submitted written testimony. Concerned about not receiving information in a timely manner. Requesting the timeline for system modifications from EMI, which is not posted on the CWRM’s website. Requesting notification to residents prior to impounding streams for their safety. Objecting to the proposed berms and lips as aesthetically unappealing and potentially ineffective during high rainfall. Supporting Dr. Strauch’s proposal from the November testimony and expressing alarm at EMI’s change in course. Raising concerns about the Ho‘olawa stream diversion and the need for a permit before installing a new sluice gate. Highlighting the drowning hazard near the concrete dam and advocating for its removal to create a safer channel. Noting that provided photos do not show the quantity of leftover pipes and debris that need removal. Expressing the need for these issues to be discussed in quarterly meetings to address them before reaching the commission.
I’m sorry, I’d just like to note for the record. I just realized that the EMI written testimony was mislabeled. B2 should be B1 and B1 should be B2. I apologize.
question please for EMI. It sounds like EMI is ready to proceed with this work immediately and I saw in the submittals that it was an estimate of about six months to have the majority of these things completed. Does that still hold? That sounds pretty quick which is just great because get these interim in-stream flows up and running and have this situation restored. But what is the timing right now assuming there are no further delays?
I would have to defer to the EMI folks, and I think they're also available but maybe if I could just reiterate it kind of depends on what the decision is and what kind of permitting is necessary. As we know a lot of times permitting is the thing that takes quite a while. But the actual work may not be that long. We have Mark Vaught also on the call so he could answer that question.
I think the timeline for executing the construction of this would be six months to a year. I think that was what we had originally put down, but you know permitting time and weather is always the toss-up just depending on how soon you can get permits and weather permitting. Again, I think it's important to note that those are obstructions to the construction.
I guess it’s good we are heading into a drier season at this point.
I have a question for Dr. Strauch or stream protection and management. It's a lot of technical information. I was wondering about a couple of things given the testimony from the Sierra Club and some of the comments from East Maui. When is the next meeting? It sounds like this was not brought up in the existing structures for dialogue. I've seen the diversions for three minutes and we don't want to be micromanaging it from Honolulu. So, what happened at the last meeting and when is the next opportunity for hashing out some of these understandings?
I apologize for not providing the exact date of the last meeting. Since it was our first meeting after the responsibility of hosting quarterly meetings was transferred from the Land Division to the commission, the focus was on understanding the participating agencies and the general public. On March 3rd, we sent an acknowledgment letter to East Maui Irrigation Company regarding their two diversions. Two weeks later, during the East Maui company meeting, we mentioned that the applications were available on our website, but we didn’t specifically discuss the nature of the applications. The meeting was more of an orientation and an opportunity to get to know each other. I apologize for any oversight in not addressing the application details at that time.
so, when is the next one?
the plan right now is to hold it every three months. So, the next one is on June 16th and if it helps too Ayron does have some photos of each of the diversions and he can kind of walk through each of the proposed modifications for each one.
given the feedback from testimony; it would be helpful to understand how the November decisions are tied to the recommendations, the logical flow, and understanding of the rationales because I think you've given a lot of thought to all of this, and youwe've worked a lot and have spent a lot of time on this, but I think we're not there with you, and the more everybody understands, the more people seefeel themselves in the solution.
if I can, call on Dr. Ayron Strauch to provide some photos and walk through that connection.
also, just to note in the submittal we tried to put the logic there above the diversion, so it shows what was discussed in November in the first box and then the proposed modification to show this is what we meant this is what's being proposed. If there is more cross-walking or further clarification, then let's go through that. Let's take some time to walk through it and make sure you feel comfortable with what's being recommended.
I will do my best to walk through the recommendations, although I apologize for not knowing every detail since I am not the author of the document. Here are the key points.
Recommendation H7 or Division 215 focuses on the Ho‘olawa Stream at Haʻikū ditch. The management goal is to increase flows in the stream for recreational and downstream aquatic habitat purposes. The stream has an estuary that enhances recruitment in the lower reaches. However, there are substantial overhanging bedrock lips following the rejuvenation phase of the Hāna volcanics that flowed downhill. Recommendations have been made to increase the base flow in the Wailoa, New Hāmākua, and Lowry ditches. The base flow should be maintained in the stream beyond the Haʻikū ditch. All the restored upstream flow should remain in the stream for riparian, recreational, and aquatic ecosystem values. To achieve this, the design of the diversion needs to be understood. The intake is on the right bank, and there is a gravel or trash rack in front of it. The stream acts as a gravel trap to keep debris out of the tunnel. There used to be a sluice gate that has been removed for the last five years. Lowering the invert of the dam in the stream and sealing the low-flow openings in the trash rack would ensure that the base flow remains in the stream and continue downstream. The proposed design includes a notch to allow the flow to continue. Releasing water through the sluice gate could pose a potential hazard for people recreating in the pool. If the sluice gate is returned and functions as designed, all the restored slow will continue through the proposed notch and not present a hazard. The dam is built into the bridge structure. The Ho‘olawa captures significant high-flow events, resulting in greater flows in the section, which may continue to be diverted. However, low flows will remain in the stream and pass through the proposed notch. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani on the submittal it should be “construct 45 inch wide or notch?” The submittal seems a little incomplete or I'm not understanding the terminology.
Ayron if you can refer to the submittal page proposed action number four, the yellow hatched lines is what would be cut out of the wall to create that invert. Correct?
yes, so that yellow hatching is the window with which all of the low flows will continue downstream. The lowest point in that window is the invert of the stream if we seal all of the pukas in the trash rack.
got it. It helps to have you walk us through this.
so, Ayron. As submitted having heard the concerns of Earthj Justice and Ken, Akinaka on behalf of EMI. You're satisfied that what we presented here in the submittal is still recommended notwithstanding the concerns that may have been raised.
correct. I believe that in order to retain all of the restored flow in the stream. We need to notch out the dam and allow that flow downstream. This allows EMI to divert some of those higher flows. But obviously, they will never be able to take all the high flows because those high flow events exceed the maximum capacity of intake, so just a small portion of those high flow events will be able to be diverted and all of those low flows will remain in the stream.
and in this case, we are allowing infrastructure to remain in place. Where you are adapting it to our multiple purposes.
I think we should just walk through each of them, so the commissioners know exactly what’s being proposed.
Kaleo, I do appreciate the presentation of the logic. It does refer to the CWRM recommendation, specifically the November one, and what was recommended and how this action is consistent.
we want to make sure that we are in alignment with the parts the commission gave in November. And if we're not, then this is a time to make any modifications or recommendations, so we are consistent with that intent.
The Wailua Ditch intake 15 or diversion 185 is located at Kailua stream. Apologies for not reviewing EMI’s drawings properly, as I was more focused on the language. The proposed drawings do not accurately represent our intentions. The diversion captures all low flows, and the objective is to create a bridge or plate to retain the base flow across the intake. The proposed mechanism includes a metal grate, but filling the gaps with concrete and rebar may also serve the purpose. The primary need is to create a small berm on the upstream side to ensure the continuation of low flows across the bridge. The current depiction of the berm as a large structure is not accurate. My recommendation is to have a minor concrete lip, around two to three inches in height. This design would allow water to flow over the intake downstream. Apologies again for the staff submittal that fails to represent the design accurately. The use of concrete would be minimal and would not negatively affect the visual aesthetics. Properly designed concrete structures can withstand damage over the years, similar to other elements in the stream. The proposed berm would be a small structure, ensuring the uninterrupted flow of low flows across the intake downstream.
before we continue, the proposed modification is a three-inch by 30-inch-wide metal plate. Would you recommend that the berms also be three inches high? We should add that clarification statement, three-inch berms.
as long as it meets the intent of the amount of water flowing downstream. The amount of water that the plate can carry is dependent on how wide the channel is. I'm confident they have the engineers to do the design and as long as the interim instream stream flow standard is met by the design; we can verify that in the field.
Ayron those grates look like they've been there a while. Do they factor into any of our goals or objectives for that stream?
I don’t understand that question.
I get where low flow is going to go through that recruiting system where the low flow will stay in the stream, which is unobjective. But during high flow, those big grates like that pretty much dump into the diversion right.?
a portion of the higher flows can be diverted. Kailua watershed goes up eight thousand feet in maximum elevation on Haleakalā. There are some big storm events that flow through this stream channel and in no way does this intake capture all of those high-flow events, but it will capture those medium-flow events.
I think you've addressed the point that I raised. I didn't quite raise the point as well as I wanted. That doesn't look like best practice; it doesn't look like the kind of stuff we want in our Stream long term. Aren't there better grading systems now that allow water to flow over as well as into diversions? This stuff is just going to break apart over time as it continues to deteriorate. Is this the moment that we see an upgrade or is that irrelevant to the purposes of the action?
the question of whether this current design is going to deteriorate over time. I can defer to EMI in terms of the age which is the longevity of the structure. I don't know when this was last replaced, but I would assume many decades. Maybe EMI can comment on the age at which these structures are at this point.
I apologize but I don't know the exact age of these. They are long before I started, which was roughly 30 years ago. These are 50-plus years old if not more.
so, our recommendation would be to just leave them as is at this point.
the structure outside of the flow channel EMI repairs as needed. We don’t micromanage repairs like this.
so, the feeling is it's a bit of an overreach for our interest. The in-stream flows standard, which is kind of the focus of our action to kind of leverage some improvements. That would make this a more modern system.
I don't know what you mean by modern. This intake in particular has a control mechanism. When the Wailoa ditch flows exceed a certain capacity, it automatically closes a radial gate that discharges the water into the new Hamakua ditch. It’s a pretty cool design.
thank you very much Chair.
The ʻOʻopuola stream at Spreckles ditch. The photograph in the submittal is somewhat misleading, and the concrete lip is positioned on the wrong side. From a downstream view, the right bank is covered in hau bush, with small wing walls and a grate where water drops through. Looking upstream, the goal is to restore flow in both directions. To achieve this, a metal plate or sealant across the intake is envisioned, similar to the Kailua ditch, along with a small berm on the upstream side. The existing wing walls have been there for many decades, and properly designed small concrete structures can endure in this environment. The stream management objective is to enhance aquatic habitat availability downstream, especially downstream of the center ditch and Spreckles ditch.
is there any language that needs to be amended based on your review?
it says construct three inches high by 30-inch-wide concrete metal plate channel across the grate to pass 1.8 CFS. I think the three-inch high refers to the sides not necessarily the height of the plate itself. Maybe that’s an oversight, then install a concrete lip across an upstream- sided diversion. On page six of the submittal, the photograph and location of the lip is not correct.
but the language is correct. It is still upstream where the berm is. And the plate will accomplish the goal of connectivity and habitat restoration.
thank you chair. I have two questions, one for Mark and one for Ken. Mark, could you address some of these safety issues that were raised by the Sierra Club in terms of notification of work? I think Ayron addressed the siphoning effect in the damning of the one diversion, but Mark would you address the safety precautions that will be in place?
I'm sure we can work out some sort of notification with a point of contact. The downstream residents of each particular stream; we've gone over this before. If there's enough water in there impounded that we release it that would put our employees in jeopardy that would put everyone in jeopardy so we don't plan to work in those conditions if the water is that high. I respect the Sierra Club’s mentioning that but I’m just saying that we wouldn't want to put ourselves in jeopardy as well as anyone else so those are precautions we would take.
Okay, thank you, Mark. The second is really a clarification of the intent of the designs of the berms that were mentioned. What is the structural integrity that’s built into these designs? There was engineering to these submittals. You’re planning on having structures withstand a certain flow over a period of time. So, as you went through the engineering specs for the berms and the grates, what were the design criteria that were used?
I wanted to clarify that when we talked with Akinaka about the criteria for the project, one of the things they mentioned was the size of the channel. If the channel is 30 inches high, that’s the entire height of the berm. We don’t want to put anything intrusive in the berm, so it will just be used to channelize the water into a certain location so that it can bypass the intake. Any flows that are consistently higher than that will have access to the grates themselves. Anything at a low flow will be channeled into the bypass channel and run through the link sets. I think the berm is designed to be just the same height as the channel itself.
and that has withstood high flow events over time.
thus far, yes, we've had situations like that. We've used metal in the past and they have. But mother nature changes our minds daily, and she decides today's the day and then today's the day.
Okay, thanks, Mark.
at the next location, which is the same stream ‘O‘opuola but a little bit further downstream at Center ditch, the goal is to continue to retain all of that restored flow at the higher elevations downstream past the ditch. The intake is quite a wide structure and the upstream part of it has some pukas in it. The first step would be to fill in those pukas so that water doesn’t drain into the ditch inadvertently. The next step would be to build a similar channel across the concrete, which is the ditch itself, and over the intake structure. There would be a lip, which is very similar to the previous design. Then, a bridge or a plate would be used to convey the water downstream so that all of the base flows are retained in the stream.
So, Ayron just really quick, similar in the proposed action. If we were clearer to say, install three-inch berms to direct flow in to channel that would make it more explicit about not being these huge walls as maybe the submittal originally depicted via image.
yeah, unfortunately the scale of the design looks like they are quite substantial structures, but they are going to be non-intrusive visually. I don't think relative to the rest of the concrete that's already there.
that's just to make it explicit about what the intent is correct okay. 
and then the last one. I think we have one more on this modification.
At the center ditch, the Ka‘aiea stream runs underneath the ditch. On the left bank, there is a wing wall with a bunch of pukas that are designed to divert all the low flows into the ditch. Higher flows are diverted along the right bank over a little berm into an area with gravel, and then it spills into the ditch. The goal is to ensure that all of the low flows stay in the stream. The design is to notch out the upstream lip, create a channel across the intake, seal up all of the low-flow pukas, notch a section of the downstream wall lip, and then convey all of the low flows from upstream in the intake downstream without them being diverted. The low-flow channel is to be located at or near the lowest elevation intake so that all of the low flows remain in the channel and don’t get diverted.
again, Ken. Ayron’s descriptions are consistent with what you are proposing.
I believe so, Roy worked on a lot of the details with the EMI folks. Roy are you able to answer that question just to make sure that I’m not misspeaking.
Yeah, it’s consistent.
Ayron, it sounds like it's just a flat metal plate that you're looking to put across; and I guess is it going to be a little concave to ensure that the water gets past the grates?. I don't want to micromanage. I'm just trying to visualize what's happening.
any other questions commissioners?
there are basically little walls; that's the three-inch-high reference. We don't want it concave in the sense that it would force all the water to flow into a somewhat narrow channel. Our amphridromous species are good at migrating small rivulets of water. They don't need a big flow, so the more spread out it is actually better for recruitment.
but we don’t have any spilling and over into-. 
the wing walls keep it from spilling into the intake.
sorry I don’t know the terms, if this were to be revised little diagrams that help people who need pictures would be really helpful.
see these little walls?.
okay, that’s the three-inch thing, got it. Sorry, I was thinking the wing walls were part of the ditch.
well, they do exist on the ditch. I just meant the walls on the plate.
mini wing walls okay. If just the simplified diagram so that it's in the record. So that we are all talking about the same thing and understanding and have the same picture in our head that would be really helpful.
So, these images will be amended or appended to the decision that are presented here and will be part of the minutes. So, what we’re discussing hopefully, if recommended and amended; will all be recorded here with the intent. So, if it's not clear then let's make that clear before any action is taken.
any other questions or comments commissioners?
I just want to go back to Ken's concerns. So, with regard to B1, your testimony regarding kind of resisting removing infrastructure doesn't apply. Am I correct Ken, because you're being allowed to leverage a lot of the existing infrastructure just to make a minimal adaptation to solve our purposes. But also have that infrastructure there for your needs as well.
that is correct commissioner Hannahs.
I would like to hear from David Kimo Frankel. Just thoughts and after hearing this discussion. Are there still the same concerns? I understand that the big thing is the notification and the quarterly meetings. But if you can kind of reflect back.
this has been really helpful, and I think in terms of language. What I now understand is that the three-inch berm is essentially three inches higher than the metal plate or concrete. The way it's written in A and B submittal and as well as CWRM submittal is that the metal sheet and concrete would be three inches high which would defeat the purpose of the lip or berm because it has to be lower. Ayron has clarified this, but it would be good if that was more reflective in the decision. I appreciate Mark Vaught saying they never impound the water when they do these fixes. This provides a lot of assurance but it’s not clear if this is always the case. If the commission is on the same page that there will be no impoundment, then that’s great. This should take care of everything.
Mark did you want to clarify that?
just confirming. Mr. Franco is correct; the general idea is not to impound a larger amount of water and then have a sudden release because that jeopardizes not just downstream but our employees as well.
do you anticipate that there may be times when you might have to impound water that would affect downstream?
no, what we generally try to do is create a bypass with some pipes and things so that the water can continue to flow downstream.
that’s excellent.
Mark as I look at this picture on our screen and see those old-style grates. Are you familiar with the Kamehameha school’s Punalu‘u stream diversion,
Ken I’m sure is. They’re more modern aluminum systems that allow flow over as well as flow in and self-cleaning.
Neil we'll continue with your questioning. I also want to note that Kathy Ho with the Department of Health just stepped in as well, but Joanna is going to complete item B1.
I just want to encourage EMI and Akinaka to look at some of the modern technologies available for in-stream diversion. The old grates were very inefficient and kind of greedy in terms of the water they took. And as part of the commission's record on the EMI decision we were encouraging modern investment to kind of make these systems more efficient and modern and safe.
any other questions from the commissioners? Do we have a motion?
I just want to make sure the corrections are incorporated, and they were somewhat really detailed. I mean they're factual sort of language issues in the submittal. I don't think it makes sense to step through all of them so what options do we have?
in taking notes while the discussion was going out while Ayron was presenting the only thing that wasn't consistent was the three-inch berms, the size of the berm was what we wanted to provide clarity on. I would just recommend for diversions w15 and C7 where those berms are being proposed; that we just amend the proposed action to say install three-inch berms.
CI mean in terms of intent of what we're trying to do that's more of an engineering question. I think all the parties understand the purpose of that berm and it's not going to be something that is intrusive. So, I think the language as submitted I think we flushed it out through our discussions with all parties. I don't think it matters if it's three and a half inches or two and a half inches, but that berm would be put in place and serve the purpose of controlling the IIFS.
maybe just to recommend if the modifications do not meet the IIFS obviously the commission set IIFS to be enforced. So, if the modifications as implemented do not sufficiently meet the IIFS based on our own monitoring then we'll come back to the commission and recommend further.
I agree that's a different issue I agree with that.
can I recommend a revision that inclusion or clarification because when people are going to read this document as a public record, they may misinterpret it or interpret it as suggested but that is not the intent. B2 presentation will be attached but making sure that it's connected more meaningfully to the submittal would be helpful to reflect the clarifications that were made today.
and the minutes will reflect the clarifications.
I’m just thinking the public is not going to look at three different documents. They're going to look at one so help me out sorry. I'm not very experienced in this. What would that recommendation for revisions look like?
what I’m hearing from Commissioner Katayama is he wants the staff’s recommendation to reflect the discussion and Kaleo’s clarification. If there is further clarification, we can refer to the minutes. I am concerned that if we are too detailed, it may be assumed that anything we don’t include was intentionally excluded. I think Ken, Roy, and Mark were all given an opportunity to confirm their understanding of Ayrton’s clarification. I'm not sure I want to get into too much detail unless the Commissioners feel otherwise. I understand that this can be modified right Kaleo.
yeah, these are modifications. We're not abandoning it, there's still a relationship between the commission and EMI as a diverter.
I'm also optimistic that there will be more quarterly meetings where the community will have an opportunity to be included in some of these discussions before they get to the commission. so, some of this can be worked out at that level as Dean described the first meeting. It was more of a meet-and-greet introduction setting. Parameters and then as they get into more regular quarterly meetings there will be more specific discussions on proposed changes. Okay Aurora, do you want to make something more specific?
can I make a motion to approve? But there are some factual text errors in this so with the staff correcting and clarifying those proposed actions if reflecting the discussions that had and also including in the recommendations that this will also be presented at the June 165th quarterly meeting but that's up for discussion.
Chair that would be the second motion so either we're going to revise the first motion at the agreement of the person who made it and seconded. Then we can move on or dispense with the first motion and now deal with the second so, you have a motion on the floor.
I had a motion from Commissioner Katayama. I thought it was seconded to approve staff's recommendation, but Aurora are you proposing a new motion?
an amendment that the staff corrects the submittal reflecting the discussion on B1 with the explanations given.
so, Commissioners Hannahs and Katayama do you agree to the amendment? A motion has been made and seconded with amendments all in favor since this is our first motion. oh no we so all in favor say aye. The motion was approved unanimously very good. Shall we move on to item B2?
