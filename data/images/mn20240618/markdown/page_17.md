**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** I’d hate for the last action I take is deferral because it feels like it's kicking a can down the road, but I wonder if you're thinking - it's the right thing to do, we need to do it right. If we deferred floating the idea of should we defer so that number one, Ryan has an opportunity to consult with DHHL. They are a public trust use, beneficial use, they should have an opportunity for meaningful consultation. Secondly, to consider the other ideas and recommendations that were made here today and other feedback that you received that you can add to the recommendations. Third, to really develop a workflow diagram that takes your 700 or 800 applications and kind of runs them through a chart that then shows how many drop off and how much more efficient you get and what you're going to focus on so that the Commission can see it, as Aurora has recommended. And fourth, consult with the AG on the correct legal process for achieving these desired.  

**CHAIR CHANG:** Is that a motion?  

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** Can we have comments on this?  

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Yeah, let's comment.  

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** I guess I'm on the other side of the fence and that issue of whether it's rulemaking, administrator is here, but for me the issue is do we want to impede the process if we pass and adopt what's here today as amended. We can go down the road and fix it and address it as the issues arise and it gives time for further review, but it gives at least an authority to move and address these issues as presented and as discussed in a lot of detail. When I first read this document, that's where it sort of came out - is it right for adoption? But again the alternative is to do nothing and again have this issue keep rolling down the road. I guess I'm in the camp right now is that approve it with this issue. We can address it at subsequent meetings to correct it.  

**COMMISSIONER HO:** I have a comment about that. I'm sort of on the other side of that, I'd like to get the legal question addressed first because if we're doing something that is illegal rulemaking or whatever, that our actions that we take is subject for dissolution and so I'd rather defer and seek the counsel of our…  

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** Is there sort of clear areas or gray areas where we are looking at in the recommendations where it is rulemaking?  

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** Can I get in on this? That was a question for me too which is, what are we talking about possible rulemaking? Is it the delegation for the individual…  

**COMMISSIONER HO:** For me it was the exceptions.
