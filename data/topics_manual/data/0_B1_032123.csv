Maui Island Water Use and Development Plan Update
Mr. Jeremy Kimura of CWRM Planning Branch, Eva Blumenstein (Maui DWS Planning Office), and Honorable Councilman Shane Sinenci provided the update.
Mr. Jeremy Kimura, CWRM Planning Branch Mr. Kimura gave a presentation on a proposed approach for adoption of the Maui Island Water Use and Development Plan Update and some of the issues that were raised through the public hearing process. He also talked about the staff’s analysis of the document and their recommendations as well as next steps. The Hawaii Water Plan is required in the State Water Code to plan for the State’s water future and is made up of several documents as a management toolbox. Links to the presentation and relevant documents were provided for those watching remotely.
Maui Councilman Shane Sinenci Shane Sinenci, Maui County council member and the former Chair of the Agriculture and Public Trust Committee which reviewed and approved the Water Development Plan before you today. The Department of Water supply spent considerable time creating this plan. I wanted to focus on the review process and the community work that went into this plan and put forth considerable time and effort to review and add to the plan over the last seven years which played an important role in shaping it into the document that you’re reviewing today. During my term as Chair, I held 15 Ag and Public Trust committee meetings on the plan. In previous years several other committees also worked on the plan including the water and infrastructure committee, the water infrastructure and transportation committee, and the environmental agriculture and cultural preservation committees. In my committee, council members went through each chapter of the document in each aquifer sector area as part of our review, and we added 49 new strategies and expanded five existing policies. We incorporated the addendum section throughout the corresponding areas of the document and into the document’s main body. We added information on Native Hawaiian water and cultural rights including information on the public trust doctrine, riparian rights, kuleana rights, konohiki rights and the duties of state agencies to protect Native Hawaiian traditional and customary rights which were included in the Ka Pa‘akai analysis sections. We wrote a new section entitled historical and cultural context of the regulatory system according to input from the ‘Aha Moku councils. We also added the consent decree and the Board of water supply temporary investigative report regarding the feasibility of purchasing and maintaining the EMI water delivery system to the appendices. I’m particularly proud of our work with the local Maui Island Aha Moku councils to ensure that water as a cultural resource is properly considered and addressed. My staff and I met with the local councils to integrate Native Hawaiian water resource management history, strategies, and generational knowledge into the plan. I want to note, that their input doesn’t mean that they support the plan. They remain neutral and that not all their recommended strategies were adopted by the Council, specifically the West Maui council asked for strategy of prohibiting water system connectivity to the Council. The Council did not adopt that. The ‘Aha Moku council in the Ko‘olau area also did not support the Haʻikū well strategy however, most of local council’s recommendations were adopted in part one of the plan. We added a section on kānāwai, a history of Hawaiian water law and for each area the council’s stress ecosystem management and returning water to the system as a result, strategies were adopted so requiring the county to advocate for stream connectivity and kalo cultivation, kuleana, and traditional rights, a strategy requiring the Department of Water Supply to use generational and traditional knowledge to compliment scientific data strategies were adopted directing the Department of Water Supply and county council to consult with local Native Hawaiians when making decisions. The plan now requires that a Native Hawaiian advisory group be established, and that the Department of Water Supply employees receive training on Hawaiian Resource Management and Hawaiian rights. The island Aha Moku councils and the general communities also cited a lack of enforcement by CWRM on stream IIFS and they hope you can work more with local volunteers for stream monitoring. Both the council and the general community ask for strategies to limit extravagant hotel water use and penalize water waste behaviors. We added strategies including policies directing the council to establish a new tiered rate structure and a separate hotel category that promotes water conservation. They ask that we add environmental protection strategies for dry land native forests. Wetland areas, aquifer recharge areas, groundwater, and policies directing the council to revise county laws to promote water catchment, water use efficient, landscaping and building requirements and water conservation for golf courses, resorts, and public facilities. Local area councils made some area specific comments for the Ko‘olau district. A strategy encourages home rule of Water Resources specifically the EMI system which was adopted for Hāna strategy establishing additional water priorities for kuleana users, cultural uses and affordable housing was adopted for Haʻikū members did not support the Haʻikū well strategy but that input did not result in any new strategies. In West Maui there was the request to adopt a strategy not to interconnect water systems across the different areas, but the committee members did not adopt that. So, while there are still community members who feel that areas need to be worked on, I see the plan as a living document. The plan is required to be updated regularly to reflect our ever-changing environment persistent with drought conditions, water scarcity, and new legislation also new state requirements including stream flow standards and inclusion of the newly created East Maui Water Authority board. Our community went over the plan and testified at each of the community meetings. There are concerns specifically about climate change and the need for the county to adopt more stringent water conservation goals. The current goal is eight percent over the next 20 years, and I know should strive for more. The plans also need to include updated data as Mr. Kimura had mentioned in the update. I would like to see data presented in an easier to understand in layman’s terms in ways that the public can easily understand. The Department of Water Supply may also want to hire a consultant for the update to make the plan easier for the public to use and I understand that other islands have also done this. There is also a need for the update to include information on the Water Authority ballot initiative that passed during our last election. We are in the process of creating the East Maui Community Water Authority board and it is our hope that having the county in control of Public Water Resources we can provide more resources to help satisfy the up-country water meter list applications. And finally, the Haʻikū community strongly spoke up against the Haʻikū aquifer as the main source of new county wells and they felt that this strategy is unfair because their needs have not been met. There was discussion in the committee about removing the Haʻikū well strategy, but not enough support was received to remove it and the major reason was that removing the Haʻikū well strategy as a source of water would have created an imbalance in the plan’s demand causing the plan to become invalid. The new water director stated yesterday that a consultant has been hired to complete a feasibility study as mandated by the court consent decree and so in closing I would just like to leave the commission members with an understanding of all the work that was put into this document it is a living document much like the importance of ka wai ola. The work doesn’t end today.
Ms. Eva Blumenstein – Maui Dept of Water Supply Just want to mahalo Councilmember Sinenci and the community and the commission staff that has spent so much time working diligently with the Department and private water conveyers. A lot of work went into this plan. We had an original plan submitted in 2010 to the commission that was rejected, it was not adequately addressing all the private purveyors, it wasn’t based on hydrologic units and we feel that the plan really now addressing these controversial issues that have been unsolved for 30 plus years. It doesn’t come up with a solution, but it really tackles it. We knew starting this reigniting the public outreach and doing this effort back in 2016 that there would be tradeoffs and some difficult compromises. After 70 plus meetings, we feel that the plan now meets the needs of the land use plans. It has support from the broader community. It’s not going to be everything to everyone but it’s a good tool. We’ve been able to use it already on the county level to guide our Capital Improvement program and investing in water resource protection so regardless the Commissions purposes we believe it meets the state water code and beyond even the framework so far, we are grateful for all the work that went into this and that we’ve been able to apply this as a guide for the county level.
asked Jeremy Kimura, how does the plan address that the majority of the water delivery system on Maui is controlled by private entities?
answered, it’s definitely one of the main challenges specifically for Maui because we have multiple private purveyors that are sometimes competing for the same resource, and we had to be really diligent developing this plan to make sure this is not the Department’s plan. This is not our CIP program but looking at all the needs of other purveyors and there’s only so many tools that can be used to implement strategies that address the private water purveyors because obviously the county doesn’t have jurisdiction of allocations to that extent. Some of the strategies, I can give you a couple of examples-call for more investment in water resource protection in watershed management based on the type of end uses if you are private purveyor using groundwater from a specific watershed. We should see better investments, matching investments for the water resource that you extract. If their strategies for optimizing alternative resources before using conventional groundwater or surface water, we want the planning department and the bodies that will approve land use entitlements to include that strategy as a condition of entitling a land use or approving a land use permit. We’ve been working closely with Maui Planning Department to set that up so in areas that are not designated, there’s all these different tools but it’s always a challenge whether that is for conservation. I mean large municipalities are better equipped to have well-funded conservation programs or source protection programs and private purveyors benefit from that but other strategies such as regulating conservation measures in the future where proposing conservation bills could apply to all water purveyors and doesn’t have to be for only county owned systems, just a couple of examples. Dr. Kagawa- Viviani: Thanked Jeremy, Councilmember Sinenci and Eva for that overview. I guess I’m thinking mostly about that first complaint about that existing plan and I, myself, found it really difficult to navigate a 1360-page document that didn’t have a clickable table of contents. I was wondering that because Maui is at this inflection point and as you emphasize community engagement is key,you know the document itself doesn’t invite participation, it doesn’t invite access. And parts of the document may have been overlooked because it is hard to find. Are there or can you develop a more accessible format of this document without having to go thru all the council approval just to make it more accessible and to allow for people to focus on the sections in the document that relate to them or search it? Because, even the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report which is a totally an unwieldy beast has broken things down in a way to make it more accessible. Is that possible? I can see some easy things, but I don’t know if that’s for Jeremy or for Eva or Councilmember Sinenci? Is there a way to keep the content there but make it more accessible without having to go through council processes?
I’ll just mention from the commission side that I totally agree with you on making all these documents much more accessible. I think it’s a big issue too in terms of transparency making things more accessible for everyone to read goes a long way towards transparency in terms of government. The Commission, we are committed to working with the department on creating a summary document that would be easy for people to look at, so I’ll leave it to Eva I’m not sure in terms of times and resources they’re willing to expand on it but we are happy to work on that with the County.
This is something we heard not until the draft plan was submitted to the board and board hearings. As the plan went through County Council, it grew and grew, it started at a fairly large quantity, and it grew another couple hundred pages so it’s an unwieldy document and the original format was never set up for easy access for the public. So, at this point and time when it’s been passed as coordinates, I agree with Jeremy. We would like to have something that’s more of a brief summary for general consumption and that document can be updated more quickly. A matrix showing sort of an implementation matrix of what kind of quantitative and qualitive criteria we should look at over the implementation of this plan because obviously there’s all these different strategies that translate into projects to be scoped out where’s there’s more opportunities for community input whatever that is. You know environmental assessments, well construction, permits conservation bills, etc. so that sort of like a smaller user friendly public use document we would like to have that would just be quicker update because we know there’s not realistic update of what your surround plan in five years has done that so as long as this is the format of the framework and the state water code it’s going to take this long you’re going to have some outdated information in the plan but we would definitely like to have a brief summary document to have for more immediate use for the public. 
I wanted to clarify that a summary document would be great but even just the table of contents. isn’t hyperlinked to sections, so you have to scroll down. That doesn’t even require any substance. Is that something that could be done expediently and just as a step. And as for the updatethe idea that this is a living document, that there will be version b or 2.0 in five years? Because people are going to refer to the plan, if it’s a moving piece how are you going to control versioning?
I mentioned the implementation matrix similar to the community and the land use plans. You don’t update version ABC until you actually update the whole plan. The policies are intended to be long term and what use demand changes more quickly than that so implementation matrix will be the tool to follow lead agencies funding other projects and what not. But that could also have more of a summary that’s easier used and applied by the public that would follow maybe be attached to capital improvement program proposals or whatever the projects that we’re scoping out.
Quick question: What page is the implementation matrix? On a word search, I could not find anything matching implementation matrix.
{long pause} Okay this is a sign right here about it . This speaks well to the point that was just made.
Thank you Jeremy just to help me put things into context other key elements providing input to the county plan or state plans. How current are these plans? Like the water quality plan, the resource protection plans the ag water plan or does the county need to sort of update that on their own? How does the integration of that database work as the counties go through their water development plan?
Good question. They’re all sort of moving targets in a way so I’ll just say the water resource protection plan which we’ve done was updated last in 2019 and the water quality plan as well. Joanna can confirm this with 2019 as well which water resource plan is the big one since it has the sustainable yield numbers. That’s what the counties need to use to plan for the development as well as policies on instream flow standard setting and things like that. The ag water use development plan has been a difficult one in a sense that there’s been several updates. I think you might have been here when the Department of Ag did their last update to us and there was a lot of pushback on this recent update to the plan so it’s sort of in development right now where we’ve sent them comments on how they can improve it and put more information in but the latest version of that plan is really from 2012. I believe the only numbers that are being used by the water plan preparers right now is that estimation of ag zone lands or ag entitlements. The water duty could be right for these places. The state water projects plan recently just completed I believe in 2020 was the last statewide update for state projects across the state and previous to that in 2019 we had for Department of Hawaiian Home Lands an update was done so those projections went into the different plans. One of the big things that came out of the state water projects plan update was we got an idea of what the reservation should be for DHHL that’s what we’re using to set the reservations for the State. They’re all sorts of moving targets. The big one is the ag water use and development plan needs to be updated and we are working with the Department of Ag as you know they have new leadership now, so we are trying to work with that team to make sure that plan gets updated because we see it as a critical component for water planning. 
Jeremy, on this issue of ag water. Just clarify my memory if you will. Haven’t we been using 2500 gallons per acre per day in most of our agricultural allocations?
maybe Kaleo can speak to that but the planning number that has been adopted is 3400 gallons per acre. People may ask for less I think because that’s kind of an old number that was developed kind of a while ago. I believe staff is using things like our irrigation estimation model to get a better idea of what demand is for the specific geographic area I think that’s resulted in lower per capita recommendations from staff.
2500 gallons per day comes from the Waiāhole Water Case and it’s been kind of what we’ve used as a conservative number. But in the Ag Water Use Development Plan it is closer to what Jeremy said and what we are also using is IWRREDS which is a tool we partnered with Ulupono to develop and to estimate actual site-specific agricultural irrigation demands based on type of irrigation, evapotranspiration, all of that and soil moisture is all factored into it so it gets us more parcel specific estimates. All of those are presented to the Commission in its decision making. Ultimately the commission has kind of leaned more towards the conservative number of 2500 gallons per acre per day in order to encourage conservation. As Jeremy has talked about, we are looking at ranges and not necessarily definitive points for a number and if it can be justified through water reporting and data, we try to make it as real as possible.
When we encourage or induce our people, we have the wisdom to invest in infrastructure that allow them to have water storage. Are they then able to supplement and meet any gaps that they have in irrigation need by way of our allocation of 2500 plus a supplemental infusion of water coming from their own storage systems?
That’s a great strategy and something we’d love to actually test and get proof on and data to support but unfortunately a lot of our agricultural users or systems in general aren’t collecting that data and aren’t doing that type of analysis. We need to push all water purveyors whether it’s potable or non-potable to really start to look at how we can be better stewards of those resources and collect the data because I don’t have a definitive answer for you that that strategy is actually working.
Look forward to that continuing discussion. Second question: Councilman, thank you for that report I really appreciate the way you responded to the questions and the issues that were raised by the public by saying okay if you say our data is old or you say there’s gaps, here’s what we did, here’s what we included and I really appreciate that approach to it and then invite what we missed and seems like people said you missed this you then went and backfilled that information into your plan in which I think is an excellent approach. My question for you is on the issue of incentivizing or inducing conservation. We live in an era of excesses when people can actually afford to be excessive and are undaunted by a fine or a tiered rate schedule to be excessive, are you finding that having that strategy of having higher rates really works to induce conservation in certain aquifers or might we have to put the very permit at risk or have the power to make our own reductions if they don’t comply. What’s working?
Great question and I think the tiered structure was one of the first efforts to address those very large users. Some of the hotels that still had those huge water uses during a pandemic when they were closed so I think that was the first step. But you’re right, part of the strategies we had to do it in conjunction with other things. For instance, the water director talked about expanding our R1 uses. If we are going to use so much water, we need to expand our R1 uses in those areas where there’s high water use so that we can use recycled water in some of those areas. The tiered work but also pun intended multi-tiered approach to doing other things in conjunction with those conservation efforts. The higher water taxes was just to kind of deter and encourage conservation but you’re right there’s other things that we still need to also do. Some of the things where if there’s a lot of pool usage, we should be covering pools for evaporation so that they are not being evaporated in the dry areas so those are some of the discussions that came out throughout our two-year process.
I think throughout our government we are looking at the issue of fines and for some people those fines are meaningless so if fines are meant to induce conformance and compliance it doesn’t work.
It’s normally upcountry that has the water restrictions, so we are hoping to expand water use whether it be thru the East Maui Water Authority to increase water from there or other sources so that we’re not putting certain parts of the County on water restrictions while others enjoy more water use.
Chair the last question is for you. My zoom screen is showing that perhaps Lucienne Danaie and Keaaumoku Kapu is interested in testifying on this matter is that correct?
Thank you I just want to confirm that this plan is really a framework. It’s to guide future decisions. It in and of itself is not an authorization or decision. I do appreciate the County’s responsiveness to the questions and Shane in particular. Mahalo for your effort and community engagement. That’s really where I come from, I’m kind of a process person. It’s important that people feel like they’ve been heard and listened to and you apparently did a lot of that. You heard the concerns, made appropriate adjustments especially with respect to native Hawaiian rights and issues, so again mahalo for taking the pause not rushing to get the plan approved but really taking the time to engage the community in ways that are meaningful to them so that this document is much more reflective of their concerns and approaches.
Just a comment, this commission is not a stranger to controversial issues on Maui with water and seeing all the comments it sure would be great in April to have some sort of smaller executive summary or something. You guys have worked so hard on this to be able to have a 1300-page document that nobody can access is not really reflective of the work you’ve put in so, I’m really hoping that in April there is some sort of summary to make it a little more easy to read I think that would benefit all the future water issues on Maui.
I did have one more follow up it’s actually directed to our ex-officio DOHrepresentative and the presenters. I’m thinking about O‘ahu and Maui’s trajectory of urbanization and our current water issues that I’m becoming more and more aware of. I’m teaching water and society this semester and get lots of questions from the students. We’ve covered recycled water and emerging contaminants so in the case of Maui we do want to use recycled water but how worried should we be about these emerging organic contaminants and pharmaceuticals that are in our wastewater streams as well as nitrates? Because it’s not just about water amounts and allocations. As we’re using more water, you’re creating more wastewater to have to then spend energy cleaning. So, if you have thoughts about that and how to think about it in context. 
The department is supportive of reuse in the state and is working very closely with the county of Maui on their reuse program and procedures and the future of it. So, there is a review of the treatment train which is used for the reuse water and the importance of the treatment of the emerging contaminants as well as those contaminants that we are aware of. There is research that is being done. We are aware and keeping track of it and we have staff from the department that is attending reuse conferences and symposiums and they are trying to keep up with all the changing improvements to the processes so that we can bring them here back to Hawai‘i.
I’m testifying on behalf of the Haʻikū Community Association. We certainly mahalo all the efforts that were made on this plan. We were not consulted about the complete strategy of East Maui wells. We were invited to some vague meetings that were talking about an East Maui groundwater strategy. This is not the way to engage the public. If all the water or majority of water for the Central Maui area is to come from Haʻikū, no one in Haʻikū is able to get a water meter for 20 years. I want people to understand that then you have a meeting in Haʻikū and you announce what your plan is in Haʻikū so that you can figure out the solution that fits for everyone. I’ve heard the presentations today this is a framework this or that please keep in mind every environmental impact document will cite this plan and will not cite the policies it will site the numbers in the charts it will say you know the chart says there’s two million gallons a day available for hotel growth in West Maui is that going to be a real fact after we look at what the real water situation of West Maui is? Is that going to be a fact of life? If not, it shouldn’t be in this plan or there should be a footnote that says this may be adjusted greatly and should be reflected in any documents. Every environmental document is going to say there’s eight million gallons a day available for the central system because they’re going to drill wells in Haʻikū. Do we know if those wells in Haʻikū are going to produce that amount? We do not. And the previous draft of a plan which this commission rejected from 2010 stated that there were great uncertainties about the Haʻikū strategy and about several other strategies. It was honest. This plan is not honest. I can’t go into the details, I only have 3 minutes. I guess the only way to explain these details is to ask for a contested case and have time to really explain. This is not about conservation measures like turning off the water when you brush your teeth, this is looking at South Maui where 11 million gallons a day of potable treated County water is used and 5 million ends up at the sewage treatment plant the other 6 million is probably used for irrigation. Is that a sound strategy when we are facing climate change? This document has the mealy mouth. It doesn’t say we need a strategy to make this different now the folks in South Maui are talking about this they’re updating their community plan right now and they’re suggesting two million gallons being used to water in Wailea. Can we not use that water and instead use R1 water to irrigate these deserts into oasis. Our plan just leaves out this important information in spite of everybody’s attempts and it should be readable. Our former plan was readable. In fact, the 1990 draft was not accepted by this commission. That’s a fact that’s kind of buried a new 1992 version that was done by a consultant, not done in house. I can’t even start to explain how off this data is, framework or not, everyone is going to be looking at the data when your data says that A and B is going to be needing 4000 to5000 thousand gallons per day per acre or Maui Mahipono and their actual reports that are available online show that they’re using under 2 thousand million gallons a day over the 5,000 acres they’ve planted. Something’s wrong. We don’t have the right data here and we can’t have a good plan. In fact, this plan is not going to be updated in five years, it may be another 20 years because it’s structured so poorly. The structure needs to be redone and it needs to be made updatable. I commend the efforts that Councilmember Sinenci made. He was honest with you. Many of the things that were asked for by the kanaka community were completely ignored despite his best efforts simply because people don’t want to face the inconvenient truth that we have less water. We can’t have the same farming strategies. We can’t have 23 percent loss with our ditch systems. We can’t have 60 percent water system. I think there will need to be a contested case to really explain what is not right with this plan and why you should not accept it so thank you Commissioners for listening.
Aloha Chair Chang and Commission. Mahalo for this opportunity for me to testify. Mahalo to the CWRM staff, Jeremy Kimura, for his synopsis on all the data details provided and also the hearing for our community concerns was great to share this around coming from your third staff and mahalo to council Shane Sinenci for having dialogue with our Moku Island counselors and implementing Native Hawaiian and kuleana cultural traditional rights and sharing the importance of seeking traditional generational knowledge. Why that is important is because we’re losing a lot of our ground rooted kupuna in our community. It’s really important we seek the mana‘o from them now to try and see how we can incorporate those values with water use development plan. We in Maui like how this is going. We finally feel we have a great opportunity of being a part of a greater result and hoping that now that Komohana which is the West side of Maui is finally being designated gives us a greater opportunity to being a part of having a primary result and bringing more honest  recommendations. I hope that in the future we will always be a part of the recommendation provided for the Maui water use development plan. Komohana is different in many ways. The West side of Maui has been bombarded by private interests and the municipalities between the county as well as the private sector. It’s good to see that the state has designated a referee to bring our major concerns to the forefront and when we didn’t support the plan it was generally for the whole of Maui not just Komohana. But also Hikina in the East side of Kihei that the plan was really lacking a lot of grassroots information’s on how the community concerns can be met. But I mahalo all of you for your due diligence. I know that this is not an action item. I just wanted to mahalo the route this is going. It’s great for the Komohana community knowing that hopefully on the East side when they start the water authority, they’ll be some kind of value in it. We can actually look at things and help incorporate on Komohana’s side on the West side of Maui. So, Mahalo for your time and mahalo for this opportunity to testify and I’m willing to answer any of your questions. Thank you.
