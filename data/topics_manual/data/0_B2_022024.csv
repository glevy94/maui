Briefing on the Commission’s Approach to Addressing Water for Temporary Housing Needs for Areas of Maui Affected by Wildfires
Staff provided an update on CWRM’s water permitting process for temporary housing projects serviced by Maui DWS and private purveyors.
This is really a desire of transparency so that the Commission was well aware. Things are moving very fast on the Maui temp housing and FEMA is primarily taking the lead here. The state is deferring to the county and their priorities, but both CWRM, State Historic Preservation Division, our Engineering Division, our Land Division, all of our different divisions are playing a role in assisting on the Maui temp housing. But water is really critical so we felt comfortable in reviewing both the Code that if the county is a provider, then that would be considered an existing use versus if we had a private purveyor, that would require a new permit. We just wanted to update you on that.
What proportion will there be between the Department of Water Supply and private?
With the existing use permits that were filed?
No, when the temporary housings are being put up, any idea about which ones are going to be covered by private purveyors?
No, not at this point. Things have been changing almost weekly so I could tell you one thing today and it might be different tomorrow, honestly.
Larry, we are encouraging them like with State Historic Preservation Division to facilitate this process because we’re not trying to cut any, to stay with county purveyors.
If these are temporary housing, then they’re going to be built much faster than regular housing. As far as the timing permits, do we have a process that we can speed it up or?
For new permits?
Yeah.
Unfortunately, they’re following under our existing process set forth in the code so that’s why we’re encouraging them to try to utilize county water supply to facilitate the process because otherwise we would have to go through all the 140 permits before we issue out a new permit.
That’s right, I forgot about that.
Which is quite significant, yes.
Most of that what I presume would be for household use and would therefore require treatment most likely by either a private or public utility?
Domestic uses.
I was digging a little and I understand there are three candidate sites, two of them being in sort of West Maui Lahaina aquifer sector. The one that FEMA put forth as having a final EA and finding a no significant impact is the Kāʻanapali temporary housing and then my understanding is that another potential one is Leialiʻi. Kāʻanapali is currently serviced by Hawaiʻi Water Service and Leialiʻi/DHHL is serviced by MDWS, is that correct?
The DHHL, I’m not sure.
This is why we’re looking at private or MDWS as having implications for the Commission. Then yesterday in the news there was a groundbreaking for a Kāʻanapali employee, sorry Kapalua. Sorry, obviously I don’t know West Maui geography very well, but that would be under an existing use, right? Because they already...
Could be, we haven’t gotten the full details on that.
Ok, so there’s different arrays of temporary housing, too, like private, federally funded and I am not a housing person.
It is a moving target, so I think the State is trying to utilize the FEMA funds as the priority. We are trying to direct them to areas that we think both from a Historic Preservation Division standpoint less cultural resources, minimal impacts, already existing archaeological inventory survey will facilitate the process because they also have to comply with Section 106, likewise with CWRM. Ultimately the decision will be made by FEMA and the county and the state, but we’re trying to direct them to, if you’re looking for facilitated process, giving them some guidance like utilize the county. We’ve been in discussion with the county as well.
Pertaining to water, specifically the Kāʻanapali group housing since it’s served by wells in Honokōwai that have historically had some chloride issues and writing off of B1 ask, is Hawaiʻi Water Service working on a water shortage plan? Because it’s maybe not a problem now, but as housing infrastructure is built and temporary housing becomes something else, we’re going to be putting strain on Honokōwai, which is already strained and that’s our responsibility. I know things are moving fast there, but how are Commission staff thinking about how we take a regional approach?
That’s certainly something we’re going to have to look at in the bigger picture as we go through the water use permit applications. My understanding is Hawaiʻi Water Service has been doing it now is that they’ve been rotating the pumpages on their batteries of wells to avoid the chloride issues. If they see an uptick then they’ll shift their pump to other sources within their system.
So, it’s just within. On item B1, Eva mentioned working on interconnections so my understanding from reviewing the Maui Water Use and Development Plan, Lahaina sector is that there are no service interconnections in between different purveyors in the system. Is that true?
I believe so.
There’s no backup redundancy. That’s something maybe not necessarily for us but could be an issue in the future. My question to Dean is how are we as a Commission thinking about our due diligence to ensure protection of public trust in this area where we’ve already had some challenges like Commissioner Miike mentioned? We’ve tended to just award permits, but how are we putting some bounds on that? Have we given thought to that?
Honestly, I haven’t given too much thought to it yet. I haven’t had a chance to really review all the water use permit applications that have come in. Certainly, our staff, Alexa, and Ayron in particular, are well versed in the area. I think it’s really going to come down to a balancing of priority uses and the public trust. There’s going to have to be cutbacks for certain uses that aren’t public trust uses and certainly we’re going to have to look more critically at water shortage plans in this area and how we apply those plans in water shortage situations. In the next agenda item, we’re going to bring up some bills and we left out the ones that are basically dead, that have been deferred or didn’t get a hearing. As was mentioned in the prior submittal item, there was a bill for emergency water shortage situations and emergency declarations. Right now, there’s only one bill that remains and that would have been a great tool that in this situation where you have water purveyors, you have both private and County and in those water shortage situations, I think was mentioned prior, there’s very few if any controls over the private purveyors and how that water is used. I think that bill that was introduced would have given us a little more power in those situations or our ability in those situations to spread out the use so that it’s ensuring that it is for public trust uses in water shortage situations.
Ayron mentioned some innovative suggestions way back in September/October about R1. Has there been any progress on that? I know FEMA money expires and you need to move fast but that could alleviate. My understanding is the Lahaina wastewater treatment plant does produce R1, well some portion of it is treated to R1 and some portion of that R1 is used but there’s a lot that isn’t.
Ayron may be able to speak to that better. The county is certainly working towards expanding their use of R1. There is currently a bill that is seeking to provide tax incentives for the purchase of reservoirs and such to expand the R1. It kind of just took a broad brush that we can go over, but I think we’re certainly promoting to the County that they expand their R1 use in the region.
If I can just add on to this. The Lahaina fire has definitely required all of us to really pivot. Right when CWRM was beginning to start focusing on the Water Management Area designation and looking at the water use permits, it might have almost been that same day the applications were due is when the fire hit. Now, moving into the recovery stage, Maui temp housing has really become a critical focus of CWRM and how do we help facilitate. I think that the approach that CWRM has taken on saying what’s an existing water use that doesn’t require a water use permit, one really trying to support the County here, the county DWS in all of their efforts. If it has a county connection then it should help facilitate that process. Because the Maui refocus has required us to be more reactionary than proactive, the way that we’re approaching it is still trying to be one, supportive of the County, recognizing that private purveyors, we don’t have as much control over that. I’m trying to support the Maui County including both in legislation on how to provide them more resources to emphasize alternative reuse or recycled but also giving them the tools to also potentially acquire some of these private systems to supplement what they have. This has really required CWRM to dedicate a tremendous amount of resources to assisting on the Maui temp housing. Again, this is just temp housing. This effort is not intended to look at permanent affordable housing, this is just Maui temp housing for the Maui residents who have been displaced by the Maui wildfires.
Just again, background. You have 140 permits currently, more to be added. I guess two questions. One is what kind of resources are you going to avail yourself for these permit reviews to do it in a timely manner? I sense that timing is important. Secondly, because this is for temporary use, is there a sunset on these permits?
For the first question, our staff is reviewing them now. They’re focused on working their way from Honokohau – south. They’re meeting weekly and we’re meeting weekly as a staff. They’re meeting individually to review permits, draft letters that need to go out if information is missing. How fast that goes, I think last year we gave a general idea of mid 2024 that we could start to address them. I think we’re at a phase where it’s at least that long if not maybe a little longer.
How does that comport with the sense of establishing these housing units?
We are advocating that Maui DWS serve the projects. If it is private, that’s a discussion we’re going to have to have as far as temporary housing goes. They are temporary, there is a requirement that they need to be, I don’t know if the term is removed or taken down or what have you, but there is a sunset date. My understanding is that FEMA requires the housing cannot be left there in perpetuity. How that plays out we still have to have those discussions.
That to me maybe helps in terms of taking rather than a real comprehensive holistic view, it’s just establishing residency with the understanding of a sunset, that you can reexamine the process again. I think if your timetable for actually granting permits is within the view of whoever the purveyor is or whoever the residents establishing that, I think that’s what you need to drive towards. Thanks Dean, I know it’s a challenge.
To say the least, but they’ve been doing remarkable in really trying to facilitate. I think the temp housing, they’re looking at two to three years. Most of these housing, they’re modular so they’re all being shipped in. A lot of them are coming in on barges as we speak and trying to have spaces available to put them. Again, these are intended only for temporary but we’ll see what happens at the end.
So, there is a sunset on these?
I think it is two to three years, the term of the emergency proclamation and FEMA’s commitment.
Aloha Chair Chang and Commissioners. My name is Elena Bryant testifying on behalf of Earthjustice and I’d like to make six brief comments on agenda item B2. First, we want to thank Commission staff for briefing this issue in a public meeting because it encourages transparency and given the significant community interest in this issue, we appreciate that the Commission is updating the community in this way. That said, without specifics including sites it’s not as helpful as it could be so to be useful the info briefings really need to include specific sites. Second, we support temporary emergency housing for Lahaina residents and we agree that it makes sense in this situation that water for the temporary housing would be covered under Maui DWS’ existing use because it’s only shifting end uses from Lahaina to the new temporary housing site. We also agree that any new purveyor would be required to apply for a new water use permit. Our interest here is making sure we aren’t heading into another plantation disaster capitalism situation and we’re here to help you makaʻala and ensure everything is pono given that you are truly our kahuwai pono. Third, we are concerned about the possible use of an emergency proclamation in this matter. While you folks haven’t directly addressed that, it’s the clear implication given what the Governor has shared of potential sites via the news. This is a significant concern given that the Governor has not been pono with his use of emergency proclamations in the past so we’re closely monitoring this to ensure that any EP would honor the public trust and ensure that emergency powers are not abused as they have been in the water context in Maui Komohana in the wake of the fires. Fourth, we are wondering which sites are being considered. There’s been talk in the news by the Governor for example about Leialiʻi and other talk about Kapalua and Kāʻanapali as mentioned by Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani and without more information on sites, the briefing is less helpful. The community needs to know what’s on the table. Fifth, based on Eva’s presentation on B1 where the highest use for Maui county is 291 or so gallons per day, we expect that the requested allocation for temporary homes presumably without irrigated outside areas via any County system should be in alignment with the County’s actual numbers like 300. Even that’s generous. Based on Eva’s presentation, it seems like it’s more around 200 in most areas and 300 in areas with larger lots which isn’t what you’d get with temporary emergency housing. Regardless, there doesn’t seem to be a need for 600 GPD of allocation in the state water system standards if the County’s actual numbers are closer to 200 or 300. Finally, we believe it is critical for the community to continue to be updated as the temporary housing projects proceed and so we respectfully request that the Commission continue to hold these types of informational briefings but with information on specific sites and if it doesn’t plan to do so, we would respectfully request that Earthjustice continue to be updated on this issue moving forward. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
My only comment is that I know, Chair, you said that the housing issues are likely temporary at this moment, however I’ll just urge the Commission to consider thinking of this holistically and understanding that infrastructure will be put in place with these temporary housings. I guess my suggestion to the Commission is to look at it as if there is a potential for these housing projects to become permanent. Just keeping that in mind because of the amount of investment and infrastructure that will be put in place so please consider that as you go through the permitting process and consider the water distribution. Mahalo.
Wayne Tanaka from Sierra Club of Hawaiʻi. First, I really appreciate the opportunity to get some insight into what’s going on with the temporary housing project. I also really appreciate the Chair’s comment about the importance of community involvement and engagement in the last agenda item and I think that’s particularly heightened for disaster recovery with so much at stake and with some of I guess the missteps we’ve seen in Maui Komohana and then some other uses of the executive emergency authorities. We want to state our support for the Maui Komohana community and their involvement in their recovery efforts. I support the Commission’s effort to keep the public informed and to express our caution against using emergency authorities to unnecessarily evade community engagement and consultation, particularly when the community are the folks that are most familiar with their ʻāina and most invested in their long-term well-being and can help identify some unintended impacts and also can actually support some of the priorities that the Commission has mentioned including R-1 reuse. I do want to encourage the Commission to continue keeping the public informed including with some of the specifics that may make these kinds of meetings, these briefings more meaningful and accessible. I would respectfully suggest maybe having a meeting in Maui Komohana for the next briefing or presentation on these matters, particularly when you have more specific information for them to consider. With that, thank you so much and looking forward to hearing more.
Given the testifier’s sort of press for community involvement in a process that is essentially kind of bureaucratic and needing to be fast-tracked, we got a couple suggestions, but are there other ways in which we can help support transparency given the contention of water issues and the interactions with housing and the distrust that needs to be reestablished.
I’ll take that one on and then Dean you can add to that. Our intent with this agenda item was really to provide the Water Commissioners an update on the approach that CWRM was taking on the temp Maui housing. Given that it’s a Water Management Designation area and how are we addressing this and so it wasn’t really intended or designed to be on specific Maui temp housing projects. I think the County may be having some forums on discussing Maui temp housing and in our view that would be more appropriate there. Here at CWRM I have been trying through our Water Commission meetings to provide a public platform to inform the community but in this particular instance it was really to update the Commissioners on how we were approaching the permitting process given the Water Management Designation, but not specifically intending to talk about Maui temp housing. Just a clarification. I appreciate the fact that there’s been many comments about that, the lack of transparency. I am all about process but I’m also wanting to be very cognizant that to a large extent these projects are in flux. We are but one component of the regulatory review process and the State is really trying to support the County of Maui in their determination of priority areas, locations. We provide guidance to facilitate the process, find a location that you’ve got water rather than trying to be reactionary, trying to assist them. Where do we have existing water resources in particular I think as a matter of policy for me, too. I’m really looking at how do we support the Maui County, Maui water department because it is consistent with our water code as an existing use permit. But determination of housing areas, we’re leaving that up to the County and FEMA and who’s really identifying those. If there is a suggestion that we have this on our regular agenda, that was probably not our intention, that we weren’t going to be providing updates to the Water Commission on specific Maui temp housing projects if that’s what people were looking for. Were you interested in that, Aurora?
No but reviewing the final EA and the one or two sentences on water resources and knowing that there was a 9-day comment period, I wasn’t aware of this until Civil Beat posted the link. Anyways, I guess it didn’t sound like they had talked to anyone and especially because Honokowai was the one section that has problems. If I went back to the Lahaina designation and DOH (Department of Health) has a lengthy description of how chlorides regularly exceed thresholds, six out of nine wells. I just want to make sure that we are not creating potential problems we’re going to have a harder time dealing with down the road and that we also are makaʻala to that issue. Hawaiʻi Water System has a certain number of wells, I mean where’s that water going to come from? So, we’re not reacting as much and I know we’re all in reaction mode but how can we be more proactive and maybe we have to give a little more attention and background to the decision makers who are making these really quick decisions and consolidate information for them just so we don’t have more problems down the road and that was the whole point with designation.
I will assure you, CWRM staff that participate in these discussions, they are conveying those sensitivities. I think they have a good appreciation for the concerns that have been raised and they make those very clear in some of those internal discussions.
And then let us as Commissioners know how we can back up and allow you to do that work, too. Again, I say nobody can fire me from my volunteer position.
This was really a courtesy to the Commission and to members of the public to give you an idea of how CWRM is making determinations as they provide input into the ultimate decisions about these different projects. With that determination comes a lot of sensitivities and that’s why the determination to support DWS if the County is providing that it’s an existing use. Private purveyor, that’s a new use that requires a new permit that will go through all that engenders so much more of the regulatory review processes and participation. We’re trying to be very helpful to Maui temp housing. We have residents that need more stable housing, I take not permanent, but they need stability so we are all trying to be part of a solution but yet at the same time not compromise the positions that the Commission has taken in the past regarding many of these sensitive and critical issues. I’m trying to walk this very fine line.
I just had an additional comment. You had mentioned that it’s the County and FEMA who are going to take the leads in choosing the location which we completely understand and agree, but I just wanted to note in order to make the determination about whether a use is reasonable beneficial, the Commission does need site specific information. I think this is important especially if the Commission isn’t going to be issuing a water use permit which is the is the case with the County and so I just wanted to add that.
Appreciate that comment. What I can share is I think our CWRM staff include that balance as part of the contributions that they make to these discussions. Thank you very much.
