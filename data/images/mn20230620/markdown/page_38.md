assess resources in different aquifer systems right now, and part of that process, we have a consultant kind of vet or revisit the demand and supply projections to see, are they still valid? You know, they were done -- they're five years old and whatnot. Then, you know, turns out they're fairly valid, but for Central -- so, for example, we had projected we need another 8 million gallons a day by year 2035; turns out we need 11 mgd by year 2040. So it's -- it's a living document in that it's constantly -- you know, we track private purveyors' water use, those that report, and we track our own water use, obviously, and kind of adjust those projections as we go and as projects are scoped out.

CHAIR CHANG: No, thank you, that's very helpful. I mean, I think it is helpful to have a document that can be sort of the central location of current information, you know, a framework for planning, but it is helpful to have the document that is, you know, constantly updated and reflects real-time, but it is something -- a document that it's not -- it can be a guiding document for more than just government or the county, but others as well, so that's good. Okay, thank you very much.

Any other questions? I've also -- thank you, Eva, and thank you, John, for your testimony, your comments.

I also have on -- is it Gina Young? Is Gina on?

DEPUTY MANUEL: I don't see her, Chair.
