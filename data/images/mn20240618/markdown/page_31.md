**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** I understand, what you're saying is it doesn't.

**ANDREW CHOY:** Yeah, that's your responsibility as the Water Commission.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** I hear you, okay thanks.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Andrew, when you say it's based upon the Island Plans, what's the time frame? Is that when you're ready to build? Because we say Water Code is past, present, and future, so what is your time frame?

**ANDREW CHOY:** That's an excellent question. Our Island Plans for our administrative rule is a 20-year outlook on what we can or hopefully can develop assuming that we receive sufficient funding for developments.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Are the reservations based upon a future estimate up to 20 years?

**ANDREW CHOY:** Yes, because it's based on our Island Plans and our Island Plans have a 20-year outlook.

**CHAIR CHANG:** I guess this is water staff, so when we have to make the hard questions about water allocations, we take their reservations as whether they are ready to build or not. Do we distinguish between whether it’s a DHHL residential use or DHHL industrial commercial use? Is there a distinction? Is it just if DHHL’s reservations we take them as a whole or do we distinguish the types of use as we would for example public trust?

**DR. STRAUCH:** Their calculation is dependent on their land use plans and then just comes up with that number, we don't make that…

**CHAIR CHANG:** Okay, so we take it as DHHL reservations, but Andrew do you guys distinguish when you submit to us? Is there a difference between domestic and commercial?

**ANDREW CHOY:** We do try to identify for the Commission staff what our reservation amount is based off of and again that's per our land uses. We do distinguish our residential demand, our agricultural demand, our commercial demand. The reservations that we have submitted to the Water Commission to date have been primarily for our homesteading purposes, either residential, agriculture, or pastoral.

**CHAIR CHANG:** There's a comment that you made that, well maybe I should ask the question. Who pays for the water infrastructure, who pays for the delivery of water?
