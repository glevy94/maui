Dean Uyeno, CWRM Stream Protection and Management Branch Mr. Uyeno stated the summary of request stands on its written submittal and read the staff’s recommendations as noted in the submittal.
Commissioners do you have any questions for Dean?
I have. Commissioner Miike, do you have a problem with C? The extinguishing of the appurtenant rights given your prior position?
It's the same thing, but in this case it's not going to be really applied except for that point that small amount is priority three that would have been one. I do have a comment though, but I was waiting to see if they were going to say anything.
Do I have the applicants? Oh, I’m sorry. Go ahead, Larry.
Actually, you know the Code exempts domestic use from the permit requirements. I don’t have a problem with using the permit to follow that, but another way would be that they would have to register their use as a way of us accounting for water and for use with putting conditions. All I was pointed out was that the Code actually says you don’t need a permit for domestic use.
Important. Good point. Mr., is that Mark? I'm sorry, I can’t see your last name.
Yes, you have to unmute me. Am I unmuted? Chair Chang: You are unmuted, yes.
Yes, when I was the founding dean of the School of Hawaiian Asian and Pacific Studies at UH Manoa, I was quite close to the Hawaiian community and had a role in preserving the last lo‘i in O‘ahu. Today if you go to the School of Hawaiian Studies, it's now split off from the school that I helped to found, you'll find the lo‘i still standing which I’m really quite proud. So, when my wife and I retired a couple years ago, we came to Maui. I wanted to have a place that we could kind of preserve some of the Hawaiian tradition of creating a bamboo house in Polynesian style which I don't live in. It's definitely a kind of retreat house. Actually, the only people living there now, are from Lāhainā because as you know we've had this horrible tragedy on Maui and so I've divided my place for evacuees at least for present. But most of it’s an orchard of papaya, of banana, of guava, lychee and the like, but I’d like to grow kalo also. The catchment system provides water for much of the, particularly during the rainy season, but I need water for kalo and then of course when it's very dry and the river is right there. All I’m proposing is that in times of necessity it would be an occasional use to put this temporary pump which is like a three foot pipe into the water for a couple hours and be able to fill up the catchment tank and then remove it so it would not be permanently in the water and that's my request: an occasional use of water using this temporary pump; primarily so I can grow kalo and have a small lo‘i on the site.
Questions? Was that use considered, Dean, in the application? Lo‘i kalo? Okay.
It was my understanding that there are appurtenant rights from the documents that I have that go back to Kamehameha the Fourth because at one time it was a Mahele with the, not for a village because it’s a kind of flood area from the river, but an area in which kalo was grown. So, I don't know whether the staff took that into consideration. That was my understanding.
