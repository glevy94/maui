COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Chair, may I ask a question, please?  
CHAIR CHANG: Yes  
COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Mr. Arakaki, once the stormwater is collected and passed through whatever filtration or processing that you're planning, is that covered by NPDES?  
MR. ARAKAKI: Yes, it is. It will be. It'll be under the City and County's NPDES permit.  
COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: So, isn't there a requirement to measure water quality in the discharge?  
MR. ARAKAKI: I'm not sure if measurement and analysis of stormwater is in their NPDES program. I would have to get back to you.  
DR. STRAUCH: So the City and County monitors across the island to ensure compliance with the NPDES program, but, you know, they're not monitoring daily, they're monitoring --  
COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: But isn't the permit issued to --  
DR. STRAUCH: -- (inaudible) every year.  
COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: -- a system, a person?  
DR. STRAUCH: The -- it's the accumulation of every point (inaudible). So it's -- so, like, for every -- in the lake (inaudible), for example, every storm drain outfall, there is a permit for the accumulative impact of that.
