Derrick’s Well Drilling & Pump Services, LLC, Application for Well Construction and Pump Installation Permits, Wai Well (State Well No. 8-3802- 016), TMK (3) 1-6-141:024; Kea‘au Aquifer System Area, Hawai‘i
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Ryan Imata, Ground Water Regulation Branch Chief Staff requested that the Commission approve the application for both well and pump permits with a pump capacity of 450 gpm (0.096 mgd) for a water bottling plant.
I have a question for the applicant because there are some discrepancies in the application where there’s pump capacity at 450 GPM and expected use 0.096 million gallons per day, but later on in the cultural impact assessment the number 0.482 MGD. With a 450 GPM and if you’re running full-time, it’s .65 MGD, what’s the actual usage because we’re not in a designated area so there isn’t reporting but the pumps...
There is reporting.
Okay, but what’s the actual use because there are two different numbers presented.
After the pump test, under this new scheme, do you come back to the Commission to report or is your section delegated the authority to change the MGD based on your study?
That’s kind of uncharted water because this is the first one that we’re presenting to you. I see two ways to look at it, one way is you could delegate authority to the chair to approve the production of a pump installation permit to where there are no adverse impacts associated with it or you could require us to bring it back to the Commission. I can see it one of two ways. I was thinking about that as I was presenting the pump test and what’s the procedure. Again, this is the first time we’ve done it so I don’t know. It’s certainly up to you guys.
Then your rules, do your rules define adverse effect?
No, what we do look at is in our geologist analyzing the pump test, they’ll take the constant rate pump test and they’ll evaluate it to see if there are any what we call recharge boundaries. We plot the draw down of the well on a logarithmic graph. As a pump test goes on you’re going to see the water start reducing and then if all of a sudden the reduction of the water level just kind of slows down, you hit a recharge boundary. So are you starting to impact a stream or it’s starting to impact some other resource and that’s the avenue by which we might not at that point restrict the pump, but we might require more effort into figuring out what that is. One possible way, I don’t think that’s applicable here but one possible is requiring somebody to amend the instream flow standard if they’re impacting surface water. There are strategies that we employ to either reduce the pump capacity or have them apply mitigative components. I can tell you that I don’t think we’ve ever looked at a pump test and saw that. There might have been one like 25 years ago.
It’s just a math question. At 450 gallons a minute, how does that equate to the 0.096 million gallons per day?
It doesn’t. Normally the 0.096 is what they put on their application as what they think they’ll need. What we do is we always go and we multiply 450 gallons per minute x 60 x 24.
That’s a normal capacity.
We check what the maximum is and understand that if they’re going to pump 0.096, they might be pumping for two or three hours or something like. I think most wells don’t want to pump for 24 hours.
my experience is that once you start a well you don’t want to turn it off because restarting wells to get that inertia is very expensive. Anyway, that’s not my question, just the clarity in the math. Can you refresh my memory on the process of these permits? This seems like a pretty modest water usage in a non-water management area. Where is the demarcation between what you bring to the Commission versus something that you would handle as an administrative and that we can delegate to the chair? In all the impacts that you’ve described, it seems that there are resolutions that will not endanger the aquifer or the water resources in that area that we need to address as a commission. Kind of help me through what the evolution of this process is.
I’m actually eager to talk about that. The Commission had a requirement to approve well and pump permits but as staff was presenting to the commission, the agendas were like super long because we had 10 or 12 wells coming before the Commission that were very routine and have very minimal potential impacts for the resource, quantity wise. In an effort to delegate authority to the chair to approve those permits, we developed the Hawaii Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards in 1997. Through the adoption of the well standards, it was determined that if a well complies with all of those standards, those standards are designed to make sure that there’s not going to be impacts on the environment. It’s not just from a pumping standpoint it’s also from the standpoint of if you drill a bore hole and you install a casing in there, is there adequate grout there to protect contaminant from coming down? The well standards are designed around much more than just pumping in and of itself, but pumpage is a big part of that. That’s why we require pump tests and that’s why we require staff to approve those pump tests prior to us finalizing and saying and endorsing the pump size that’s installed. Fast forward to December of last year and the Commission made a decision to instead of delegating authority to the chair to approve all permits, the decision was made for anything that was not an individual domestic well to come to the Commission even if it complied with the Hawaii Well Construction and Pump Installation Standards. That’s where we are today. I can opine but that’s certainly not within my capacity.
I think that’s for this side of the table but thank you.
I have a technical one. Since we’re learning about these details, can you explain how a step draw down test tells you different things than a constantly? How does it work?
I’m not the best at understanding the step draw down test, but basically it’s a step draw down test but it’s actually increasing, it’s not decreasing the pumping rate. You have to have a variable speed on the pump, so you throttle it down. I’ve seen a pump test where he actually throttled it down with the valve and you can imagine valving off a pressure that’s pumping like 500 GPM. The whole assembly was shaking. There are variable speed pumps that you can put in to vary the rate or you can throttle down a permanent pump that can only run at one rate. The drillers here, they can expand on that too. Basically, looking at three discrete pump rates allows us to establish or determine certain aquifer properties and I can’t tell you technically how that’s done but we can determine like transmissivity and storage values which are data points that we put into our database so that we can understand the aquifer. The step draw down test really is for us to understand aquifer properties, whereas the constant rate test is looking more at the production or the productivity of the well and the impacts to salinity draw down. Roy Hardy is probably watching.
More questions for an offline science conversation already for me.
Just to make it clear on this pump rates of 450 gallons per minute, you should put the total pump capacity, which is probably like 0.6 MGD, then in a separate statement saying that the applicant tends to use 96,000 gallons per day or whatever it is.
I apologize.
No, I just kind of peaked my math skills on this.
On your nine-point checklist, I’m curious. We have an affirmative duty to protect the public trust and the way in which these are addressed in points 5 and 9 really focus on archaeology or historic structures. I think it kind of misses some of what has often come before us as traditional customary practices. In this case the applicant did a really nice job with their cultural impact survey, so that really helps us. Is there a way you can recognize that in your process? Like point 10, that they clearly articulate because we’ve seen applications that don’t and I think we want to incentivize that for applicants. If you want it to sail through, do your homework before. We don’t have the time to follow up on it but that they demonstrated they’ve given us information to feel good about approving or disapproving. That’s my only feedback to you.
Thank you for raising that and that aligns with some points that Chair Chang wanted me to make with respect to Ka Paʻakai Analysis. Feeling like the record needs to be strengthened so that we’re making decisions based on a record and so it needs to be explicit in that record, not implied or something that you could extrapolate or calculate what our findings are. With respect to the identification of valued cultural, historical, and natural resources in the project area including traditional customary Hawaiian rights, in addition to what’s indicated in the report, she wishes to add the fact that, for the record, in addition to publishing a notice, staff also reviewed or the applicant also reviewed Kepa Maly’s report identifying resources along the coast of Keaʻau but none in the project area. The project area was formerly pasture land for cattle and therefore subject to grazing and excavation for the slaughter house. She’d like that language specifically inserted into the record. Secondly, with respect to the extent to which those resources will be impacted or impaired by the proposed project, we have a finding based upon the CIA(Cultural Impact Statement), based upon the record that’s there, there were no identified impacts of the proposed project on traditional customary practices. That’s the second point Chair would like to make explicit. Finally, in terms of any feasible action that should be taken based upon the CIA, there appears to be no feasible action that should be taken by WC, the applicant, in granting the water permit. It’s left there for us to conclude and the chair would like that those conclusions to be really explicit in the record.
So, clarification, she wants those statements made by staff in our submittal?
Yes, after you looked at the CIA and so forth, these are your explicit findings.
Got it, so I think that what we’re providing here are the answers from the applicant, but we need to make definitive statements in terms...
Based upon the record of the applicant, this is what we conclude. I think it’s a matter of a normal process and rigor that you would like in addressing our Ka Paʻakai Analysis.
This is in a water management area? 
No.
Now that’s my issue and also with the Ota Well. My understanding is in an area governed by the common law, the Commission has permit authority over well construction and pump installation but it has doesn’t have authority for water use permit. On the other hand, it seems to me that in both this case and the Ota case we’re actually going step by step even though it’s not called a permit, putting such conditions on the water use that it is becoming a permit. I want to know for example in this case, what kinds of requirements are you having on how much water is actually being drawn because besides not being a permit, it is still a public trust resource and the use should be reasonable and necessary. But how do we make a distinction between deciding on the water use in a permit in a water management area, in a non-water management area?
That’s a question for me? I will just say that in a non-management area one would have correlative rights and I think that on the one hand, we need to assure that people are not wasting water to address what you said. You can’t waste water, but at the same time if you’re in a non-management area and the Commission doesn’t issue allocations and require somebody to show that their use is reasonable and beneficial, then what’s the regulatory mechanism to require someone reduce their pumpage to a certain use? We’re in this regulatory, nebulous region where we don’t have an allocation. It’s my thought that in a non-management area, someone can change their use tomorrow to use it for pasture irrigation or something else. There’s no establishment of what a reasonable and beneficial use is. I think it’s a hard thing in a non-management area. The other way is that designated as a management area, you can control what people are using it for as reasonable and beneficial uses.
What I’m a little disturbed about is that what happens then in a non-water management area. Really the only people that legally speaking would be harmed were other people that have water rights under the common law. You have to watch out about that but we don’t have any direct way to make sure that it’s reasonable and necessary. Remember, the original legislative proposal was to make the entire state a water management area and the compromise was the situation we have now. I’ve always been disturbed about how the hell we deal with water in non-management areas and in the past you just said, okay we’re going to do it through a well construction and pump insulation permit, but after that you really can’t say anything about how much water they’re going to be using because you don’t really know. That’s why I asked the question of how are we dealing with wells in these kinds of situations. In the surface water area, at least we have interim instream flow standards which can limit how much water, you can’t dewater the stream, but in this particular case we don’t have anything that says you can’t go beyond even what would be endangering to the aquifer. I remember the ʻĪao aquifer system where we were at 100% and we still weren’t designating it, which I thought was kind of a crazy situation at that time. Anyway, maybe we can discuss this more with the later discussion on the Ota, which by the way I tried to find information on what the hell the Ota Well is and I can’t find anything on that issue.
Did you want to respond to Commissioner Miike or Dean? Did you want to respond further, this nebulous area?
I would almost equate instream flow standards as sustainable yield, too. We have two regulatory mechanisms to make sure there’s no harm. Number one, there’s the pump test and despite the fact that they can change the use tomorrow, they can’t increase the pump from 450 to 500 GPM without coming back to the commission. So based on the pump test we should understand what 450 gallon per minute impact is going to have...
Hang on for a second, let me ask you a question. You said that if they decided to up the pumpage, they can’t do it before coming back to the commission, but what criteria would you have to deny that under a non-water management area? What can you do to say you can’t do that?
Requiring them to run another pump test that is in compliance with the standard.
But as long as the pump test and everything else is okay, you can’t really stop them can you?
That would meet the second factor is that once you get up to close to sustainable yield, you could designate and then like what happened in Lahaina, now it’s designated and now everybody that was using a certain quantity of water now has to prove that it’s reasonable and beneficial. I’m not saying it’s correct, but I’m saying that the establishment of reasonable and beneficial use happens at the point where the aquifer is pushed to the extent of sustainable yield.
But that’s my problem. Up to that point, you can’t do anything. You got to wait till they start endangering the aquifer before you can act.
Right, but there’s two parts to it. There’s the pump capacity and there’s a reasonable and beneficial component. On the one hand, we have no ability to establish whether a use is reasonable and beneficial, but we can definitely limit the pump capacity and that to me is going to have the impacts on the resource regardless of what the reasonable and beneficial use is. Someone could say that water bottling for a million gallons per day is reasonable and beneficial but that might have impacts on the aquifer and so we restrict the pump capacity as the protection of the aquifer. Does that make sense?
But you’re still not able to in a particular well put a limit on it as long as the aquifer is not in danger. That’s a discussion for another time, but it’s always bothered me that we have limited authority in a non-water management area but we seem to be creeping toward a permit system in a non-water management area.
Maybe a thought and a suggestion and idea, you probably have a lot of data from various pump tests. Has anyone in staff ever worked to put that data together to do some modeling and then anticipate? You can ramp it up, if everybody had their pumps at max versus if they had it at 75 and you could run simulations to see. That’s maybe not within the staff’s but partnering with USGS or partnering with to anticipate that kind of stuff and help come back. Every single well might be okay but we might be depleting discharge in the nearshore fisheries. No individual well owner has the capacity or knowledge or skills to do that, but it is our responsibility so maybe that’s something, an extended discussion. We have data, we need to make use of it and use it to inform. You’re smiling and nodding, you’ve had this conversation.
As a matter of fact, the one thing that we are sorely lacking within Groundwater Regulation Branch or what I’m proposing to reorganize the groundwater branch is that particular expertise. My intent is to convert my hydrologist into a groundwater analyst so that we can put all this data together and somebody can manage contracts with GS or partner to implement groundwater modeling based on what you’re saying. I’m kind of anticipating that. As of right now we don’t have the capacity of staff to really even drive the discussion. Roy had modeling experience but we don’t have that experience.
It exists so whoever is listening, it exists.
I definitely want to go in that direction.
I think to help with Larry’s point of view, when we have a 450 gallon per minute pump rather than recognizing what the intended use is at 0.96 MGD, you should really put in the full pump capacity and use that as your benchmark for the allocation. What the applicant wants to do or wants to use, it’s up to them, but then again you have a cap on it that they cannot exceed on a 24-hour period. Going back to a sustainable yield calculation, if all the pumps are turned on every day for 24 hours a day.
My name is Joshua Delary, I’m the director of production and engineering for Waiakea Water.
I’m Jay Malloe, I’m director of quality at Waiakea Water.
We are here representing Waiakea Water. Thank you, I actually got really intrigued with all your questions and a lot of things that we do that we actually like to be involved in, that aspect as well as testing samples, stuff like that. This permit is for us to drill a new well for our facility adjacent to our other two wells there.
What’s the expected per day usage because there’s some very different numbers?
Yes, there is very different numbers. The numbers that we utilize, we actually track every drop that comes out of the ground. We have flow meters on all of our pumps, our well technicians, our staff there at the well record every fill going into our tanker. Every drop that is taken out is recorded through our flow meter. The current usage that we’re doing, it’s about 18 minutes to fill. It’s got an 18-minute run time on our pump and that’s for 6,000 gallons, so it’s not a constant 24-hour run time.
That’s where the 96,000 gallons per day comes from. Then there was a 482,000 gallons per day number in the cultural EIS. Was that for the whole facility?
I think that was probably for the whole, I’m not 100% sure on that.
That number is way too high compared to what you folks are anticipating?
Yeah.
I just wanted that clarification, thank you.
Aloha mai kākou, for the record my name is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer. I’m testifying in my individual capacity on this particular item. To start off, I really have no particular concern with this proposed well, but I want to just respond to some of the dialogue between Ryan Imata and Commissioner Miike because Commissioner Miike was offering some really thoughtful questions about the limitations of the commission’s powers in non-designated areas. I just want to give some response to some of the things Ryan said because I think it’s really important for the Commission to understand this in relationship to this agenda item, the upcoming Ota Well item and other things. There was an assertion, if I heard it correctly, that two ways in which public trust and other interests in water are protected in non-designated areas are through the management of sustainable yield and through the use of pumps. I just want to be really clear and this has been an area of scholarship of mine, first of all five-day pump tests or four-day pump tests are not designed to assess impacts on public trust resources. If the well is far from the coast or from a stream or another resource that you’re caring about, you very well will have long-term impacts on a public trust resource and it’s not going to be detectable by a 5-day pump test. A 5-day pump test will detect potentially, if there’s no geological blocking that impacts on nearby wells. Secondly, just to be really clear the way the Water Commission has set sustainable yields, it’s actually not analogous to how instream flow standards are set, it’s actually the opposite because you set instream flow standards by first determining the minimum amount of water that’s needed to protect public trust resources in the stream. The way the State, the Water Commission has chosen to set sustainable yields is actually to determine the maximum amount of water you think you can extract. It actually starts rather than a precautionary approach, with an extractive approach and to be really clear sustainable yield is not designed to protect public trust resources. You can pump all you want from Launiupoko or the Honokowai aquifers below sustainable yield and not restore important public trust resources like Mokuhinia. You can completely harm fish ponds, anchialine pools, the nearshore environment at pumping rates far below sustainability. It has to do with where the well location is, how deep the well is, and how much it’s pumping. In terms of as you figure out your process for what’s delegated, not delegated and how you consider non-delegated permits and non-designated water management areas, I just think you need to keep in mind you can’t rely on pump tests and sustainable yield as any assurance that you’re fulfilling your duties in terms of protecting public trust resources. I feel very strongly about it, sorry if my tone was a little strident on this one, but it is something that I [inaudible] you guys have come to a conclusion. I’m happy to answer any questions, thank you for listening.
Just to answer Jonathan, sustainable yield is whatever the Commission decides is sustainable yield so he does have a valid point which is that it’s not just based on the science of how much water you can draw out of it, but also the effects on other things. We’ve always stuck to more or less a quantitative approach. I don’t know how you deal with trying to put in other factors, but Jonathan does have a good point.
I would suggest that we discuss the topic more thoroughly in executive session at some point in the future.
Would you like to go in now?
I don’t think it needs to happen right now, this is a larger issue.
You wanted to view all of these permits.
Let me be clear about that. When I came on board, it was with respect to delegation, I felt that the Commission makes policy and the Commission should be aware of what’s being delegated. I did ask staff to inventory for me all of the delegation authorities, what has been delegated and their reliance on a 1997 action was outdated. I think it did require um a more thorough review given the changes both in law and in facts and in the situation of water. We have Ka Paʻakai Analysis that we utilize, we have the environmental considerations, we have a much more engaged community; therefore, for me I did have some concerns about what should be delegated and what should be administrative or ministerial. I wanted that to come before the Commission for guidance, so I am not wetted in stone that everything should come before the commission. In the past we talked about many of those water well permits dealing with Hawaiian Paradise domestic use. Their usage is actually very small, it’s necessary, therefore domestic use to me. That’s a category I think the Commission can make, a decision that can be delegated to the chair and delegated to the first deputy. When we were talking about the Hāpuna well, there were comments about how should we address that so I am more looking for guidance...
Can we try to stick to the item?
Fair enough, I just wanted to explain myself. Back to the agenda item.
I think the applicant, I appreciated the job that they did on the cultural impact assessment and I would like us to keep on that in the future.
I do think it is important that the Commission makes specific findings, I do believe that is what the court has required us to do on actions. I went through all the documents and I did appreciate that the cultural impact assessment was prepared which gave me the facts upon which...but I do believe that is the commission’s obligation to do that.
