Approval of Surface Water Use Permit Application (SWUP.5880.6) for New Use and Special Conditions, Wesley and Jodie Mundy for 153,125 gpd; and Find that Amendment to SWUP.2157.6 issued to the Wailuku Water Company is Not Required; Waihe‘e Stream, Waihe‘e Surface Water Management Area, Maui, TMK: (2) 3-2-017:042
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Dean Uyeno Staff stated the Surface Water Use Permit Application should be approved for new uses to Wesley and Jodie Mundy for kalo and diversified agriculture. The use for kalo cultivation is considered under the priority for the exercise of traditional and cultural practices. The requested amount of water is reasonable and beneficial and can be accommodated within the allocated amount for off stream uses by permitted users across the Waihe‘e, Waiehu, ‘Īao and Waikapū surface water management areas.
Aloha everyone. My full name is Jodie Nihimaile Mundy. My maiden name is Iwamasa. My father, Thomas Iwamasa, was half-Japanese and half-Hawaiian. My grandmother, Lilian Kikala, was full Hawaiian. My family’s property in Wai‘ehu was passed from my grandmother to my father in 1974, located on Mala‘ihi Road, less than a mile from my property which I purchased on April 2021, the subject of this permit application. From my grandmother’s garden and lo‘is to the hills above Wai‘ehu, our neighbors farmed produce like bananas and kalo. I recall the properties at the top of Mala‘ihi Road having cultivated lo‘is to include the property that I now own. I’m connected to Wai‘ehu through my father and grandmother. Approval of this service water use permit will allow me and my family to cultivate the part of Mala‘ihi Road again. Mahalo.
Aloha Chair and Commissioners, thank you again for the opportunity for me to provide some quick testimony. Hōkūao Pellegrino, President of Hui o Nā Wai ʻEhā. As I mentioned in our August meeting on this particular item that Hui o Nā Wai ‘Ehā is in full support of the Mundy ‘ohana and their commitment to growing kalo and to restoring their ancestral kuleana land. We very much appreciate the Commission, the Commission staff, interim director Dean for their swift action. And thank you as well, Chair, for holding true to ensuring that we were able to get the answers that were needed in that one-month period. We very much appreciate that. We also support the staff submittal and recommendations to allocating the water for the Mundys. Thank you again and I’ll be here for any questions if need be. Mahalo.
Thank you very much. I see Michele Ho‘opi‘i. Did you want to provide any testimony on this item?
Aloha, Chair Chang and Commissioners and staff. My name is Michele Ho‘opi‘i and I am testifying in support of Jodie and Wes’ application, specifically for their traditional and customary rights. Their family is and has been a long-time family on Mala‘ihi Road. I know that Jodie’s tutus do go back as far as the 1800s and they have practiced taro farming. I support their application. Give them water so that they can continue their traditional and customary practices. Mahalo.
Thank you very much. I see Avery Chumbley and James Geiger. Did you want to provide any testimony or comments?
Yes I do, Chair. Chair Chang and Commissioners, thanks for the opportunity to provide both written and oral comments on both B-3 and B-4. Our comments are similar on the pair of the two. My name is Avery Chumbley. I’m the President of Wailuku Water Company. And as I stated back in August, these are the first two SWUPAs that will be delivered off of the Wailuku system since the June 2021 D&O was issued. The other previous three came directly off of the river. We do not object, as we said in August, to the quantities being proposed to the allocation in both of these SWUPAs but Chair we do disagree with the staff submittal that these permit holders would not violate the PUC order as we understand it. In the Ramseyer format on both page 15 and 20 of both submittals, the statement says these SWUPA holders would be a user and not a customer and could not violate the January 9, 2009 PUC order. We still continue to disagree with that, Chair and to that extent, I’d like to ask Jim Geiger to expand on that issue. And also we have Doug Codiga with us today who is our PUC attorney who can provide the additional comments on specifically on those issues.
Good afternoon, Chair and Commissioners. Jim Geiger on behalf of Wailuku Water Company. I want to thank you for your attention; I know it’s been a very long day. You’ve heard a lot of testimonies, so I will try to keep my remarks short. We read the staff report in their meeting with the PUC as addressing only our amended application that was filed last May, May of 2022. We don’t read it as having addressed the Suspension Order that was issued in 2009. And in particular in the Suspension Order, it starts out stating, the status quo shall be maintained and applicants and their affiliates are prohibited from adding any new customers. At that time, Wailuku Water Company didn’t have a category of “users.” We only had a category of customers. And so based upon what was before the PUC at that time, we understand that to include everyone. If we had anyone new, we are not maintaining the status quo and therefore we would be in violation of the PUC suspense order. We’ve asked for the suspense order to be lifted for some time. The PUC has not taken action. If the Commission proceeds forward, we fully expect them filing a motion to specifically lift the suspense order as to the two permit applications that are before it today. We don’t know exactly how long it would take, but we would expect that to happen. For clarification purposes, we could ask for a special condition to be added that states that the permits would be conditioned on the issuance of the lifting of the suspense order from the PUC. We think as a compromise position, simply modifying the standard condition #3, as in our written submittal, to add at the end, “including compliance with the applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Public Utilities Commission” will suffice. And with that, I will stop my comments and be able to respond to any questions you may have.
Mr. Codiga, did you want to add anything? Doug? 
Nothing further to add, Chair. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Do I have anybody else on Zoom who wants to provide comments on this matter?
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon, it’s almost evening.
So it is. Good evening Chair Chang, Commissioners. Like everyone else, I was here for C-1 so I’ll stay on for that but having heard this matter and being a long-time legal practitioner before of course this Commission as well as the Public Utilities Commission, it definitely piqued my interest. I just want to be clear on what was proposed by Wailuku Water Company because I believe they were raising the PUC as potentially as a barrier to the Commission, this Commission issuing a permit. And I heard them proposing some kind of condition on the permit, subject to PUC approval or something like that, but I thought I heard from Dean’s staff presentation that the PUC already signed off on this. As far as they’re concerned, this is not a customer and they’re a user and that, of course, aligns with this Commissions understanding of the kuleana right holders or users on this system where they have a right to the water flowing to this ditch system. They’re not customers of this water company. What I’m hearing is that the Commission understands that, going back to their orders in this case. The PUC understands that and said so in so many words to the Commission staff Acting Deputy. So, what’s the problem here? Let’s just move forward, right? If you have any questions, again because of my decades of experience at least collectively on both these Commissions, please feel free to ask. I thought there’s no problem here.
Appreciate the free legal advice.
I was going to ask Dean, but what’s the problem with their additional language? It just says it’ll be, if the PUC changes its mind or something, they’re insulated.
Was it that simple as just subject to PUC jurisdiction or whatever?
What we believe to be PUC’s determination is that matters of water allocation are ours. And if we tell them they have water to allocate, that doesn’t create a harm to Avery folks. So?
Sorry, is that the...
Well, I think there were two separate...what I heard Wailuku say. First, I heard one condition being it was subject to PUC lifting, but then I also heard. I would agree. That one made me uncomfortable, but the second one was by Mr. Geiger saying, just comply with our terms and conditions of peace.
If that’s just some boilerplate provision, you’re just saying the sky is blue, fine. But I heard what you heard as well, which is let’s go through another round of this with the PUC, clarify the distinction between customer and user, no.
That’s what I heard, that there were two different proposed conditions. One was subject to PUC lifting the condition and then the second one Mr. Geiger said, as a compromise why don’t we just say you comply with all PUC orders, which we are. We are complying with the order.
Thank you.
Did you hear Mr. Meyer? He said, “Who should I send the bill to?” Who are you going to send the bill to?
As you know, we work pro-bono.
This is what we appreciate. This collective together, finding a solution. Questions anyone?
Chair, I’d like to ask either Jim or Doug to opine on that and clarify because what I’m hearing is several different things and I think that they can bring some clarity to what was just debated.
Mr. Geiger, what I heard you say, there was the one condition which was subject to PUC lifting versus you said as a compromise that they comply with all the PUC conditions. Could you just clarify that?
That’s correct, Chair. We could’ve asked for something, a condition being put on here that it was subject to the PUC lifting of the stay. We thought it was probably, accomplish the same thing by adding just that, comply with all rules, orders, and regulations.
When we submitted our permit, it did not stipulate that we had to do any PUC requirements.
Yeah, okay, okay. While you’re here, do you want to add to the conversation?
Now I’m hearing the further explanation, even that language makes me uncomfortable. It might put the onus on these right holders to have to wait while Wailuku Water Company says, you have no right until you go to the PUC get some declaratory action or something like that, you know? Look, just because we’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re out to get us, but we’ve been doing this stuff for Nā Wai ‘Ehā for twenty years and we’ve seen a lot of rigmarole. Let’s just cut through all of this. PUC has spoken clearly, right? This Commission has spoken clearly. These are not customers, period.
Let me ask you, if we get sued by Mr. Chumbley, will you defend us?
Absolutely, as friends. You might be aware, this is public information, that this shibai about the Water Commission has to defer to the Public Utilities Commission is an issue that the water company has raised on appeal on Nā Wai ‘Ehā case. They’re going to lose.
Okay, we’ll bring this back to order. Thank you very much, I appreciate the additional commentary here.
If they want to sue, that’s what you have deputy attorney generals for and this issue is tee’d up in other forums for a legal ruling. This is no reason to put these people through further delay and headaches. They asked for a permit, they’re right holders. They should get it. And they’re not customers.
Chair, it’s not the applicant that this decision is putting to risk. What you’re putting to risk is Wailuku Water Company and its operation in its entirety to all of the people who get water through our system.
Aloha mai kākou, I’m Vicky Holt Takamine. I’m a Native Hawaiian activist. I now have a new title, vigil aunty. My question is, is Wailuku Land Company a traditional customary practitioner? Do they comply with giving water back to where it came from? According to our kānāwai, traditional land use, and water use. If you take water out, you have to bring it back to the system in the same condition so people down the way can use the water. Farmers, fisherman, all the natural...are they complying to that? Or do they just suck off the water for their own use? These are Native Hawaiian traditional customary practitioners who want to continue kalo farming, who have a right to that water. Wailuku doesn’t own it. You don’t own that water. It’s not yours. You need to share like we have shared with everybody that comes. You don’t have any rights to that. Period.
I appreciate the manaʻo. Do I have anybody else?
Chair, I just get one question. I wasn’t going to stand up, but all this...
This is the third person who told me, I wasn’t going testify, but you come up.
I’m drowning in all this water. Bottom line is, I like know what year Wailuku Water Company took over the water because it sounds like this family goes to the 1800s. Was Wailuku Water Company in the 1800s?
You can ask us and we can ask them.
Ok ask them because I don’t know. Because if they’re not then, they’re not even listening to what your staff just said? The PUC, they’re not customers. I mean come on, I graduated Campbell backdoor, but I understand. I understand what was just said. It’s clear as day. The only thing they’re muttering is it’s their water. Now this one’s clear. Thank you, Chair.
I appreciate that. With that being said, Commissioners...
It sounds like basically this. This is my little one’s when we started, when all of this started, when we were awakened in 2019. Whether it’s ʻāina, whether it’s wai, whether it’s ‘iwi kupuna, it’s the same thing. It seems to me that when you have either a little one or generational families, what we’re hearing right now, the families who want to go back and practice their culture, they have the right to do so. Yet as soon as you put this on, different dress, different motives, and then you get this added in. When you have this here, whether it’s hidden kind of there so those who are in front can see. Whether you come with it in here, pocket, side pocket, envelope, whatever it comes in. It seems that this, what we continue to see, this over this. When it should be this way around. And that’s all I wanted to say.
I do want to make an addition to the staff submittal. I would like to add a recommendation #5, that the board find that Jodie Mundy has established that her family has lived on the ridge of Malaʻihi Road in Wai‘ehu ahupuaʻa for more than three generations where her family has cultivated kalo and the practice was handed down from her grandparents. Additionally, she has provided information that her planned use is not for commercial purposes, therefore she has established a traditional customary practice. In addition, Michele Ho‘opi‘i, who is also exercising traditional customary practices has also provided supportive, factual testimony to support Jodie Mundy’s assertion that she is exercising traditional customary practices. I would just want to add that to the staff’s recommendations.
MOTION: (HO / HANNAHS) To approve staff submittal as amended. UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED (MIIKE/KATAYAMA/HANNAHS/CHANG/MEYER/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/HO)
