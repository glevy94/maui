was happy to hear this thing - is this rulemaking - because this is going to affect everyone, especially when you're delegating with these exceptions. The first exception I can tell you - 1A, all that penetrate to discrete water bodies. That happens a lot everywhere, almost. Almost all the wells on Kaua'i that happen, it's an old island so there's a lot of layers of low permeability where you run through and there are a lot of perched aquifers, confined aquifers. In East Maui, there's lots of perched aquifers. On the Big Island, Keauhou, there's lots as well. Overall, this seems like if you're going to make these kind of distinctions and exceptions, it really sounds more like an update to the Construction Standards themselves. If that's what's being sought here, if there's special cases so kind of a rulemaking thing. I would agree with what was discussed that maybe the AG should weigh in, sorry Colin, about whether this approach really is rulemaking. Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani brought up Keauhou and all these conditions. Well, that's a special case because of the non-designation, so that's not really rulemaking. I think the first condition she read out was this collaborating, talking with ‘Aha Moku and bringing construction permits and pump installation permits in the non-designated area if conditions that were discussed were not agreeable to the applicant. You actually had an example of that and that's why that special condition was put into the non-designation proceedings and accepted by the Commission of the Kohanaiki project which is right next door to the national park. Just through the regular process, the delegated process and discussing the applications, what came to be agreed upon by all the parties was, hey, put they've provided very good information which actually helped with the designation proceedings, as well. That was just codifying that special situation in Keauhou and especially with the interest in designation. I don't think that's a rule, it's just, here's this special place that there's a lot of concern and able to arrive at reasonable accommodations and conditions with the applicants and the people of that place. Again, I think my time is used up here but I do like the question - is this overall approach rulemaking or not? That's kind of my question, thank you.  

ANDREW CHOY, DHHL: Aloha Commissioners, Andrew Choy with the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL). The Department appreciates the opportunity to provide testimony on these items or this particular agenda item. First off, the Department was not consulted on this matter. We appreciate the importance the role that the Department of Water Supply’s have in water development and delivery in Hawai‘i and are glad that they were considered. The Department is both a water purveyor and public trust use of water, we however, were not consulted. We were aware of the agenda item when the agenda was posted and had access to the submittal on Monday which was also our Commission meeting. As Ryan acknowledged in his presentation, he did reach out to Dr. Scheuer over the weekend, but it wasn't really sufficient time for us to really digest this submittal and process its implications on the Department's ability to provide water to its beneficiaries. CWRM staff conversely worked hand-in-hand with us well over a month on another agenda item on your agenda today, so it can be done to reach out to the Department in advance, well in advance of this presentation. Also, secondly on transparency for DHHL
