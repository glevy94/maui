action plans that you've just described.

DIRECTOR STUFFLEBEAN: Right, yeah, that is the case. I'll probably -- I think I will defer to Eva for that in terms of the -- the quantitative connection to the plan because she's much more familiar with it than I am, having worked on it for -- for many years.

So, Eva, I'll let you -- let you tackle that one if you don't mind.

CHAIR CHANG: Go ahead. Eva, go ahead.

MS. BLUMENSTEIN: Mahalo, Chair. Yeah, in response to the commissioner's question, yes, there are quantified targets for each strategy, in fact, that relates to resource use. So in terms of recycled water, you -- you have the demand and supply projected through year 2035, so in terms of targeting buildout of R1 or other recycled water use, or whether it's groundwater development or conservation targets, you have those quantified, you know, in five-year increments.

And then the strategies kind of have the short- to long-term implementation range. Some of these projects will be, you know, further scoped out over a very long time, and some of them, like the director mentioned, are already in the works. So, yeah, so there are targets in there that we are working through tracking in the implementation matrix so we can report progress to our board and council and to you folks.

DIRECTOR STUFFLEBEAN: And I'll only add to that
