"(686.32, 692.08)", that we addressed them sufficiently so that we could come to you today with recommendations and,686.32,692.08
"(692.72, 697.2)", an item that you felt comfortable improving knowing that we had done our due diligence,692.72,697.2
"(697.2, 701.76)", and additional outreach so some of the recommendations you see have been tweaked,697.2,701.76
"(701.76, 707.0)", slightly based on those conversations with certain stakeholders and the county.,701.76,707.0
"(707.0, 729.52)"," I guess at this time I would just say that staff believes that the the planet itself meets all the statutory requirements that work in the State water code, and it sufficiently addresses the recommended elements in the hawaiian water plan framework pertaining to updates county water use and development plans so we feel that the plan you see today",707.0,729.52
"(729.52, 736.08)", is sufficient and meets every other requirements needed to be approved i will reiterate the,729.52,736.08
"(736.08, 741.92)", recommendation so we have that on record staff recommends that the commission adopt the maui,736.08,741.92

"(841.76, 843.44)"," And with that, I will hand over",841.76,843.44
"(843.44, 845.0)", to any questions you have.,843.44,845.0
"(845.0, 848.0)"," Commissioner, do you have any questions for Stel?",845.0,848.0
"(848.0, 854.0)", Maybe a quick recommendation. Your recommendation three is all encompassing.,848.0,854.0
"(854.0, 868.8)", You might want to at least recognize this soon to be formed East Maui water or something just to just to make sure that we're aware of what's going on because that probably includes three or four of these annual meetings yes absolutely and that was something that was,854.0,868.8
"(868.8, 872.0)", discussed during public testimony and in conversations with the county,868.8,872.0
"(874.96, 908.72)"," oh sorry a question on recommendation five which focused on working with Maui Dws to support development of their water conservation programs and given my Dws is like one of several providers, you know how to say when you say island water conservation yes absolutely so the water audits",874.96,908.72
"(908.72, 914.8)", themselves include more than just the pws systems but um i think that's some good feedback that,908.72,914.8
"(915.6, 920.0)", itself is only referring to non-pws so if that's something you want to amend,915.6,920.0
"(920.64, 932.0)"," yeah we can definitely do that okay i will say that the the water audits, especially in the area are being used as part of our assessment of the water use from an application.",920.64,932.0
"(932.0, 945.44)"," So we're trying to understand where the efficiencies can be made, not just in the public, but in the private systems as well. yeah so i mean yeah i was going to have to propose it a bit just change it from there to island",932.0,945.44
"(949.84, 955.36)", yes katie the submittal is really clear that this fulfills a statutory obligation that we have to,949.84,955.36
"(955.36, 969.36)", have a plan uh how does this strengthen our water management these will be the county alone that's a good question so these plans themselves,955.36,969.36
"(969.36, 975.2)", obviously as you know are often imperfect it takes many years to write them so they're never going to,969.36,975.2
"(975.2, 979.76)", be perfect when you present them to the commission that's why we try to approach them as living,975.2,979.76
"(979.76, 991.44)", documents where they can be refined and updated as needed. I'd probably refer to the county and the implementation plan for specifics on how this will be used,979.76,991.44
"(991.44, 997.08)", to move Maui County forward in terms of their water development and water resource protection,991.44,997.08
"(997.08, 1003.5)"," initiatives, but that's also part of the exhibit that you see here.",997.08,1003.5
"(1003.5, 1006.64)", I think one of the important points to keep in mind is that this,1003.5,1006.64
"(1006.64, 1012.56)", plan was developed in accordance with the old Hawaii water plan framework from 2000 and we are,1006.64,1012.56
"(1012.56, 1019.84)", in the process of updating that framework and so we hope to consider a lot of other issues cultural,1012.56,1019.84
"(1019.84, 1030.0)"," issues that aren't specifically maybe brought out or explicit in the existing plans that you see coming before you, but it's something that we want to incorporate into future updates.",1019.84,1030.0
"(1032.0, 1034.04)", A huge component that is often missing.,1032.0,1034.04
"(1036.02, 1049.84)"," Thank you, and I'll wait to hear more from Maui, Maui officials. so please okay oh go ahead item one is there a due date for that summary so it's in process now",1036.02,1049.84
"(1049.84, 1054.56)", but i can let you the comment more specifically on where they're at but i believe it's in process,1049.84,1054.56
"(1054.56, 1067.0)"," and they should have it done within the next six to nine months thank you my question my only My question is, what is the impact if we don't approve this plan?",1054.56,1067.0
"(1067.0, 1077.0)", Your question was already being used by the county for a lot of their capital projects and planning efforts.,1067.0,1077.0
"(1077.0, 1086.24)", So we do not approve it. I believe there's so many ways in some way um to guide their process and what and,1077.0,1086.24
"(1086.24, 1092.8)", what they want to achieve with a lot of resource protection on the island um again deferred,1086.24,1092.8
"(1092.8, 1098.0)", probably to the county to provide more specific information about how not approving this plan,1092.8,1098.0
"(1098.0, 1106.24)", when it would impact them i know that they've worked very hard many years to get to this point um i know that it's been a long process and,1098.0,1106.24
"(1106.24, 1112.56)", not all studies have been satisfied um unfortunately i think that's just how it goes sometimes,1106.24,1112.56
"(1112.56, 1119.6)", when you do outreach over many many years um but yeah i think the county might be able to,1112.56,1119.6
"(1119.6, 1125.12)", comment a bit more about what impacts specifically not adopting the plan will happen okay,1119.6,1125.12
"(1126.72, 1133.44)", um if there are no other questions i'm going to invite the county to provide us comments,1126.72,1133.44
"(1138.4, 1145.84)", council member shane senasi would you like to um speak first,1138.4,1145.84

"(1157.28, 1171.0)"," aloha happy to be here in support of the commission's recommendations uh we are supportive of the commission creating a summary of the report and also we support having regular updates made to the plan, including the Board of Water Supply and the Council's input.",1157.28,1171.0
"(1171.0, 1177.0)", This will be important for community outreach and and just general awareness.,1171.0,1177.0
"(1177.0, 1186.36)"," We've heard loud and clear from the community that they want to see up to date data within the plan, And I'm supportive of having the Department of Water Supply",1177.0,1186.36
"(1186.36, 1188.72)", update those numbers over time.,1186.36,1188.72
"(1188.72, 1191.66)"," So again, we just wanted to express our mahalo.",1188.72,1191.66
"(1192.62, 1195.78)"," And for your consideration of this plan,",1192.62,1195.78
"(1196.64, 1200.0)"," as Katie said, it has been a monumental task",1196.64,1200.0
"(1200.0, 1201.96)", over the last couple of years.,1200.0,1201.96
"(1201.96, 1204.4)", And many stakeholders were involved in the process.,1201.96,1204.4
"(1204.4, 1208.26)"," And so, and again, mahalo for coming to our communities",1204.4,1208.26
"(1208.26, 1209.76)", and hearing their concerns.,1208.26,1209.76
"(1209.76, 1210.58)", Thank you.,1209.76,1210.58
"(1213.12, 1214.24)"," Council members, commissioners,",1213.12,1214.24
"(1214.24, 1216.04)", do you have any questions for Shane?,1214.24,1216.04
"(1217.18, 1219.7)"," Shane, I just had a clarification.",1217.18,1219.7
"(1219.7, 1223.76)"," In what you, your comments this morning was",1219.7,1223.76
"(1223.76, 1227.24)"," that the commission will provide a summary,",1223.76,1227.24
"(1227.24, 1230.7)", is that that's the Maui.,1227.24,1230.7
"(1230.7, 1234.48)"," It's not, you're not looking at the water commission staff",1230.7,1234.48
"(1234.48, 1236.0)"," to do the summary, right?",1234.48,1236.0
"(1236.0, 1237.16)"," Yeah, we're correct.",1236.0,1237.16
"(1237.16, 1239.74)", We were just supportive of the permissions recommendations.,1237.16,1239.74
"(1239.74, 1241.7)"," Okay, okay, very good, very good.",1239.74,1241.7
"(1241.7, 1242.54)", Thank you.,1241.7,1242.54
"(1244.34, 1246.8)", No other questions i have uh,1244.34,1246.8
"(1247.84, 1253.68)", director john stuffelby maui county department of water supply,1247.84,1253.68
"(1255.44, 1262.56)", hello virtually um again john stubblebean i've been the director since january so i'm,1255.44,1262.56
"(1262.56, 1270.0)", i'm new here um and i understand that there were many concerns and opposing testimonies in adopting the plan.,1262.56,1270.0
"(1270.0, 1281.0)"," And I believe that the Commission deputy and his staff have worked diligently with with both the Department of Water Supply, County staff and community members to address these concerns.",1270.0,1281.0
"(1281.0, 1285.52)", So you know i've read through the plan and I found that it reflects many of kind,1281.0,1285.52
"(1285.52, 1292.12)", of the department goals and is guiding us in the right direction um and it it spells out strategies,1285.52,1292.12
"(1292.12, 1297.58)", that both diversify our water supply work towards Solutions and work closer with other water,1292.12,1297.58
"(1297.58, 1302.68)", purveyors there are several other water purveyors on on Maui and with other county agencies to,1297.58,1302.68
"(1302.68, 1305.28)", consider all the resources and I want to just kind of,1302.68,1305.28
"(1305.28, 1309.78)", briefly go through a few of the things that we're working on now that that kind of came out of the,1305.28,1309.78
"(1309.78, 1315.18)", plan that are you know basically implementing the plan as we said earlier even though it hasn't been,1309.78,1315.18
"(1315.18, 1320.94)", adopted we're using it you know it it's it's a very valuable plan in that it it just it utilized,1315.18,1320.94
"(1320.94, 1326.54)", so much input from the community and other sources so um so first of all in terms of,1320.94,1326.54
"(1326.54, 1333.86)", watershed protection uh we are uh increase we are we for years have been doing Grant funding to uh,1326.54,1333.86
"(1333.86, 1338.18)", to fund non-profits to do watershed protection we're looking at increasing that in the future,1333.86,1338.18
"(1338.18, 1343.52)", maybe that's that might even be the most important thing that we're doing to protect the source so,1338.18,1343.52
"(1343.52, 1345.12)", that will continue we're also,1343.52,1345.12
"(1345.12, 1350.64)", protecting our water from contamination we have a bill that's just been introduced to county council,1345.12,1350.64
"(1350.64, 1357.84)", to establish wellhead protection in overlay districts so that there's less risk of well,1350.64,1357.84
"(1357.84, 1367.56)", contamination you know in the area of the well heads we've got a lot going on in water conservation uh we uh we're retrofitting,1357.84,1367.56
"(1367.56, 1375.0)", all of our meters with smart meters smart meters allow the meters to be read remotely which has a,1367.56,1375.0
"(1375.0, 1378.12)", couple of advantages one is the meter reader doesn't have to physically go to the meter but,1375.0,1378.12
"(1378.12, 1384.18)", the other advantage is it provides real-time information on water use and back in my I came,1378.12,1384.18
"(1384.18, 1385.48)"," from California my career back there,",1384.18,1385.48
"(1385.54, 1389.76)"," we did a study in one of the cities I was in, and the smart meters decreased water use 15%.",1385.54,1389.76
"(1390.32, 1396.28)", We did a pilot study because people can get real information on how much water they're using.,1390.32,1396.28
"(1396.9, 1401.74)"," And it also detects leaks. So if like, if the meter's running 24 hours nonstop, you get a note,",1396.9,1401.74
"(1402.06, 1405.34)"," hey, you may have a leak leak so it really helps with water conservation",1402.06,1405.34
"(1410.56, 1416.14)", we're also um have a landscape incentives and guidelines as well as requirements and we're working on a water conservation bill to introduce to the to the county council and our water board,1410.56,1416.14
"(1416.14, 1422.86)", that will it will beef up our water conservation requirements and a big one is our tiered structure,1416.14,1422.86
"(1422.86, 1425.0)", as as the other islands do we have a tiered structure.,1422.86,1425.0
"(1425.72, 1432.28)", And council has just approved a revision to our tier structure where we increase the upper tier a lot.,1425.72,1432.28
"(1433.34, 1440.76)"," And so basically, you know, the the lifeline water rate didn't change much, but the top tier we increased 24 percent.",1433.34,1440.76
"(1441.12, 1445.94)", So that's that's found to be maybe one of the most important things you can do you,1441.12,1445.94
"(1445.94, 1452.0)", know money talks right so to you know to to uh to encourage people to to uh to reduce water use,1445.94,1452.0
"(1452.0, 1458.36)", especially those that are using a lot we also implemented the council will be has approved a,1452.0,1458.36
"(1458.36, 1464.48)", new rate for hotels and resorts that's a higher rate so that they pay more for the water and we,1458.36,1464.48
"(1464.48, 1465.1)", do have some gray water,1464.48,1465.1
"(1465.1, 1468.88)", initiatives going as well we've got one going in a lot of our parks and getting ready to put,1465.1,1468.88
"(1468.88, 1474.16)", in another one so we see those as templates that can help increase gray water use throughout the,1468.88,1474.16
"(1474.16, 1479.56)", county we also have some strategies that deal with climate change we're supporting the collaborative,1474.16,1479.56
"(1479.56, 1485.6)", hydrological efforts studies of impacts of climate change and future well development on groundwater health,1479.56,1485.6
"(1486.24, 1492.96)", and we have an ongoing study with usgs to to assess the effects of scenario-based recharge,1486.24,1492.96
"(1494.48, 1500.08)", change on groundwater in the maui aquifers as demand increases and we're adding stream,1494.48,1500.08
"(1500.08, 1505.28)", gauges and monitoring wells and other tools to assess what's happening with climate change,1500.08,1505.28
"(1511.4, 1517.34)", in terms of source we are for our central system you probably know Maui has 12 separate water system which is so interesting for something from been fairly new here on our central system we're,1511.4,1517.34
"(1517.34, 1522.86)", exploring new basal well development in the southern portion of the why he why he have aquifer,1517.34,1522.86
"(1522.86, 1527.74)", and East East Maui well development as well and we're currently conducting,1522.86,1527.74
"(1527.74, 1531.88)", a feasibility study to be followed by USGS assessment on the interaction between the,1527.74,1531.88
"(1531.88, 1537.16)", groundwater and surface water and potential impacts from pumping the Haiku Aquifer for,1531.88,1537.16
"(1537.16, 1546.54)", upcountry we're exploring new well development in the Makawa Aquifer and the Haiku to meet demand on the upcountry meter priority list.,1537.16,1546.54
"(1547.26, 1553.04)", And we're assessing the new raw water reservoirs to increase reliable supply with consideration,1547.26,1553.04
"(1553.04, 1558.72)", adopted to the in-stream flow standards. We're also considering alternative structures and,1553.04,1558.72
"(1558.72, 1564.5)", processes to expedite the issuing of meters. And that's a whole nother meeting. We'll get,1558.72,1564.5
"(1564.5, 1565.34)", into the meter list,1564.5,1565.34
"(1565.34, 1571.16)", but we're looking at about four or five different strategies to help us to help us address that,1565.34,1571.16
"(1571.16, 1575.6)", meter list in a more efficient way and on the west side over in Lahaina Kapalua area,1571.16,1575.6
"(1576.38, 1584.42)", um we're pursuing new Wells and also working with Maui Land and Pine and Hawaii water services to,1576.38,1584.42
"(1584.42, 1585.76)", integrate look at how we can,1584.42,1585.76
"(1585.76, 1591.22)", integrate our systems better to most efficiently utilize the water in the area and then finally to,1585.76,1591.22
"(1591.22, 1595.78)", address drought and system resiliency we're formalizing the demand response plans and,1591.22,1595.78
"(1595.78, 1601.3)", mutual agreements with the private water purveyors to address water shortages uh they it was a set,1595.78,1601.3
"(1601.3, 1605.34)", earlier when we can declare a water shortage but it's really helpful if,1601.3,1605.34
"(1610.62, 1615.54)", all the other water companies on the island also declare a water shortage so we're looking we see that as really important element we're developing Wells to improve reliability and as it can as a,1610.62,1615.54
"(1615.54, 1620.1)", contingency in areas that are dependent on surface water because walls are you know tend not to,1615.54,1620.1
"(1620.1, 1627.18)", respond as quickly to obviously to rainfall events and And then we're looking to three of our,1620.1,1627.18
"(1627.18, 1633.08)", main water supplies and three of our main areas are the ditch systems. And so we'll continue,1627.18,1633.08
"(1633.08, 1637.92)", relying on those. So we're exploring how we invest in those systems to make sure that they're,1633.08,1637.92
"(1637.92, 1643.5)", adequately maintained. And we're assessing the Wailuku water company system and potentially,1637.92,1643.5
"(1643.5, 1650.86)"," other legacy systems as well. So in summary, the plan serves us as a long-term guy that's the value of it it provides",1643.5,1650.86
"(1650.86, 1656.86)", us a framework in which to to plan our efforts and I believe it's a good foundation that we can update,1650.86,1656.86
"(1656.86, 1662.5)", obviously that's mentioned many times we need to update this regularly and and we'll work with the,1656.86,1662.5
"(1662.5, 1665.28)", community and Commission staff to do that in each sector,1662.5,1665.28
"(1665.28, 1672.66)", and we're also just as a reminder we're tackling the Mokai water use and development plan and we,1665.28,1672.66
"(1672.66, 1676.74)", also have funding for the lanai plan coming up this fiscal year so Mahalo for your attention,1672.66,1676.74

"(1854.8, 1859.92)", have and i'll just say one more thing the need to have what we call a diversified water portfolio,1854.8,1859.92
"(1859.92, 1866.2)", where um you know you need to have multiple sources of water and have a resilient redundant system.,1859.92,1866.2

"(1881.52, 1883.08)", So thank you very much.,1881.52,1883.08
"(1883.08, 1884.86)", Any other questions?,1883.08,1884.86
"(1884.86, 1885.0)"," I have one, John, So thank you very much. Any other questions?",1884.86,1885.0
"(1885.0, 1887.0)", I have one.,1885.0,1887.0
"(1887.0, 1895.0)"," John, this plan, undoubtedly there were challenges with communities.",1887.0,1895.0
"(1895.0, 1905.28)"," So, but it seems like, you know, Councilmember Sinansi did a lot of good work in reaching out, did the rest of the commission how are you proposing to engage",1895.0,1905.28
"(1905.28, 1913.2)", continue to engage the community in this ongoing dialogue on water well sure i mean very actively,1905.28,1913.2
"(1913.2, 1919.68)", and and and uh you know and you know ava ava leads that effort and i think a lot of good work has,1913.2,1919.68
"(1919.68, 1925.04)", been done and and shane has been also great in this for my understanding uh you know I believe there's a,1919.68,1925.04
"(1925.04, 1931.82)", certainly the we need to engage with the community in many ways robustly often and listen to the,1925.04,1931.82
"(1931.82, 1936.5)", community you know we can't always do exactly what the community wants you know sometimes you have to,1931.82,1936.5
"(1936.5, 1941.3)", say well that's not exactly what we can do but but absolutely we need to listen and so you know it's,1936.5,1941.3
"(1941.3, 1949.84)", it's I I go out in the community I've been hundreds and hundreds of community meetings in my career and uh uh you know we had just one uh we had a couple up in recently,1941.3,1949.84
"(1949.84, 1956.32)", up country and it was extremely it was 300 people at the uh community center and you know listening,1949.84,1956.32
"(1956.32, 1960.76)", to their concerns they bring a lot of valuable information which we need to hear and we need,1956.32,1960.76
"(1960.76, 1969.28)", to understand it and we need to uh consider that as we make our decisions so i'm a strong advocate of community participation and we'll continue to do that very actively be,1960.76,1969.28
"(1969.28, 1974.32)", involved with that and then you know ava will help me with how that's done here in hawaii which is,1969.28,1974.32
"(1974.32, 1980.88)", um there's a lot to it here for sure i'm encouraged by your comments thank you very much,1974.32,1980.88
"(1980.88, 1986.32)", any other comments yes please thank you chair hi john thank you for the presentation um,1980.88,1986.32
"(1987.6, 1994.72)", the action list that you just described how and when would that be embedded in the water use plan,1987.6,1994.72
"(1994.72, 2000.88)", that's before us today i think it's in there i mean almost everything i believe everything i said,1994.72,2000.88
"(2001.44, 2006.12)"," has a direct link to the plan so So I didn't quote the sections,",2001.44,2006.12
"(2006.12, 2009.24)", but essentially everything that we're doing,2006.12,2009.24
"(2009.24, 2010.68)", has a link back to the plan.,2009.24,2010.68
"(2011.88, 2014.66)", So is there a quantitative measure,2011.88,2014.66
"(2014.66, 2018.6)", of what your targets are for reuse and reduction,2014.66,2018.6
"(2020.2, 2021.6)", that's part of the plan?,2020.2,2021.6
"(2021.6, 2024.84)", And as it's tied into your general development plan,2021.6,2024.84
"(2024.84, 2025.6)", for Mauui as well,2024.84,2025.6
"(2025.6, 2032.64)", as community development plans because at some point you know these uses will come before us,2025.6,2032.64
"(2032.64, 2040.4)", for us to approve and i guess it'll be helpful if we had some assurances that,2032.64,2040.4
"(2042.16, 2049.12)", that the allocations are based on action plans that you just described,2042.16,2049.12
"(2050.8, 2055.36)", right yeah that is the case I'll probably I think I will defer to Ava for that in terms of the the,2050.8,2055.36
"(2055.36, 2059.56)", quantitative connection to the plan because she's much more familiar with it than I am having worked,2055.36,2059.56
"(2059.56, 2066.24)", on it for for many years so Ava I'll let you uh let you tackle that one if you don't yeah go ahead eva go ahead,2059.56,2066.24
"(2066.24, 2073.6)", mahalo chair um yeah in response to uh the commission's question yes there are quantified,2066.24,2073.6
"(2073.6, 2082.16)", targets for um each strategy in fact that relates to resource use so in terms of recycled water you,2073.6,2082.16
"(2082.16, 2086.64)", have the uh demand and supply projected through year 2035 so in terms of recycled water you have the demand and supply projected through year 2035,2082.16,2086.64
"(2086.64, 2092.72)", so in terms of targeting uh build out of r1 or other recycled water use or whether it's,2086.64,2092.72
"(2092.72, 2098.0)", groundwater development or conservation targets you have those quantified you know in five-year,2092.72,2098.0
"(2098.0, 2104.72)", increments um and then the strategies kind of have the uh short to long-term implementation range,2098.0,2104.72
"(2104.72, 2111.7)"," some of these projects will be you know further scoped out over a very long time, and some of them, like Director mentioned, are already in the works.",2104.72,2111.7
"(2112.66, 2123.2)"," So, yeah, so there are targets in there that we are working through tracking in the implementation matrix so we can report progress to our board and council and to you folks.",2112.66,2123.2
"(2123.96, 2126.8)", And I'll only add to that that i will not hesitate,2123.96,2126.8
"(2126.8, 2136.4)", to exceed the targets um does that also those targets apply to the other purveyors,2126.8,2136.4
"(2136.96, 2148.56)", other than the board of water supply or these action items basically you control all of those hundred percent as we go into the different,2136.96,2148.56
"(2148.56, 2153.46)", regions how are those are going to be managed,2148.56,2153.46
"(2153.46, 2161.9)", and whose auspices that's a really good question um i mean this is one of the,2153.46,2161.9
"(2161.9, 2169.48)", uh challenges right with having the county developing a water use development plan that applies to private water purveyors and other users.,2161.9,2169.48
"(2169.66, 2178.24)"," So in terms of the county agencies investing in recycled water expansion, stormwater use, et cetera, no, the plan does that.",2169.66,2178.24
"(2178.24, 2185.88)"," So it's, you know, that this is also the driver or the guidance for capital improvement program and budget priorities for other agencies",2178.24,2185.88
"(2185.88, 2190.68)", that you know recycle water falls on the department of environmental management Etc for private,2185.88,2190.68
"(2190.68, 2194.48)", purveyors you know there's a lot of incentives in the plans and there are other there are,2190.68,2194.48
"(2194.48, 2200.72)", tools that on the county level can be we can implement strategies through land use controls,2194.48,2200.72
"(2200.72, 2207.28)", or land use approvals so if this is saying a new development um the strategy in the,2200.72,2207.28
"(2207.28, 2213.68)", water strengthen plan is to use x resource and that project comes in for um land use approvals,2207.28,2213.68
"(2213.68, 2217.84)", then we ask the planning commission to to look at that as a guidance and we put those comments,2213.68,2217.84
"(2217.84, 2222.8)", in already in discretionary permit review but yeah we don't obviously we don't have the authority to,2217.84,2222.8
"(2222.8, 2226.24)", impose conservation or allocations,2222.8,2226.24
"(2226.24, 2233.14)"," on the private providers that's no, I think that's a good model to be actively commenting",2226.24,2233.14
"(2233.14, 2235.14)", on land use issues.,2233.14,2235.14
"(2235.14, 2236.14)", Thank you.,2235.14,2236.14
"(2236.14, 2238.14)", You have a comment.,2236.14,2238.14
"(2238.14, 2239.14)", Thanks.,2238.14,2239.14
"(2239.14, 2240.14)", You go.,2239.14,2240.14
"(2240.14, 2249.28)", I think one thing that I'm excited to hear what director shuffleburn said you know I,2240.14,2249.28
"(2249.28, 2255.36)", mean one thing it sounds like molly dws can do is sort of set the pace and set an example with,2249.28,2255.36
"(2255.36, 2268.4)", say smart metering and kind of setting new standards for monitoring usage and conservation um i know it's not in the um plan but it would be exciting to,2255.36,2268.4
"(2268.4, 2274.56)", see you know as you guys get more data and more real-time data to be able to have dashboards or,2268.4,2274.56
"(2274.56, 2280.72)", something um and and it doesn't need to be put in the plan but just to have that in mind is where,2274.56,2280.72
"(2280.72, 2285.12)", things where you folks maybe can take it i think maui is really setting,2280.72,2285.12
"(2285.84, 2291.12)", has opportunity to set new models for the rest of the islands given the whole array,2285.84,2291.12
"(2292.08, 2301.12)", of challenges and opportunities so yeah thanks for articulating that i guess and and helping us kind,2292.08,2301.12
"(2301.12, 2327.04)"," of listen and see where some of those gaps are too, you know, because if you guys set an example, then maybe it allows us as a commission to then point out to the other private purveyors like, hey, look, it's doable. in terms of conservation and kind of innovating so kind of appreciate the work that's been put in",2301.12,2327.04
"(2327.04, 2335.04)", to taking that feedback and and be more responsive great comment thank you any other questions,2327.04,2335.04
"(2336.08, 2340.8)", david did you want to did you want to add anything more um to the discussion because,2336.08,2340.8
"(2343.2, 2348.64)", uh well thank you chair um well i just want to really say we really appreciate that both,2343.2,2348.64
"(2348.64, 2352.96)", the commission staff and the deputy that they you know they're taking the time to scrutinize,2348.64,2352.96
"(2352.96, 2357.84)", the plan and um to further engage with the community members you know after this went,2352.96,2357.84
"(2357.84, 2366.04)"," through council here on our end so um yeah i just want to assure assure you, every voice that came forward was heard and considered",2357.84,2366.04
"(2366.04, 2367.32)", to craft these strategies.,2366.04,2367.32
"(2367.32, 2371.6)", And we think that the proposed conditions,2367.32,2371.6
"(2371.6, 2373.5)"," and the steps in the middle, we can do that,",2371.6,2373.5
"(2373.5, 2376.94)", that can be implemented and that would allow the plan,2373.5,2376.94
"(2376.94, 2377.9)", to go forward.,2376.94,2377.9
"(2377.9, 2382.12)"," Oh, I wanna respond also to Commissioner Hanna's question",2377.9,2382.12
"(2382.12, 2384.38)", or was it Sher's question on what happens,2382.12,2384.38
"(2384.38, 2397.44)"," if the plan is not approved. as director stuff will be you know, a couple of examples of how we already lean on the plan we're using it as a guidance for capital improvement programs and budget priorities.",2384.38,2397.44
"(2398.58, 2406.0)"," Anna Dreber, Planner Item No.1 for 2020. You know, it was adopted by ordinance, but of course the plan has a dual function is to be a guidance document for the Commission as well.",2398.58,2406.0
"(2406.0, 2411.0)"," So. So I think that is, you know, for us, if it was not approved.",2406.0,2411.0
"(2411.0, 2418.0)"," The next update will go through the whole process again with community engagement, going to our board public hearings.",2411.0,2418.0
"(2418.0, 2425.0)"," New comes review and approval. But if it's not approved by the Commission, of course, it's not incorporated into Hawaii water plan.",2418.0,2425.0
"(2425.0, 2429.0)", So you you don't have the tool you know to serve that that purpose.,2425.0,2429.0
"(2429.0, 2436.0)"," I think that would be the real downside you know there's a lot of valuable guidance in there, we believe, for the for the Commission as well.",2429.0,2436.0
"(2436.0, 2444.0)"," So yes, I mean we feel this is already we're gonna continue scoping out projects, strategies, and the plan.",2436.0,2444.0
"(2444.0, 2445.76)"," So they'd be even more opportunity for projects, strategies and the plan. So maybe even more opportunity",2444.0,2445.76
"(2445.76, 2448.74)", for community participation there over the time.,2445.76,2448.74
"(2448.74, 2451.68)", So even revisiting demand and supply,2448.74,2451.68
"(2451.68, 2453.26)", as we're scoping out this project.,2451.68,2453.26
"(2453.26, 2457.28)", So it's a living document and just wanna,2453.26,2457.28
"(2457.28, 2460.22)", all everyone that put so much effort into the process.,2457.28,2460.22
"(2463.82, 2468.44)", So I do have a quick question on the living nature of the document right now it's a PDF,2463.82,2468.44
"(2468.44, 2475.36)", posted to the county website and as it gets updated I noticed some sections had the draft,2468.44,2475.36
"(2475.36, 2482.2)", watermark does that mean the document itself will be versioned or is it going to be I want,2475.36,2482.2
"(2482.2, 2489.0)", to understand how the public is going to access the living document as it gets updated.,2482.2,2489.0
"(2489.0, 2497.0)"," Just the technical details. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So the the Pdf document that now has the links to come from table of content.",2489.0,2497.0
"(2497.0, 2512.0)"," We have the the draft water of you know summary of the implement of the strategies, and you know a tracking sheet.",2497.0,2512.0
"(2512.0, 2515.0)", So we will have that available to the public as well.,2512.0,2515.0
"(2515.0, 2519.0)", So that's something that gets shared with our land use planning departments.,2515.0,2519.0
"(2519.0, 2525.0)"," Our board council is needed, so we can kind of just track and see how that evolves over time.",2519.0,2525.0
"(2525.0, 2532.0)", Then in further updates of the plan i'm pretty sure we're not going to tackle the island as a whole again.,2525.0,2532.0
"(2532.0, 2538.0)", It could be by office sector or by you know watershed or or or whatnot.,2532.0,2538.0
"(2538.0, 2548.64)", So that's way it's a little more manageable I mean it's it's still you know a year-long process but uh so i see that as the updates are done you know it would be focused on on a particular,2538.0,2548.64
"(2548.64, 2554.64)", aquifer sector um and same thing just posted you know for public review as we go through that,2548.64,2554.64
"(2554.64, 2561.28)", process i have a simple suggestion actually i started doing it you can create a navigation pane,2554.64,2561.28
"(2562.0, 2567.62)", in pdf so i'll send you a version because it allows you to navigate from page 1300 back to,2562.0,2567.62
"(2567.62, 2571.38)"," the TOC back to you know, jump around section. So I think that",2567.62,2571.38
"(2571.38, 2575.88)", would ease access and review and feedback and maybe ameliorate,2571.38,2575.88
"(2576.02, 2581.18)", any kind of frustrations. Thank you. Thank you. That was very,2576.02,2581.18
"(2581.18, 2581.78)", helpful.,2581.18,2581.78
"(2582.74, 2587.92)"," Yes, sir. Quick question. What's the status of the Molokai and Lanai water",2582.74,2587.92
"(2587.92, 2597.44)", use development plans Mahalo commissioner we have the consultant townscape halfway through a little,2587.92,2597.44
"(2597.44, 2601.76)", more than halfway through updating the Molokai what are you saying development plan a lot of,2597.44,2601.76
"(2601.76, 2605.76)", the community engagement is completed uh demand projections are done and,2601.76,2605.76
"(2605.76, 2611.2)", we're now betting resource options or presenting resource options to the community so they have,2605.76,2611.2
"(2611.2, 2618.48)", still ways to go uh we put in we have funding approved for this next fiscal year fy24 to um,2611.2,2618.48
"(2619.04, 2623.68)", commission a consultant to help us update the lanai what you stone plan so you know it's a,2619.04,2623.68
"(2623.68, 2627.32)"," multi-year process but thinking you, you know, we'll contract",2623.68,2627.32
"(2627.32, 2630.32)", towards the end of this year to begin that process.,2627.32,2630.32
"(2630.32, 2634.56)"," So what, where do you view the horizon for these plans?",2630.32,2634.56
"(2636.14, 2639.42)", That you'll have something that to present?,2636.14,2639.42
"(2641.7, 2649.0)"," So for Molokai, I'd say earliest March, 2024, to be a draft plan to be presented to our board.",2641.7,2649.0
"(2649.0, 2654.0)", We will brief the commission at the same time.,2649.0,2654.0
"(2654.0, 2666.96)", The board has 180 days to review and provide their comments before we present a bill for an ordinance to our county council um this maui plan took three years through county council so i'm not guaranteeing,2654.0,2666.96
"(2670.48, 2673.76)", you know as soon as that's better and adopted then it'd be presented to,2670.48,2673.76
"(2674.4, 2678.08)", uh through commission and for lanai i would say you know a minimum three years as well,2674.4,2678.08
"(2680.08, 2685.44)", and i will also mention that the monokai plan plan will be it'll be a free theme i think it's next,2680.08,2685.44
"(2685.44, 2690.32)", month or the following month by the consultants to the commission so we're already going to organize,2685.44,2690.32
"(2690.32, 2695.92)", that great that's great super thank you they're just there's going to be a bunch of planning,2690.32,2695.92
"(2696.72, 2700.72)", components of the whole parts of the uh water plant coming to the commission,2696.72,2700.72
"(2701.36, 2706.96)", um we have a couple that the board wants to present on as well um we're trying,2701.36,2706.96
"(2706.96, 2712.8)", not to have more than one per meeting because it's so thick and it's robust and it is a planning,2706.96,2712.8
"(2712.8, 2717.92)", document um so just trying to manage the agendas but they're coming you will you will see a bunch,2712.8,2717.92
"(2717.92, 2727.0)", of these planning documents coming before the spot very good any other questions? This is a rather large document.,2717.92,2727.0
"(2727.0, 2729.0)", Is it nimble enough?,2727.0,2729.0
"(2729.0, 2732.0)", Could you say it's a living document?,2729.0,2732.0
"(2732.0, 2748.48)", But I'm assuming you also utilize the adaptiveble enough that as you get information you can make appropriate,2732.0,2748.48
"(2749.04, 2756.32)", whether it's changes or updates and how does that work out as a practical matter,2749.04,2756.32
"(2757.52, 2762.0)", thank you chair appreciate that and uh i think we're still figuring out you know for for the,2757.52,2762.0
"(2762.0, 2770.96)"," different kind of strategies how we apply them but, I mean, we use it frequently because I mean, this is since it was adopted",2762.0,2770.96

"(5190.72, 5195.84)"," But understanding these individual projects are all part of this larger ecosystem, this",5190.72,5195.84

"(5208.94, 5212.16)"," Okay, I do want you guys to think about it because I mean, I",5208.94,5212.16
"(5212.16, 5216.48)"," want to be equitable. I you know, this project has a very",5212.16,5216.48
"(5216.48, 5221.32)", limited like life and potential impact. But if we keep on,5216.48,5221.32

"(5237.0, 5251.22)"," Very quickly with rain and no rain. Would it be with this applicant be willing to, and I've seen people do this with the Kelly cam, like ecologists put a camera on a plant so that you can just watch it as it flowers.",5237.0,5251.22
"(5252.34, 5258.6)"," You know, would the applicant be willing to maybe work with a local school, because that's Mili Lani, right, right nearby.",5252.34,5258.6
"(5258.6, 5266.32)"," You know, I mean, potentially work for educational and outreach purposes, put a camera above the project site and",5258.6,5266.32
"(5266.32, 5273.28)"," below and just let people kind of watch the stream. It's not, I mean it is a form of data,",5266.32,5273.28
"(5273.28, 5277.44)"," but it's not. Maybe there's a better idea, but I just wanted to put it out there as a way for",5273.28,5277.44
"(5277.44, 5282.0)"," people to engage with their streams because I'm currently working on urban ecology. On Maui,",5277.44,5282.0

"(5290.0, 5294.68)"," we forget that the stream exists and don't care about it, don't weed it, don't cash into",5290.0,5294.68
"(5294.68, 5300.22)"," it and on all kinds. So I think, you know, would people be willing to entertain that",5294.68,5300.22
"(5300.22, 5305.28)", as an idea for the duration of the project.,5300.22,5305.28
"(5307.44, 5312.0)"," I mean, I think that's an excellent. I think for me, it's it's the community needs to feel a sense of ownership",5307.44,5312.0
"(5312.4, 5314.84)", to these resources if they don't see it.,5312.4,5314.84

"(5319.12, 5320.84)", But it does make a difference.,5319.12,5320.84
"(5320.84, 5324.6)", And I think I'm just trying to find different opportunities,5320.84,5324.6
"(5324.6, 5326.8)", and venues and platforms,5324.6,5326.8
"(5326.8, 5332.08)", where one we're not only engaging and educating but we're also getting good data for us to make,5326.8,5332.08
"(5332.08, 5338.32)", better informed decisions because that's that is my you know there's so much unknown i mean,5332.08,5338.32
"(5338.32, 5347.44)", i don't even know what questions to ask but i think when when a project comes before us um i don't know what you know sort of that,5338.32,5347.44
"(5347.44, 5354.16)", shared responsibility so i don't know mr arakaki you i i think this is like i would have came in,5347.44,5354.16
"(5354.16, 5361.12)", here for this what is all this about but i mean i think i hoping you're hearing i obviously we've,5354.16,5361.12
"(5361.12, 5370.82)"," got a lot you know more to think about with the within the department, but I think you kind of hear some of our sentiments I don't know if you have any thoughts or comments.",5361.12,5370.82
"(5371.64, 5372.9)", I just want to add that.,5371.64,5372.9
"(5374.16, 5375.42)", I did mention.,5374.16,5375.42
"(5376.48, 5378.3)", we're following the city's rules.,5376.48,5378.3
"(5379.8, 5389.04)", Part of that rule allows the use of manufactured treatment devices so these are prefabricated units,5379.8,5389.04
"(5390.08, 5398.48)", they also remove nutrients heavy metals other hydrocarbons other contaminants,5390.08,5398.48
"(5400.32, 5405.0)", so that's also being designed with this training system.,5400.32,5405.0
"(5406.36, 5408.56)", And that I think is significant.,5406.36,5408.56
"(5408.56, 5411.86)", One to do a comparison between someone who's using,5408.56,5411.86
"(5411.86, 5416.28)", sort of this less intrusive material,5411.86,5416.28
"(5416.28, 5419.9)", versus others who are doing traditional construction.,5416.28,5419.9
"(5419.9, 5423.46)", Is there a difference on the impacts to our ecosystem?,5419.9,5423.46
"(5423.46, 5424.8)", I don't know.,5423.46,5424.8
"(5424.8, 5427.04)", All I'm suggesting is if there's a,5424.8,5427.04
"(5427.04, 5433.6)", mechanism for us to utilize these applications and these projects as they become before us,5427.04,5433.6
"(5434.24, 5441.92)", to sort of share in this inquiry maybe if i can real quick and maybe a recommendation is we can,5434.24,5441.92
"(5442.56, 5446.0)", maybe tap saint connie as well as Department of Health,5442.56,5446.0
"(5446.0, 5448.2)", and Clean Water Branch to maybe come in,5446.0,5448.2
"(5448.2, 5453.2)", and use their NPS permit as a way to kind of share,5448.2,5453.2

"(5461.74, 5463.9)", where they need more help or more data.,5461.74,5463.9
"(5463.9, 5466.2)", And that's where maybe we could fill the gap,5463.9,5466.2
"(5466.2, 5467.44)", on the policy side.,5466.2,5467.44
"(5467.44, 5469.48)", Maybe that's a recommendation I can pose,5467.44,5469.48
"(5469.48, 5471.96)", and we can bring them to the commission,5469.48,5471.96
"(5471.96, 5474.9)", and see if they're willing to engage at that level.,5471.96,5474.9
"(5474.9, 5476.1)"," I just want to be constructive,",5474.9,5476.1

"(5486.78, 5494.56)"," Well, I appreciate your line of discussion and it gets to really having this body be",5486.78,5494.56
"(5494.56, 5499.68)", more informed as to what those best practices are so that when different consultants or,5494.56,5499.68
"(5499.68, 5505.1)"," different applicants come before us, we can check their proposal against our knowledge.",5499.68,5505.1

"(5512.14, 5519.26)", And I'm wondering if there's some space or way we can have an informational briefing,5512.14,5519.26
"(5519.26, 5525.0)"," from the industry, from the regulatory bodies, as you have suggested, Kalel,",5519.26,5525.0

"(5530.0, 5532.0)", of modern developments these days?,5530.0,5532.0
"(5532.0, 5537.0)", What is the highest standard for what we're creating,5532.0,5537.0
"(5537.0, 5540.0)", that would really allow for the development of lands,5537.0,5540.0
"(5540.0, 5546.9)", in ways that really are beneficial to the environment and not uh,5540.0,5546.9
"(5546.9, 5555.9)", so I think there's a lot of change I mean uh in that industry and I'm they're uh tending to the,5546.9,5555.9
"(5555.9, 5562.44)", impacts that they have and I think it's incumbent upon them to raise the standard to be uh to create,5555.9,5562.44
"(5562.44, 5567.14)", a competitive Edge for themselves as consultants as as developers and so,5562.44,5567.14
"(5567.14, 5572.54)", let's get a briefing and figure out what those where they are yeah and I'll just jump in and,5567.14,5572.54
"(5572.54, 5578.18)", this this is actually really exciting because water quality is is going to be the next the,5572.54,5578.18

"(5583.82, 5590.88)", um with new emerging contaminants and regulations but also just how do we holistically manage that and then as you,5583.82,5590.88
"(5590.88, 5597.04)", mentioned the the real ripple effect it has the monkey connection on all of our resources all of,5590.88,5597.04
"(5597.04, 5602.64)", our programs here at dnr it's real um and finding out how those are connected is going to be really,5597.04,5602.64
"(5602.64, 5605.0)"," really important very true and i guess i'm also just trying gonna be really, really important. Very true.",5602.64,5605.0

"(5656.48, 5662.96)", opportunity to meet these challenges but um oh thank you for entertaining sort of my my little,5656.48,5662.96
"(5662.96, 5666.4)", what i'm i am trying to use every opportunity to,5662.96,5666.4

"(5696.26, 5701.12)", um I don't think Castle and Cook is on the on the video okay okay,5696.26,5701.12
"(5702.5, 5708.24)"," well actually can you just because I didn't pull it out mentally from the submittal,",5702.5,5708.24
"(5708.34, 5713.86)"," just explain, you mentioned you're aligned with best management practices, and you gave more",5708.34,5713.86

"(5740.0, 5746.12)", Let's see if I can pull up a website.,5740.0,5746.12
"(5754.12, 5755.34)", Someone older.,5754.12,5755.34
"(5760.98, 5766.0)", And let's see if I can share my screen.,5760.98,5766.0

"(5828.56, 5831.6)"," So maintenance, removal of trash and debris.",5828.56,5831.6

"(5832.78, 5836.22)", This kind of shows stormwater going through the chamber.,5832.78,5836.22
"(5836.22, 5842.68)", But there's also a trash and debris collection area here.,5836.22,5842.68

"(5852.54, 5853.38)", Yeah.,5852.54,5853.38
"(5855.0, 5856.92)", What's the capacity of that?,5855.0,5856.92
"(5856.92, 5860.28)"," Cause like, you know, in larger flood events",5856.92,5860.28
"(5860.28, 5862.02)", easily exceed that.,5860.28,5862.02
"(5862.02, 5877.28)"," Yeah, the capacity is nowhere near the peak flows that we're designing the off-site drainage system for um it's typically it's very small it's a smaller storm",5862.02,5877.28
"(5880.48, 5885.0)", one inch one inch of rainfall.,5880.48,5885.0
"(5885.0, 5891.0)", But then the swales too should also function as well.,5885.0,5891.0
"(5891.0, 5907.0)", I guess I'm thinking most sediment transport happens in the small events and you're kind of maybe missing some of the most significant.,5891.0,5907.0
"(5907.0, 5923.0)"," Sediments shouldn't be released, whatever gets in here. The city's design criteria is not to treat the peak flow, you know, whether it's the 10 year or larger storms.",5907.0,5923.0
"(5923.0, 5930.0)", Okay.,5923.0,5930.0
"(5933.12, 5934.72)", So it sounds like a conversation with the city. Yeah.,5933.12,5934.72
"(5938.96, 5945.34)"," Russell, can I add to that? Okay, Doreen Young is on. Okay. I'm Doreen Young and I'm with Engineering I was engineering concepts sorry I was having problems with my camera but.",5938.96,5945.34
"(5946.54, 5957.46)"," Doreen Young, wanted to add that the reason why the city chose a one inch rainstorm is that's usually 80% of the frequency of the rainfall that occurs.",5946.54,5957.46
"(5959.06, 5965.52)"," Doreen Young, So that's the reason why the one inch storm is used.",5959.06,5965.52
"(5968.82, 5968.86)", Makes perfect logic. Except 80% of the runoff.,5968.82,5968.86
"(5976.38, 5980.88)"," Probably 80% of the runoff happens 2% of the time, you know, so yeah, I mean, if the coral is getting blanketed, it's happening at the high end. So that sounds like a good",5976.38,5980.88
"(5980.88, 5983.7)", conversation to have across the city.,5980.88,5983.7
"(5983.82, 5986.56)"," Yeah, I think it would be good to talk with",5983.82,5986.56

"(5999.28, 6007.52)", of the commission water resource management so um we will try to bring forward you know this thread of conversation,5999.28,6007.52
"(6008.08, 6013.92)", to the commission it's something that we haven't really focused on but i do think it does have,6008.08,6013.92
"(6013.92, 6027.76)"," impacts on the commission's overall policy setting decision so all right russell when you designed the system, you must have looked at the effluent that you are planning",6013.92,6027.76

"(6038.46, 6044.86)", We did not do any water quality analysis.,6038.46,6044.86
"(6044.86, 6049.28)", Currently it's not a requirement but you're designing a system,6044.86,6049.28
"(6050.64, 6056.16)", to do something correct correct but you don't know what you're gonna that something is that,6050.64,6056.16
"(6056.16, 6068.7)", you gotta handle right that's right so yeah shouldn't you sort of know what you're going to handle even at the one inch events,6056.16,6068.7
"(6070.86, 6080.58)", um I'm assuming there had historical one inch flows or some flows currently correct,6070.86,6080.58
"(6082.2, 6088.32)", all of the testing of these systems that we're specifying are done by the manufacturer,6082.2,6088.32
"(6089.36, 6100.0)", and they follow guidelines of let's say new jersey other jurisdictions so they need to meet,6089.36,6100.0
"(6101.28, 6106.4)", the water quality treatment requirements that were established.,6101.28,6106.4
"(6108.32, 6116.48)", This is all approved by EPA and then passed down to Department of Health and then on to the city,6108.32,6116.48
"(6116.48, 6134.0)", and county as part of their NPDES program. So at this time there's no requirement to look at or measure the pollutants that enter the system and leave the treatment system.,6116.48,6134.0
"(6134.0, 6141.0)"," Okay, no, that's fine. Different conversation, but thank you.",6134.0,6141.0

"(6201.04, 6210.0)", ready good morning chair commissioners ryan im. I'm the program manager for the Groundwater Regulation Branch.,6201.04,6210.0
"(6210.0, 6216.0)", Today I'm going to be presenting to you a briefing item C1.,6210.0,6216.0
"(6216.0, 6227.68)", This will be a briefing on the Commission's data on wells related to the Redhill field tank crisis. So let me share my screen first.,6216.0,6227.68
"(6233.12, 6235.28)", I think you can all see that now. So,6233.12,6235.28
"(6237.84, 6248.0)", I'm going to give you a little bit of an overview of my presentation today should take about maybe 10 minutes or so and this is kind of a little bit,6237.84,6248.0
"(6248.0, 6257.6)", of a spoiler for you so the items i'm gonna go over first of all are uh what are the commission's,6248.0,6257.6
"(6257.6, 6267.04)"," deep monitor well data and what does that tell us about the aquifers in question? Well, the punchline is the aquifers are robust",6257.6,6267.04
"(6267.04, 6269.4)", and they're relatively healthy right now.,6267.04,6269.4
"(6271.02, 6275.78)", Second item I'm gonna be going over is the well pumpage,6271.02,6275.78
"(6275.78, 6279.76)", for the three wells on the Navy system.,6275.78,6279.76
"(6279.76, 6282.52)", And the good news about that is the Navy wells,6279.76,6282.52
"(6282.52, 6285.76)", are being pumped within the allocated amounts that,6282.52,6285.76
"(6285.76, 6295.44)", the Commission has allocated to them and chlorides are stable. The final point I'm going to discuss,6285.76,6295.44
"(6295.44, 6305.28)", is the NAVY monitor wells that have been both drilled so far and what is being proposed.,6295.44,6305.28
"(6310.28, 6313.0)", So my next slide is showing you the aquifer system areas,6310.28,6313.0
"(6317.56, 6322.56)"," on Oahu and our primary, can you see my cursor? Our primary area of concern, generally Waipahu, Waiawa",6317.56,6322.56
"(6322.78, 6330.0)"," because this is the extent of the Navy's water system and their source, the Waiawa shaft is up here.",6322.78,6330.0
"(6330.0, 6338.0)", And primarily Waimalu and Moanalua where the Redhill Hill Tank Farm is located.,6330.0,6338.0
"(6338.0, 6345.0)"," So first of all, let's talk about our deep monitor well data.",6338.0,6345.0
"(6345.0, 6359.0)", I'm going to show you the areas that the three deep monitor wells that i'm gonna sort of talk to you about with respect to what we're seeing in the aquifer.,6345.0,6359.0
"(6359.0, 6367.92)"," First of all, there's aipio Mauko Well. This is, if you know the area, this is located on the road",6359.0,6367.92
"(6367.92, 6372.84)", headed up to the Mililani Mortuary.,6367.92,6372.84
"(6372.84, 6376.56)", This is located within the Waipahu Waiawa Aquifer System area.,6372.84,6376.56
"(6378.44, 6380.52)", We have a Waimalu Deep Monitor Well,6378.44,6380.52
"(6380.52, 6383.94)", that's located within the Waimalu Aquifer System area.,6380.52,6383.94
"(6383.94, 6387.04)", And we also have our Halawa,6383.94,6387.04
"(6387.6, 6393.92)"," Deep Monitor well, which is also actually located within Waimalua. And then this boundary right here",6387.6,6393.92
"(6394.48, 6427.2)"," is the Waimalua Aquifer System. So I want to show you, this is a little bit of a blow up. So these are the Halawa and the Waimalui Deep Monitor Well locations relative to some critical shaft some reference for the location of the Halawa Deep Monitor well,",6394.48,6427.2
"(6427.52, 6430.48)", and the Waimauwa Deep Monitor well and what this is what the,6427.52,6430.48
"(6430.48, 6434.52)", data is telling us about the aquifer relative to the sheds.,6430.48,6434.52
"(6436.82, 6440.4)", And feel free to stop me if you have questions on specific,6436.82,6440.4
"(6440.4, 6444.3)", slides or anything that I'm saying that might be easier than,6440.4,6444.3
"(6444.36, 6455.0)"," than going going back at the end, but it's certainly up to you guys. So let's talk about the aquifer health and those monitor gloves.",6444.36,6455.0
"(6455.0, 6465.0)"," The Commission looks to aquifer health by assessing data which we plot,",6455.0,6465.0
"(6467.16, 6470.6)", showing historic elevations of a couple of things.,6467.16,6470.6
"(6470.6, 6473.76)", The water level that we initially encounter,6470.6,6473.76
"(6473.76, 6475.82)"," when we drop our equipment down the well,",6473.76,6475.82
"(6476.86, 6480.9)", the top at midpoint of the transition zones,6476.86,6480.9
"(6480.9, 6482.38)", from fresh to salt water.,6480.9,6482.38
"(6484.22, 6495.44)"," In the following slides, you're going to see data compiled from field investigations that",6484.22,6495.44
"(6495.44, 6499.48)", our survey branch has done near Red Hill facility.,6495.44,6499.48
"(6499.48, 6503.66)", And these data are presented as a time series.,6499.48,6503.66
"(6503.66, 6506.72)"," So first of all, if you can remember Halawa Deep Monitor Well,",6503.66,6506.72
"(6506.72, 6508.74)", Halawa Deep Monitor Well is located,6506.72,6508.74
"(6508.74, 6510.66)", on the Halawa prison site.,6508.74,6510.66
"(6512.54, 6516.2)"," And this is something that we're not quite sure about,",6512.54,6516.2
"(6516.2, 6518.42)"," but the thickness of the freshwater lands,",6516.2,6518.42
"(6518.42, 6523.42)"," and I'll show you the profile in the next slide,",6518.42,6523.42
"(6523.6, 6526.32)", the thickness of the freshwater lands located,6523.6,6526.32
"(6528.56, 6534.48)", near Palawa Deep Monitor Well is obscured by an upflow of brackish water in the well.,6528.56,6534.48
"(6534.48, 6538.0)", And so I'll explain that a little bit more in the next slide.,6534.48,6538.0
"(6539.76, 6545.16)"," However, the elevations of the top of the transition zone, midpoint of the transition zone,",6539.76,6545.16
"(6545.16, 6548.22)", and the location of seawater indicate,6545.16,6548.22
"(6548.22, 6551.9)", that the conditions are relatively stable,6548.22,6551.9
"(6551.9, 6553.44)", in this region of the aquafib.,6551.9,6553.44
"(6553.44, 6556.6)"," So going to the next slide,",6553.44,6556.6
"(6556.6, 6558.84)"," you'll see that there were some,",6556.6,6558.84
"(6558.84, 6563.62)", I think a little bit of decline prior to 2010.,6558.84,6563.62
"(6563.62, 6567.36)"," We're still trying to figure out what that's attributed to, but as you can see,",6563.62,6567.36
"(6567.36, 6576.08)"," since around 2010, 2011, this is the water table. This is the top of the transition zone.",6567.36,6576.08
"(6577.76, 6588.32)"," This is the midpoint of the transition zone, and this is seawater. And I will note that, again, the brackish upflow",6577.76,6588.32
"(6588.32, 6594.64)", has kind of made us question the thickness of the brackish lens.,6588.32,6594.64
"(6595.54, 6599.04)"," But I will also note that this gets a little bit technical,",6595.54,6599.04
"(6599.26, 6603.48)", but we have a way of estimating the midpoint of the transition zone,6599.26,6603.48
"(6603.48, 6607.2)", is through the Geiben-Hertzberg equation.,6603.48,6607.2
"(6607.92, 6617.88)", The Geiben-Hertzberg equation takes into account the water table above mean sea level and calculates,6607.92,6617.88
"(6617.88, 6626.12)"," the midpoint of the transition zone as about 40 times the initial head. So if it's one foot, it's 40 feet.",6617.88,6626.12
"(6626.12, 6629.52)"," If it's two feet, it's 80 feet, and so on.",6626.12,6629.52
"(6629.52, 6633.48)", So this line here represents what we would calculate,6629.52,6633.48
"(6633.48, 6637.76)", from Geibenherzberg as the midpoint of the transition zone.,6633.48,6637.76
"(6637.76, 6640.16)"," Fortunately, it appears that the midpoint",6637.76,6640.16
"(6640.16, 6642.58)", of the transition zone is still far below,6640.16,6642.58
"(6642.58, 6646.24)", the Geibenherzberg calculated midpoint of the transition zone is still far below the Geibenherzberg calculated midpoint of the,6642.58,6646.24
"(6646.24, 6653.52)", transition zone. So what is this telling us? It's telling us that based on what we know despite the,6646.24,6653.52
"(6654.32, 6663.68)"," up-full war flow of the brackish water, we think that it's both relatively stable and relatively",6654.32,6663.68
"(6663.68, 6665.2)", healthy because this midpoint,6663.68,6665.2
"(6665.2, 6667.56)", is far below what we would calculate,6665.2,6667.56
"(6667.56, 6670.36)", as the midpoint of the transition zone.,6667.56,6670.36
"(6670.36, 6673.6)", So that's data on our Halawa Deep Monitor.,6670.36,6673.6
"(6673.6, 6675.8)"," Next, let's go to Waimalu.",6673.6,6675.8
"(6675.8, 6679.04)"," So Waimalu is located, I suppose,",6675.8,6679.04
"(6679.04, 6685.0)", northwest of the Red Hill fuel tank storage facility.,6679.04,6685.0
"(6687.84, 6690.82)", It does appear that the freshwater lands in Waimalu,6687.84,6690.82
"(6690.82, 6692.14)"," continues to thicken,",6690.82,6692.14
"(6693.12, 6695.96)", indicating that it's probable,6693.12,6695.96
"(6695.96, 6698.14)", that there's a long-term influx of freshwater,6695.96,6698.14
"(6698.14, 6699.32)", from the Hohelau's.,6698.14,6699.32
"(6700.24, 6704.08)"," And the second point is just,",6700.24,6704.08
"(6704.08, 6709.0)"," it's something that we're kind of speculating, so it's by no means definitive.",6704.08,6709.0
"(6709.0, 6726.96)", But the presence of this increasing thickness of freshwater makes us theorize that there may be a hydraulic buffer for the halawa shaft that deflects releases migrating northwest across halawa valley from the,6709.0,6726.96
"(6727.52, 6734.16)", bulk storage facility again and that's a theory so we can't define that yet,6727.52,6734.16
"(6735.04, 6745.0)", but as you'll see at the end of my presentation data is being collected to understand what's happening with respect to the bloom.,6735.04,6745.0
"(6748.0, 6750.52)", And so you see that at the end.,6748.0,6750.52
"(6750.52, 6752.24)", So that's why Malou.,6750.52,6752.24
"(6752.24, 6754.64)"," Yeah, Ryan.",6752.24,6754.64
"(6755.98, 6760.0)"," So theory, that theory, how would that affect contaminants",6755.98,6760.0
"(6760.0, 6763.2)", that would come out of the Redhill facility?,6760.0,6763.2
"(6763.2, 6768.96)"," Yeah, so thank you, Commissioner buck so i i guess our theory",6763.2,6768.96
"(6768.96, 6776.48)", is that if there is a high flux of water coming from the koalas there could there could potentially,6768.96,6776.48
"(6776.48, 6785.0)", be a hydraulic buffer between halava between the bulk storage facility,6776.48,6785.0
"(6785.7, 6789.26)"," and Halawa shaft, but that sort of remains to be seen",6785.7,6789.26
"(6789.26, 6792.36)"," with the data that we are collecting from,",6789.26,6792.36
"(6792.36, 6794.4)"," or not that we're collecting, but the Navy is,",6792.36,6794.4
"(6794.4, 6795.98)", and their consultants are collecting,6794.4,6795.98
"(6795.98, 6799.58)", from the monitor wells.,6795.98,6799.58
"(6799.58, 6801.98)", Does that answer your question?,6799.58,6801.98
"(6801.98, 6808.86)", So the volume of water would deflect any contaminants and stop its westward,6801.98,6808.86
"(6808.86, 6816.52)"," movement? Is that what I'm hearing? Yeah, I mean, in theory, I don't know if that it would deflect",6808.86,6816.52
"(6816.52, 6821.22)"," it, but it would suggest that because there's a large quantity of water coming down from the",6816.52,6821.22
"(6821.22, 6830.8)"," bullets. And again, you know, the location of, let me back up a couple of slides so um so the location of uh location of waimalu deep monitor well it's you know it's all",6821.22,6830.8
"(6830.8, 6836.4)", the way over here the facility is actually right here right so yeah um so you know there's this,6830.8,6836.4
"(6836.4, 6842.4)", you know one of the one of the thoughts that our geologists had was that because so much water is,6836.4,6842.4
"(6842.4, 6852.06)"," coming down and we see a thickening of the lens here, could that suggest that there's, rather than having lateral flow this way, does it help to",6842.4,6852.06
"(6852.06, 6857.7)", deflect the flow away from Palawa Shack with those contaminants coming from the fuel storage tank,6852.06,6857.7
"(6857.7, 6865.84)"," facility? That's just, again, it's just a theory. So I don't want to really put too much weight into that right now until",6857.7,6865.84
"(6865.84, 6873.2)", data is collected from uh from the monitor wells ryan if if theory is important what's the process,6865.84,6873.2
"(6873.2, 6881.12)", for either proving it or negating it so i know that as part of the and and perhaps uh um commissioner,6873.2,6881.12
"(6881.12, 6885.92)", sito can um can address this i know that there were portions of the,6881.12,6885.92
"(6886.56, 6894.56)", um administrative order on consent that required uh determination of groundwater flow patterns and,6886.56,6894.56
"(6894.56, 6909.92)", and groundwater modeling so um i don't know that our theory would necessarily be um how do i say this i think that we would we would understand better if the the thickening of,6894.56,6909.92
"(6909.92, 6927.0)"," the lens in the context of what the models are um estimating does that make sense not to me. Okay, just go ahead.",6909.92,6927.0
"(6927.0, 6929.0)"," Go ahead, finish this.",6927.0,6929.0
"(6929.0, 6938.0)"," Oh, no, I was just gonna say that I don't think that that I mean it could be the data that we're collecting from this deep monitor.",6929.0,6938.0
"(6938.0, 6947.12)"," Well, could certainly be used by whoever's preparing the model in estimating groundwater flow but in and of itself",6938.0,6947.12
"(6947.12, 6955.12)", i don't know that that we that that provides us enough data to really make a uh a defining,6947.12,6955.12
"(6955.12, 6960.24)", statement on groundwater flow patterns because again you'll see the proximity of this well,6955.12,6960.24
"(6960.24, 6965.68)"," to the fuel tank fuel tank facility and you see the location of Palawa Shack, it's far enough away",6960.24,6965.68
"(6965.68, 6972.92)", that it really is just a theory right now that would be validated once the model gets created.,6965.68,6972.92
"(6972.92, 6981.08)"," And if our data can be used as an input parameter to the model, that's a good thing,",6972.92,6981.08
"(6981.28, 6986.32)", right? But I'm not a modelerer i don't understand that component of it so,6981.28,6986.32
"(6986.96, 6994.32)", um again i think that perhaps our theory may be validated by whatever the model tells us,6986.96,6994.32
"(6995.2, 7006.0)"," uh but i'm not sure that we can really make any definitive statement about it i hope that makes sense. Yeah, quick question.",6995.2,7006.0
"(7006.0, 7012.0)"," Ryan, you know, so we, you're groundwater, you focus on sort of what you can measure from a borehole.",7006.0,7012.0

"(7036.64, 7040.96)", sort of multiple streams of data together because we might just be looking at like the pulse and,7036.64,7040.96
"(7040.96, 7051.42)"," blood pressure when we need to be looking at, I don't know, lung capacity, you know, like other multiple metrics of aquifer health. Have we fully squeezed the sea worm",7040.96,7051.42

"(7099.0, 7125.6)"," But you know, regarding seep it runs and stream data, you know i'll let maybe Dr stroke and and and the branch chief Dean maybe comment on that to really assess aquifer health as a you know more holistic manner. think you hit on the head um our groundwater guys are good at what they do right evaluating",7099.0,7125.6
"(7125.6, 7134.88)", water levels chlorides the profile right of our aquifer and oftentimes um the changes in,7125.6,7134.88
"(7134.88, 7141.44)", groundwater take years if not decades to see right over time so it's kind of just monitoring that,7134.88,7141.44
"(7141.44, 7145.6)", it's not a you know rain event when all of a sudden our aquifer increases,7141.44,7145.6
"(7145.6, 7150.96)", um exponentially um but with that said we do know there's interaction and there's additional data,7145.6,7150.96
"(7150.96, 7155.84)", sets and data gaps that we potentially need to fill kind of mirror you know rifting a foot,7150.96,7155.84
"(7155.84, 7161.92)", church and mentioned we the more data we have the better um and more informed decisions will be made,7155.84,7161.92
"(7162.56, 7166.38)", um holistically as it relates to aquifer health.,7162.56,7166.38
"(7166.38, 7171.16)"," So there are studies here, these are gaining streams.",7166.38,7171.16
"(7171.16, 7174.16)", So there is a groundwater surface water connection,7171.16,7174.16

"(7196.74, 7199.7)", So we do look at it holistically.,7196.74,7199.7
"(7199.7, 7205.04)", A lot of it's just taking the components of groundwater research the components of surface waters research,7199.7,7205.04
"(7205.6, 7211.36)", data from department of health and uh and kind of putting that together and then looking at okay,7205.6,7211.36
"(7211.36, 7217.84)", well what is the management recommendations that we want to propose our primary tool in in this,7211.36,7217.84
"(7217.84, 7225.6)", region is water use permit right and the conditions of you know the withdrawal of water and the conditions of the withdrawal of water and the impact that it has on both ground,7217.84,7225.6

"(7242.26, 7244.22)", can we have a conversation about the data,7242.26,7244.22
"(7244.22, 7249.04)", that we're collecting? We hear a lot of DOH we can we have a conversation about the data that we're collecting we hear a lot of doh data we hear a lot about navy data well what is the data that,7244.22,7249.04
"(7249.04, 7254.32)", we're collecting um that's the purpose of today's presentation share that with you get feedback on,7249.04,7254.32
"(7254.32, 7259.92)", if you want us to focus or there's things that you're seeing are missing let us know and we can,7254.32,7259.92
"(7259.92, 7266.16)", look at what resources we have to try to try to fill those gaps so so the short answer is,7259.92,7266.16
"(7266.16, 7272.32)", any streams we don't have we haven't put together the multiple streams of data but according to deep,7266.16,7272.32
"(7272.32, 7278.4)", monitor wells looks pretty good the groundwater aqua for health at this point yeah and he'll keep,7272.32,7278.4
"(7278.4, 7289.22)"," going through the rest of the system i don't want to hold that up. Yeah, that's the general summary. I think you bring that well.",7278.4,7289.22
"(7294.14, 7297.6)"," Okay, so I believe this is where I left off, I think. We were looking at particularly why model would be monitor",7294.14,7297.6
"(7297.6, 7302.1)", well and how that thick lens thickening,7297.6,7302.1
"(7302.1, 7307.04)", is maybe suggesting a hydraulic buffer.,7302.1,7307.04
"(7307.04, 7311.16)"," So as you can see, as a time series,",7307.04,7311.16
"(7311.16, 7316.74)", we have the water table actually rose.,7311.16,7316.74
"(7316.74, 7323.52)", It rose about maybe 18 and 1 half feet from May to April.,7316.74,7323.52
"(7323.52, 7325.0)", From 2005 to 2023.,7323.52,7325.0
"(7326.86, 7331.86)", We do see again a thickening of the transition zone here.,7326.86,7331.86
"(7334.9, 7336.8)"," And this is again, Diven-Hertzberg.",7334.9,7336.8
"(7336.8, 7339.9)"," So this is telling us that where it should be,",7336.8,7339.9
"(7339.9, 7343.92)"," and maybe it's arriving at a steady state condition,",7339.9,7343.92
"(7343.92, 7349.08)"," I don't know, but this is the data that we're collecting from Mobile Model Deep Monitor.",7343.92,7349.08
"(7351.56, 7354.92)", So the last well that we're going to look at,7351.56,7354.92
"(7355.56, 7358.0)", is the Waipio-Mauka Deep Monitor well.,7355.56,7358.0
"(7358.0, 7360.16)"," And again, Shucks, you know what?",7358.0,7360.16
"(7360.16, 7363.84)", I'll give you a little bit better information on this,7360.16,7363.84
"(7363.84, 7368.0)", as we go through the Navy system well.,7363.84,7368.0
"(7368.0, 7389.08)"," But again, this is the Waipio Mauka Deep Monitor Well that's located right off of the road going up towards the summit, towards that Miligani Cemetery. So we see in this well, the freshwater lands continues to slowly bend about, well, about 100 feet.",7368.0,7389.08
"(7389.92, 7391.58)"," I don't know if you can say that's slow,",7389.92,7391.58
"(7391.58, 7395.74)", but it's been 37 years since we've seen that.,7391.58,7395.74
"(7397.58, 7399.98)", The elevation of the midpoint of the transition zone,7397.58,7399.98
"(7399.98, 7401.58)", shows a gentle rise.,7399.98,7401.58
"(7402.66, 7404.86)"," But again, the current elevation is still below",7402.66,7404.86

"(7408.52, 7411.18)", which indicates to us that the current thickness,7408.52,7411.18
"(7411.18, 7412.64)", is greater than expected.,7411.18,7412.64
"(7413.6, 7416.76)"," So going to the next slide, you can see again,",7413.6,7416.76
"(7416.76, 7419.88)"," this is Geiben-Hertzberg, that's the midpoint of,",7416.76,7419.88
"(7419.88, 7422.08)", this is the midpoint of the transition zone.,7419.88,7422.08
"(7423.88, 7426.72)", So this is the top of the transition zone. So this is the top of the transition zone. So we are,7423.88,7426.72
"(7428.0, 7435.2)", quite significantly below the calculated Guybert-Kurtzberg midpoint of the transition zone.,7428.0,7435.2
"(7437.2, 7450.96)"," And again, this well is located kind of close to the Navy's Uyi abashak which they are they've placed a hundred percent reliance on to",7437.2,7450.96
"(7450.96, 7458.56)", supply water for this so that's a good segue into the next portion of my presentation which is,7450.96,7458.56
"(7458.56, 7466.38)"," talking about navy system pumping centers so right ryan excuse. Before you go on to the next chapter,",7458.56,7466.38
"(7466.38, 7467.92)", I'm just curious.,7466.38,7467.92
"(7467.92, 7472.82)", The thickening has occurred since 2005.,7467.92,7472.82
"(7472.82, 7481.02)", Might the Waihohe water decision and or the diminished use,7472.82,7481.02
"(7481.02, 7487.0)", of water for sugar have contributed to less withdrawal and more,7481.02,7487.0
"(7487.36, 7489.24)", uh retainment.,7487.36,7489.24
"(7489.9, 7506.64)"," So um so it appears that way peel Malka has um actually um it that the the water level is rising, but we're also seeing um um a rise of the midpoint of the top of the transition zone and the midpoint",7489.9,7506.64
"(7506.64, 7513.04)", of the transition zone so you know that would suggest some some kind of um i don't know i mean,7506.64,7513.04
"(7513.04, 7520.16)", at this point could that suggest some kind of depletion i'm not really sure um yeah that's a,7513.04,7520.16
"(7520.16, 7525.68)"," great question i mean we we with respect to Waihole,",7520.16,7525.68
"(7525.68, 7530.68)", we see development tunnels are quite still actively in use.,7525.68,7530.68
"(7535.58, 7539.74)", And I believe that the development tunnels,7535.58,7539.74
"(7539.74, 7541.56)", are on the windward side.,7539.74,7541.56
"(7543.08, 7552.16)", They do extend. It appears that they may extend hydrologically possibly into,7543.08,7552.16
"(7552.16, 7558.48)", the Waipahu Waiafa aquifer system so whether the development tunnels are depleting recharge of,7552.16,7558.48
"(7558.48, 7569.0)"," Waipahu Waiafa that's a that's a great question although know, I think that I'm trying to think of the timeline now.",7558.48,7569.0
"(7569.0, 7576.0)"," I'm trying to think of Waipole Ditch with respect to, you know, the pineapple fields on the Kunia side,",7569.0,7576.0
"(7576.0, 7582.0)"," and when things started actually transitioning over from the transition from sugar to pineapple,",7576.0,7582.0
"(7582.0, 7586.72)"," and then pineapple to what's being seen in Kunia as, you know,",7582.0,7586.72
"(7586.72, 7591.7)", what we're seeing is diversified crops and some seed corn. I think seed corn is kind,7586.72,7591.7
"(7591.7, 7600.96)"," of diminishing. I've really got to take a look at the data for what's, you know, for",7591.7,7600.96
"(7600.96, 7612.16)", the Waihole withdrawals. Waihole is interesting interesting right because they what they do is there's a valve at the um at the north portal that i think is north portal that they turn,7600.96,7612.16
"(7612.16, 7619.12)", on and off depending on how much rainfall they get on the leeward side there's also a development,7612.16,7619.12
"(7619.12, 7628.48)"," tunnel while a development tunnel that actually develops water um the leeward side, that's never really",7619.12,7628.48
"(7628.48, 7635.36)"," sort of shut off, right? So it's hard for me to, all that to say that I think it's hard for me to",7628.48,7635.36
"(7635.36, 7648.28)"," attribute any kind of changes in the aquifer, you know, mauka, or even within waipio mauka as being attributed to sugar production,",7635.36,7648.28
"(7648.48, 7652.24)"," or the reduction of sugar production, or the change in agricultural use. So",7648.48,7652.24
"(7652.24, 7655.02)"," I guess the short answer is, I don't know.",7652.24,7655.02
"(7658.12, 7668.4)"," I know I can be wordy, but it takes, sometimes I'm processing my thoughts as i'm speaking i can interject i wanted to um",7658.12,7668.4
"(7668.4, 7675.92)", suggest scott izuka from usgs they released a really interesting groundwater availability,7668.4,7675.92
"(7675.92, 7681.44)", scenarios report in april and so maybe that can be they're coming next time okay you're already on it,7675.92,7681.44
"(7682.48, 7687.28)", sorry we try to get you the cutting edge yeah yeah well wrc hosted him,7682.48,7687.28
"(7687.28, 7693.36)", so the the um recording there might be a previous recording online and then we'll hear next month so,7687.28,7693.36
"(7693.36, 7698.72)", i think that'll help us because it was really helpful to see his maps and and have that dialogue,7693.36,7698.72
"(7703.12, 7706.0)"," shall i continue yep, go ahead.",7703.12,7706.0
"(7706.0, 7713.0)"," Okay, so again, talking about now we're segwaying into the Navy pumping centers.",7706.0,7713.0
"(7713.0, 7720.0)", So I'm going to show you on the next map the 3 shaft sources that the Navy has for the system.,7713.0,7720.0
"(7720.0, 7724.0)", Ayahalawa shaft is the smallest source.,7720.0,7724.0
"(7724.0, 7746.2)", This has an allocation of 0.697 MGD. Redapa Shaft is the most productive shaft,7724.0,7746.2
"(7746.2, 7750.08)", within the Waiapa aquifer system.,7746.2,7750.08
"(7750.08, 7753.78)", And it has an allocation of 14.977 MGD.,7750.08,7753.78
"(7753.78, 7756.04)", And I will note that these are all,7753.78,7756.04
"(7756.04, 7759.22)", are under a public water system.,7756.04,7759.22
"(7759.22, 7763.62)", So here's a map that shows you basically the extent,7759.22,7763.62
"(7763.62, 7768.56)", of the Navy system. You can see how far i mean it extends,7763.62,7768.56
"(7768.56, 7773.76)", all the way out into fort island and then obviously out into the west lock portion airport point,7768.56,7773.76
"(7774.8, 7793.0)"," um again huayaba shaft is the farthest uh sort of uh that's not farthest north, I guess, on the system. And I was mentioning that the our YPO Monca Monanoa is like around here somewhere.",7774.8,7793.0
"(7793.0, 7801.0)"," This is the Navy's Taya Halawa shaft, which this is the small allocation, like 0.497.",7793.0,7801.0
"(7801.0, 7807.8)"," And this is Red Hill shaft, which is located right next to the field tank farm.",7801.0,7807.8
"(7807.8, 7815.96)"," So and this one has the allocation of about four point, I don't know, under five MG.",7807.8,7815.96
"(7815.96, 7820.64)"," So again, here's a better map showing the location of the shafts.",7815.96,7820.64
"(7820.64, 7825.0)"," Here's Guayaba shaft, here's Ayahalaba, here's Renio shaft.",7820.64,7825.0
"(7827.8, 7832.8)", So let's look at the pumpage prior to the fuel release,7827.8,7832.8
"(7833.06, 7836.84)", and the resulting change in pumpage as a response.,7833.06,7836.84
"(7836.84, 7840.18)"," So in November of 2021, oh, this doesn't look good, right?",7836.84,7840.18
"(7840.18, 7843.0)", Like they were pumping 0.272.,7840.18,7843.0
"(7843.0, 7845.52)"," They were within their allocation for Ayah-Halawa shaft. Again,",7843.0,7845.52
"(7845.52, 7852.88)"," that's a small source. Wayaba shaft, they were over pumping very small on a 12-month moving",7845.52,7852.88
"(7852.88, 7857.6)"," average, but they were over pumping it. And Red Hill shaft was over pumping by about a half a",7852.88,7857.6
"(7857.6, 7865.0)", million gallons per day. So this doesn't look good. Combined 12-month moving average pumpage of 20.363 MGD.,7857.6,7865.0
"(7867.36, 7871.44)", So the following three slides are just an indication.,7867.36,7871.44
"(7871.44, 7873.98)"," And this is kind of, it's a little bit,",7871.44,7873.98
"(7875.3, 7877.24)", I don't wanna be misleading about it,7875.3,7877.24
"(7877.24, 7880.7)"," because it's hard to tell by the scale, right?",7877.24,7880.7
"(7880.7, 7881.96)"," If we're looking at the scale of this,",7880.7,7881.96
"(7881.96, 7885.34)"," this is really just 0.8 million gallons per day. So we're seeing, the scale of this, this is really just point eight million gallons per day.",7881.96,7885.34
"(7885.34, 7893.2)", So we're seeing we saw a decrease in time series of the 12 month moving average from about.,7885.34,7893.2
"(7893.2, 7898.54)", So we saw the graphs I'm providing you from 2020 to the present.,7893.2,7898.54
"(7898.54, 7903.04)", And you see a reduction of how they basically took a lot of a shot offline.,7898.54,7903.04
"(7903.04, 7906.54)", I think they were pumping it for some testing purposes or whatever.,7903.04,7906.54
"(7907.96, 7910.92)"," Red Hill Shaft, let's see.",7907.96,7910.92
"(7910.92, 7914.24)"," So I think since, I can't remember the date,",7910.92,7914.24
"(7914.24, 7917.32)", but they started pumping Red Hill Shaft,7914.24,7917.32
"(7917.32, 7922.32)", in order to induce like a plume containment situation.,7917.32,7922.32
"(7923.84, 7926.44)"," Is that right, Commissioner Zico?",7923.84,7926.44
"(7926.44, 7929.96)", And so they exceeded their allocation.,7926.44,7929.96
"(7929.96, 7932.5)"," Of course, the allocation that the commission issued",7929.96,7932.5
"(7932.5, 7935.88)"," was for consumptive purposes,",7932.5,7935.88
"(7935.88, 7938.52)", but they converted Redhill shaft over,7935.88,7938.52
"(7938.52, 7940.44)", to pumping it for plume containment.,7938.52,7940.44
"(7940.44, 7949.0)"," So you'll, again, I don't want this to be sort of well, you can see I mean it's it's it's a it was about above their allocation.",7940.44,7949.0
"(7949.0, 7959.0)"," Maybe they they they peaked by about point 2 Mgb at one point, and then started stepping down their pumpage of radio shaft.",7949.0,7959.0
"(7959.0, 7968.0)"," And then the last graph again I think this is this this one's a little bit confusing, because you'll see my time series goes from 12.5 to 17.",7959.0,7968.0
"(7968.0, 7974.0)"," So if I had it, it went all the way down to 0 I think you'd have a better idea of how much they were over pumping.",7968.0,7974.0
"(7974.0, 7979.0)", While my shop and i'm not making excuses for the navy by any means.,7974.0,7979.0
"(7979.0, 7988.0)"," But why, of a shaft was is the only source that's online to supply their entire water system. So you can see how much in",7979.0,7988.0
"(7988.0, 7995.68)", excess they did pump. We are keeping tabs on both their pumpage and the chlorides of guava shaft,7988.0,7995.68
"(7996.56, 8007.06)", on a more finer scale. So let's talk about the change in pumpage in response to the release.,7996.56,8007.06
"(8008.3, 8019.48)"," Red Hill Shaft stopped in December 2021 and resumed on January 29, 2022 for flume containment, and they've been pumping an average of about 4.2 mgb.",8008.3,8019.48
"(8021.5, 8025.0)", Pumpage ceased at Ayahalava Shaft at the same time.,8021.5,8025.0
"(8025.0, 8037.0)"," Pumps started up again in September of 2022, and I think they just run the pumps periodically, just for a couple of days a month, and they only pump about 100,000 gallons a month.",8025.0,8037.0
"(8037.0, 8046.74)"," And then, I'm sorry, and then, Wayava Shaft has always been, again, that's the one that they exceeded their allocation for.",8037.0,8046.74
"(8048.1, 8057.7)", And we've discovered or they've discovered leaks in the system that can speak to why they were over pumping.,8048.1,8057.7
"(8058.6, 8063.88)"," And at a certain point, they pumped 16.993 million gallons per day.",8058.6,8063.88
"(8063.88, 8067.52)"," But again, they're reducing pumping",8063.88,8067.52
"(8067.52, 8076.72)", guayaba I think partly due to some efficiency measures and also they had fixed there was a,8067.52,8076.72
"(8076.72, 8089.0)"," big leak in the pearl harbor peninsula that they fixed and so you see that their 12 month moving average as of May 2023 is 14.9 mgd, which is below their elevation.",8076.72,8089.0
"(8089.0, 8100.0)"," And again, just leak in the water system just for clarification, because that was we did this presentation prior and there was concern that it was in the actual fuel system.",8089.0,8100.0
"(8100.0, 8105.84)"," No, it's the water system that Ryan's talking about thank you yeah that I should",8100.0,8105.84
"(8105.84, 8111.68)", have been a little clearer about that I think it was it was those kinds of water distribution leaks,8105.84,8111.68
"(8111.68, 8118.32)", that you see in all big water systems right for the water supply and so discovered one and I think,8111.68,8118.32
"(8118.32, 8134.0)"," this is I think maybe that's part of the silver lining in this whole situation is it's caused us to put a lot more scrutiny on the Navy's data with respect to both the pumpage, aquifer health, and particularly salinity.",8118.32,8134.0
"(8134.0, 8138.0)", So this slide shows the current pumpage.,8134.0,8138.0
"(8138.0, 8145.28)"," And then you see that, okay, Ayahalawa Shaft basically offline um why off a shaft they were brought you know they brought their pumpage",8138.0,8145.28
"(8145.28, 8150.24)", down below their allocation uh red hill shaft again below their allocation although this is,8145.28,8150.24
"(8150.24, 8155.68)", for plume containment this is not feeding into the system and you see that the combined uh 12,8150.24,8155.68
"(8155.68, 8168.4)", month moving average is 18.972 from 20.363 as of november of. So can they sustain running the system with one source? Yes. Is that,8155.68,8168.4
"(8168.4, 8175.04)"," a good idea? Probably not because if Yava shaft goes down, they don't have water for this.",8168.4,8175.04
"(8177.36, 8185.52)", The one thing that we wanted to make sure that we looked at was chlorides and because chlorides give us an indication of for health.,8177.36,8185.52
"(8186.88, 8193.92)", And so this is a plot of chloride. So you'll see this scale is pumpage in million gallons per day.,8186.88,8193.92
"(8194.64, 8199.6)", This scale is parts in terms of parts per million. So you see some variability. The orange dots are,8194.64,8199.6
"(8199.6, 8206.8)"," the cards and you see some variability, but it's relatively pretty stable and pretty good at about maybe",8199.6,8206.8
"(8206.8, 8212.26)"," 130, 130 parts per million.",8206.8,8212.26
"(8212.26, 8217.44)"," Wyaba shaft is the one that I think we're really, that we're a lot more interested in",8212.26,8217.44
"(8217.44, 8222.68)"," because as they increase pumpage from Wyaba shaft to support the system, what does that",8217.44,8222.68
"(8222.68, 8223.68)", tell us about the chlorides?,8222.68,8223.68
"(8223.68, 8232.96)"," Well, the chlorides, I mean, this is, it's relatively fresh water, right? Like between 35 and maybe a high of 44 parts per",8223.68,8232.96
"(8232.96, 8238.96)"," million. So we see some variability with respect to pumpage, but not too much.",8232.96,8238.96
"(8242.24, 8248.0)", That takes me through the Navy's water sources.,8242.24,8248.0
"(8248.0, 8251.0)", Did you guys have any questions on that section before you Ryan?,8248.0,8251.0
"(8251.0, 8258.0)"," Aurora has a question. So so while the pumping is declining, but we're heading into summer.",8251.0,8258.0
"(8258.0, 8265.84)", And do you have any in general that's you know high water demand time.,8258.0,8265.84
"(8265.84, 8270.24)", The implication there is that it's probably not going to continue going down over the,8265.84,8270.24
"(8270.24, 8281.06)", summer and they will likely be exceeding that specific allocation for that.,8270.24,8281.06
"(8281.06, 8284.24)", What measures or have there been any dialogues around that?,8281.06,8284.24
"(8284.24, 8285.0)", I can start. What measures or have there been any dialogues around that?,8284.24,8285.0
"(8285.0, 8287.0)"," I mean, I can start.",8285.0,8287.0
"(8287.0, 8290.0)"," Ryan, real quick, the graph here shows summer month usage.",8287.0,8290.0
"(8290.0, 8295.0)"," So if you look at it on the 12th map, they still fall within their allocation.",8290.0,8295.0
"(8295.0, 8311.06)"," So in the bottom frames, right, you know, basically July through August or that period. Those are summer months where you would see higher use.",8295.0,8311.06
"(8311.06, 8318.56)"," So I mean in general we are, what's been great is they've been recording daily, which we",8311.06,8318.56
"(8318.56, 8321.56)", we don't ask of anybody else in the state.,8318.56,8321.56
"(8321.56, 8333.44)", So the Navy has been really really really good at getting us this data that's the only reason why we're able to track it at this scale yeah um over time and then we it is on a,8321.56,8333.44
"(8333.44, 8338.4)", 12th map right with the idea that during summer periods there might be increased pumping to meet,8333.44,8338.4
"(8338.4, 8343.76)", demands and needs but we also ramp up our conservation efforts working with our planning,8338.4,8343.76
"(8343.76, 8345.46)", office and our conservation work.,8343.76,8345.46
"(8345.46, 8355.96)"," So those are some of the strategies that we're working with the Navy, even anybody from the state on is conservation strategies and job preparedness.",8345.46,8355.96
"(8355.96, 8359.56)"," Right. Yeah, because it's not looking the other way.",8355.96,8359.56
"(8359.56, 8366.08)", You're not looking great. It is going to be a prolonged drought per per models right and predictions,8359.56,8366.08
"(8366.08, 8371.76)", so i'm ryan sorry sorry to jump in but go ahead no no that's that's no that's a that's a that's,8366.08,8371.76
"(8371.76, 8389.52)", a great um great thing to add so we also as kalio mentioned we are looking at um both pumpage and chloride data on a finer scale. And normally what we would require of any,8371.76,8389.52
"(8391.28, 8398.08)"," well owner, shaft owner, whatever, is monthly water use and monthly chloride data to be",8391.28,8398.08
"(8398.08, 8405.68)"," submitted. Because of the concern that you brought up, not just for the summer months, but just in general",8398.08,8405.68
"(8405.68, 8414.56)"," as they increase the pumpage, we were looking at daily pumpage and weekly chloride data to be",8405.68,8414.56
"(8414.56, 8429.48)"," submitted so that we can kind of start to get a handle. Are we seeing chloride starting to increase as they're pumping fire. Again, if the past two years of beta is any",8414.56,8429.48
"(8429.48, 8435.54)"," indication, I don't think we're going to see chloride increases as the approach to summer",8429.48,8435.54
"(8435.54, 8441.3)", months. But we'll continue to keep a handle on the data and present anything to you if we see,8435.54,8441.3
"(8441.3, 8446.08)"," that anything is, you know, if there's any adverse impacts on on the aquifer",8441.3,8446.08
"(8448.8, 8457.36)", thanks okay thanks so i'll move on to the next the final section um i wanted to give you guys a um,8448.8,8457.36
"(8458.24, 8506.16)"," uh a briefing on the navy monitor world permit so it's it's uh this is this is an interesting and i EAB – James Cousins drill wells to produce water. We also permit deep monitor wells and permanent deep monitor wells. But a lot of environmental wells that are being done to assess aquifer water quality are done through, you know, via the underground storage tank program at DOH or other environmental programs. So typically,",8458.24,8506.16
"(8506.16, 8513.7)"," we hadn't been permitting these types of environmental monitor wells. Well,",8506.16,8513.7
"(8514.0, 8523.18)"," back in around, I think, 2015 and maybe prior to that, we started permitting the monitor wells",8514.0,8523.18
"(8523.18, 8527.38)", for the Navy. And I think it's a good thing for the commission,8523.18,8527.38
"(8527.38, 8529.88)"," to be involved because as we know,",8527.38,8529.88
"(8529.88, 8533.92)", there's contamination in the area for the Navy,8529.88,8533.92
"(8533.92, 8536.9)", to be constructing the wells in accordance,8533.92,8536.9
"(8536.9, 8540.32)", with our well standards will help us to ensure,8536.9,8540.32
"(8540.32, 8544.72)", that if there's a contamination in the vatals,8540.32,8544.72
"(8544.72, 8547.18)"," or the unsaturated zone above the aquifer,",8544.72,8547.18
"(8547.76, 8555.14)", adhering to our well standards will help prevent contaminant from entering the aquifer from above.,8547.76,8555.14
"(8555.28, 8559.6)"," Not to say that DOH wouldn't be able to do that, but I think our well standards are",8555.28,8559.6
"(8559.6, 8574.0)", are sufficiently designed to protect both that from happening and also from maybe perch water from entering an ungrounded annular space and entering the basal.,8559.6,8574.0
"(8574.0, 8579.0)", So so all that to say that we have been permitting maybe monitor wells.,8574.0,8579.0
"(8579.0, 8587.04)", There are 23 existing navy monitor wells right now in all of these various locations.,8579.0,8587.04
"(8589.36, 8596.32)", There are eight new proposed Navy monitor wells that we have applications in for that are under review.,8589.36,8596.32
"(8597.82, 8606.16)", This shows the location of the Navy monitor wells with respect to the fuel tank farm so this is the fuel tank farm right here,8597.82,8606.16
"(8608.96, 8615.2)", and then water quality data from the monitor well so um we we don't have the expertise within,8608.96,8615.2
"(8615.2, 8627.84)"," groundwater to analyze water quality data but um thank you to commissioner sito for sending me this yesterday. Here are some websites that anybody can go to,",8615.2,8627.84
"(8627.84, 8633.68)"," commissioners, general public can go to to get water quality data from the monitor well. So",8627.84,8633.68
"(8633.68, 8642.0)"," there's the DOH's Red Hill information website. There's the EPA's groundwater results application,",8633.68,8642.0
"(8642.0, 8645.28)", which was just released I think last month or two months ago,8642.0,8645.28
"(8646.08, 8650.64)", and then there's the navy's joint base pearl harbor red hill environmental website,8646.08,8650.64
"(8652.8, 8660.88)", and that's uh basically all i hope oh yeah let's start the recording again just,8652.8,8660.88
"(8660.88, 8666.4)", yeah you can just press start recording it's connecting like it's not sensing something,8660.88,8666.4
"(8677.28, 8680.96)", okay there we go so that concludes my presentation i'm happy to answer,8677.28,8680.96
"(8680.96, 8686.8)", any questions that you guys have or i think i see commissioner c plus one so i'll,8680.96,8686.8
"(8686.8, 8694.72)", deflect some questions to her too but okay thank you so mike yeah uh ryan thanks a lot um i know,8686.8,8694.72
"(8694.72, 8700.0)", the monitoring wells are critical especially the ones in in the west they get a much better idea,8694.72,8700.0
"(8700.0, 8705.8)", of what's in the aquifer and the plume flow. I know we've got some issues with liability,8700.0,8705.8
"(8705.8, 8709.2)"," and trying to put the appropriate monitoring wells in, but let's say",8705.8,8709.2
"(8709.2, 8713.72)"," we put them in there and again, the the commission's kuleana",8709.2,8713.72

"(8727.28, 8735.04)", determinations of kind of the plume and i know theoretical we we don't know but this is an issue,8727.28,8735.04
"(8735.04, 8741.6)", that is going to be with the commission for quite a while uh do you do you have any any projections,8735.04,8741.6
"(8741.6, 8748.32)", of time frames once the monitoring wells are in for us to begin to draw some kind of,8741.6,8748.32
"(8748.32, 8757.16)"," rational observations. Yeah. And I don't want to misspeak, and Joanna is certainly here to",8748.32,8757.16
"(8757.16, 8763.28)"," correct me if I say anything wrong or even expand on what I might say. But I know that initially,",8757.16,8763.28
"(8763.78, 8767.48)"," was it at a FTAC or field tank advisory committee meeting, say, but I know that initially, was it at a FTAC, a field tank advisory committee meeting,",8763.78,8767.48
"(8767.48, 8771.82)"," Joanna, that I think that either EPA or DOH presented",8767.48,8771.82

"(8784.06, 8785.28)", with respect to how,8784.06,8785.28
"(8785.92, 8792.08)", um how plume containment was maybe and and solid um commissioner seat will sort of expand on that,8785.92,8792.08
"(8792.08, 8797.36)", if you can but just for a quick item most of monitor wells are just around the the red hill,8792.08,8797.36
"(8797.36, 8806.0)"," facility we really have not collected data the wells aren't even in yet. So yeah, thank you.",8797.36,8806.0
"(8806.0, 8811.0)", So I will say that I think that there are like like the majority.,8806.0,8811.0
"(8811.0, 8815.0)", I I'd say just about all of the wells are navy wells.,8811.0,8815.0
"(8815.0, 8826.84)"," I know that the Board of Water Supply has, I believe, one monitor well in, and I believe they're applying or are looking to apply for one or two more.",8815.0,8826.84
"(8829.14, 8831.26)"," So I think that the, you know, I kind of see where you're going with this,",8829.14,8831.26
"(8831.26, 8833.12)"," because I know we had talked about this before,",8831.26,8833.12
"(8833.12, 8836.38)", but I'm trying to establish sentinel wells,8833.12,8836.38
"(8836.38, 8840.4)", between the field tank facility and Palawa shaft.,8836.38,8840.4
"(8842.84, 8846.24)", But I don't have a timeline for that.,8842.84,8846.24
"(8846.24, 8849.4)", I think that's going to be a Board of Water Supply question.,8846.24,8849.4
"(8849.4, 8854.98)"," But with an assumption basically where we're talking years, having to put the wells",8849.4,8854.98

"(8860.28, 8865.36)", of timeframes until there's a comfort level that border water supply could open up,8860.28,8865.36
"(8865.36, 8871.92)", the shaft again that's really more like years rather than months uh that you know that's kind,8865.36,8871.92
"(8871.92, 8887.38)", of hard to say i mean the the we um staff has been um sort of staff has been addressing the deep uh the monitor well applications as fast as we can in,8871.92,8887.38
"(8887.38, 8895.48)", order to aid in the um in in assessing um what's happening um and you know they've been coming in,8887.38,8895.48
"(8895.48, 8905.0)", for maybe I want to say maybe 15 wells a year or so um and they've been getting them online relatively quickly.,8895.48,8905.0
"(8906.2, 8908.48)", Maybe within about a year.,8906.2,8908.48
"(8908.48, 8912.72)"," Again, I can't speak on behalf of the Navy,",8908.48,8912.72
"(8912.72, 8917.72)", but they've expanded out their drilling sort of roster,8912.72,8917.72
"(8918.94, 8921.92)"," into maybe three or four drillers at this point,",8918.94,8921.92

"(8923.82, 8930.24)", And I think they're just trying to accelerate drilling monitor wells all over the place so it's hard for me to say but,8923.82,8930.24
"(8931.36, 8938.48)", based on the plan it would appear that maybe within a year or two as far as what has been,8931.36,8938.48
"(8938.48, 8947.04)", planned so far i think all of the wells should be in place and online i i that's my best estimate maybe real quick uh,8938.48,8947.04
"(8947.04, 8952.8)", we did make a request because they are collecting data now in whatever wells have been completed,8947.04,8952.8
"(8953.36, 8960.32)", um to the navy in their next quarterly update which is next month unfortunately um to provide,8953.36,8960.32
"(8960.32, 8976.38)"," kind of like if possible a summary of what they're seeing. You know, we have some wells completed, what is the data showing us now?

"(9006.8, 9015.2)", have a chat opportunity to um sort of i know synthesizes right word but um take in like epa,9006.8,9015.2

"(9043.96, 9045.5)"," Yeah, let me think about this.",9043.96,9045.5
"(9045.5, 9056.12)", So I think that at a certain point we did a collaborative effort with USGS.,9045.5,9056.12
"(9056.12, 9057.24)", I wish Patrick were here.,9056.12,9057.24
"(9057.24, 9066.96)"," Patrick is our geologist and Bob, I wish they were here talking about how they calibrated um the the elevation",9057.24,9066.96
"(9066.96, 9073.68)", surveys of all of the wells in the area um but in terms of sinking data i mean um,9066.96,9073.68
"(9075.28, 9081.2)", i think that the websites that i had mentioned have results of all of the monitor wells in the,9075.28,9081.2
"(9081.2, 9106.48)"," area i'm not sure that they have uh commissioner cito i don't think they have water water supply James Heiting. And then, if you're looking at the data, you know, the data that's being collected, you know, the data that's being collected by the state, you know, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, the state, you know, a lot of we're we trust in our lane, right?",9081.2,9106.48
"(9106.48, 9112.92)", So we're really focusing on a lot of times the aquifer health from a quantity and chloride,9106.48,9112.92
"(9112.92, 9118.92)"," perspective, which is kind of the sweet spot we fit in, in relation to the Department of",9112.92,9118.92
"(9118.92, 9125.0)", Health EPA was is managing the water quality data sets from these well fields.,9118.92,9125.0
"(9125.1, 9126.72)", Putting them together is definitely something,9125.1,9126.72
"(9126.72, 9130.54)"," that we need to try to do more of and be better at,",9126.72,9130.54
"(9130.54, 9134.4)", but a lot of the focus has been quality metrics,9130.54,9134.4
"(9134.4, 9135.4)", that have been presented.,9134.4,9135.4
"(9135.4, 9139.56)", So we can talk about it and see if there's a way for us,9135.4,9139.56
"(9139.56, 9143.94)", to use some of maybe the existing data sharing sites,9139.56,9143.94
"(9143.94, 9147.2)", that DOH or EPA or the Navy has set up and then plug in,9143.94,9147.2
"(9147.2, 9155.52)", some of our you know quantitative data into that okay and maybe that's a that's a that's a task,9147.2,9155.52
"(9155.52, 9162.88)", for UH yeah I was going to suggest I mean you know USGS is very well you know they have a really,9155.52,9162.88
"(9162.88, 9189.36)", strong group of geologists hydrologists and then then we reach as well so I think kind of helping different organizations find their goal in the network questions are where the data is and once the data is available they you just point them and that's okay people get very excited when there's,9162.88,9189.36
"(9189.36, 9197.2)", data yeah okay so i'll pass that word back yes thank you ryan any does any board members,9189.36,9197.2
"(9197.2, 9210.56)", commission have any questions for ryan first off right sorry so this is going back to the chlorides being stable at Red Hill shaft and I was wondering,9197.2,9210.56
"(9210.56, 9216.44)"," because Halava shut off, you know, I mean and Halava used to be a big draw is do you",9210.56,9216.44
"(9216.44, 9224.18)", think that plays into the chloride story there or it's just the aquifer can have and you,9216.44,9224.18
"(9224.18, 9226.8)", know. You know that that's a that that is a good question,9224.18,9226.8
"(9226.8, 9235.92)", um i i would have to look at the data for um the water use reported data from red hill shaft and,9226.8,9235.92
"(9235.92, 9245.0)", compare that to uh you know prior to um halava and then um and then post shutdown of Halawa shaft.,9235.92,9245.0
"(9247.16, 9252.16)"," Again, if our theory or if our geologist theory holds true",9247.16,9252.16
"(9252.44, 9256.54)", that large influx of water from the Po'olaus,9252.44,9256.54
"(9258.88, 9261.42)", would maybe could possibly suggest,9258.88,9261.42
"(9261.42, 9263.52)", that the shutdown of Halawa shaft,9261.42,9263.52
"(9263.52, 9266.64)", wouldn't impact Red Hill shaft in a significant way,9263.52,9266.64
"(9272.32, 9278.24)", any other questions or comments do have it jonathan you've been with us the whole meeting,9272.32,9278.24
"(9278.24, 9288.28)", did you want to were you here to participate in a particular item uh not at this time Mahalo other than I was going,9278.24,9288.28
"(9288.28, 9294.7)", to when it comes to it thank Commissioner Buck for his years okay thank you very much I thought so,9288.28,9294.7
"(9294.7, 9305.7)"," okay anybody else so so my takeaway is generally good news nothing disturbing in disturbing in the data you presented, Ryan?",9294.7,9305.7
"(9306.9, 9309.16)"," Well, not from a water quality standpoint, right?",9306.9,9309.16
"(9309.16, 9313.2)"," Because again, we can't really comment on the perspective",9309.16,9313.2
"(9313.2, 9318.2)", of the presence of contaminants in the aquifer.,9313.2,9318.2
"(9318.92, 9322.06)"," As far as aquifer health and depletion,",9318.92,9322.06
"(9322.06, 9324.58)"," that's really where, again, as Kaleo mentioned,",9322.06,9324.58
"(9324.58, 9325.62)"," that's our sweet spot, right?",9324.58,9325.62
"(9325.74, 9333.12)", So based on our increased monitoring of what's happening with respect to Yaba shaft and looking,9325.74,9333.12
"(9333.12, 9342.68)"," at our deep monitor well data, we are relatively confident that any changes in system pumpage",9333.12,9342.68
"(9342.68, 9346.56)", isn't affecting the aquifers in a negative way,9342.68,9346.56
"(9348.16, 9354.48)", okay thank you and second to kaleo uh the last last month or the month before the navy,9348.16,9354.48
"(9355.36, 9360.48)", made a presentation which really created an opportunity to kind of create a dashboard of,9355.36,9360.48
"(9360.48, 9368.16)", various uh important uh task completions or objectives and milestones that we could track?,9360.48,9368.16
"(9369.48, 9374.82)"," Have we kind of done anything with that? Will we be seeing that on some routine basis,",9369.48,9374.82
"(9374.82, 9381.0)", quarterly perhaps? I'm hoping to try to figure out whether it's some kind of informational,9374.82,9381.0
"(9381.0, 9387.2)", briefing submittal that we have that we can kind of evaluate what we're seeing,9381.0,9387.2
"(9387.2, 9392.64)", related to what they've presented um or just have the navy present on those three things every,9387.2,9392.64
"(9392.64, 9397.84)", quarter so they've agreed i i've consistently reached out and they agreed to be back in july,9392.64,9397.84
"(9397.84, 9403.36)", to update us on those kind of three focal points of the work that they're doing um i'm hopeful,9397.84,9403.36
"(9403.36, 9406.48)", that until the fuel is removed or the,9403.36,9406.48
"(9406.48, 9411.68)"," facility is closed that they're committed, at least we've gotten commitments from leadership",9406.48,9411.68
"(9411.68, 9417.36)"," right now, that they'll be here. So it is those three threads and those focuses are where we want",9411.68,9417.36
"(9417.36, 9423.12)", to have them provide those updates. But I like the idea of kind of keeping the destination targets,9417.36,9423.12
"(9423.68, 9426.6)", solid and then measuring milestone and progress.,9423.68,9426.6
"(9426.66, 9428.94)"," Yeah, I think it's milestones along the way.",9426.66,9428.94
"(9429.16, 9435.94)"," I think one of the, in my opinion, kind of seeing the big picture of things, the biggest issue is the remediation.",9429.16,9435.94
"(9436.26, 9465.6)"," We haven't gotten there yet, right. The focus right now has been on defueling safely the facility. But you know, I think we've been really consistent at the fuel tank advisory commission committee meetings and others that are subject matter expert meetings that've done the feeling but we need to have those",9436.26,9465.6
"(9465.6, 9472.32)", conversations now and set those goals um we can change as we get more data but we really need to,9465.6,9472.32
"(9473.12, 9478.96)", um yeah know where it's where we're going hi ryan,9473.12,9478.96
"(9481.12, 9490.12)", has the navy formed and stood up an organization to meet your expectations moving forward to,9481.12,9490.12
"(9490.12, 9492.16)", provide you timely data?,9490.12,9492.16
"(9492.16, 9498.62)", And how does that organization look as to what they've had historically there?,9492.16,9498.62
"(9498.62, 9519.62)"," I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by what we're looking at. From staff's perspective, we are primarily looking at getting like a finer to reporting of their water use, which that came from NAVFAC directly.",9498.62,9519.62
"(9520.22, 9533.0)"," So in that sense, no, as Khalil mentioned, we are commission is part of the both the fuel tank advisory committee, as well as various subject matter.",9520.22,9533.0
"(9533.0, 9540.0)", Expert groups. maybe the the most significant being the remediation round table.,9533.0,9540.0
"(9540.0, 9549.0)"," So as far as particular commission objectives, yeah, there's there's really there's really nothing that we look at in terms of larger group.",9540.0,9549.0
"(9549.0, 9560.0)"," Although, you know, informally we do consult with several geologists throughout the state about geologic issues as they pertain to monitor wells.",9549.0,9560.0
"(9560.0, 9564.0)"," Otherwise, commission staff is advisory to the field tank.",9560.0,9564.0
"(9564.0, 9565.68)"," Well, we're part of the field tank",9564.0,9565.68
"(9565.68, 9570.8)", advisory committee as well as subject matter experts oh right is there an opportunity one of,9565.68,9570.8
"(9570.8, 9589.8)", the to me issues is that your groundwater staff is sort of limited could we avail the Navy's conscience and hopefully some of their accountability to help improve getting,9570.8,9589.8
"(9589.8, 9596.88)"," groundwater data to what would normally be your function in doing it, but take advantage",9589.8,9596.88
"(9596.88, 9603.56)", of that if they're putting in 35 sentinel wells around the area.,9596.88,9603.56
"(9603.56, 9606.42)"," Can we task them No, that's passing to do",9603.56,9606.42

"(9609.12, 9636.48)"," James Heiting. That's a great question, and actually a timely for me to let you know, my thing has always been, I would prefer for us to be collecting the data rather than the Navy to be collecting the data because, you know, validation data validation is an issue and for us to do that stuff in house.",9609.12,9636.48
"(9636.48, 9646.64)", It gives me much more confidence that we can make better assessments on offer help. So we did get four new positions I'm in the process of uh trying to figure out how to,9636.48,9646.64
"(9646.64, 9651.44)", fill those positions and how to write the position description so um but whether the navy can,9646.64,9651.44
"(9651.44, 9658.08)", contribute to that yeah i would love that you know well i think they're obligated to do something,9651.44,9658.08
"(9658.08, 9666.96)"," now if i can add to that so you know the government well the state of haw well, the state of Hawaii, the state and the counties created this unified statement.",9658.08,9666.96
"(9667.36, 9688.62)"," Part of the goal of this unified statement or this coalition is to bring all of the different agencies together, including the county, to hold the Navy accountable for more than just remediation. I mean, so we sit on that and my concern is",9667.36,9688.62
"(9688.62, 9693.62)"," it's not just water quality and water quantity,",9688.62,9693.62
"(9694.24, 9696.2)", but the health of our ecosystem.,9694.24,9696.2
"(9696.2, 9699.28)"," Like what impact does this have to the near-shore waters,",9696.2,9699.28
"(9699.28, 9701.3)"," up on the streams, up Malka?",9699.28,9701.3
"(9701.3, 9704.54)", So we are trying to leverage the Navy,9701.3,9704.54
"(9704.54, 9707.92)", through this opportunity to require them to,9704.54,9707.92
"(9707.92, 9714.76)"," do more data, you know, have them responsible because there's a whole question as to, as you",9707.92,9714.76
"(9714.76, 9720.94)"," say, right, the validation. I mean, we're only getting information from what the Navy's providing",9714.76,9720.94

"(9739.22, 9742.52)", for us to hold the Navy accountable.,9739.22,9742.52
"(9742.52, 9748.08)"," Cause if our goal is not just, just you know clean water with infiltration",9742.52,9748.08
"(9748.08, 9753.68)", i mean far from that i mean we want to be able to have clean water for future generations that,9748.08,9753.68
"(9753.68, 9759.04)", doesn't have to all have to go through filtration we also want to have clean water so our resources,9753.68,9759.04
"(9759.04, 9771.8)"," are taken care of so the part of the mission of this unified statement, this coalition, is to draft federal legislation and to get money to finance this.",9759.04,9771.8
"(9771.88, 9787.28)", And it shouldn't be funded by the state of Hawaii. It should be financed by the United States. speaking going through that process to try to be very comprehensive and inclusive and bring the,9771.88,9787.28
"(9787.28, 9794.64)", right people to the table to begin to identify what's you know what what's our long-term goal,9787.28,9794.64
"(9794.64, 9801.6)", and then working backwards how do we how do we get sufficient information data resources to get us to,9794.64,9801.6
"(9801.6, 9805.92)", that point so we are being very cognizant of that for sure yeah,9801.6,9805.92
"(9807.2, 9813.68)", any other questions or comments to staff ryan or anybody else on this update and kaleo's right i,9807.2,9813.68
"(9813.68, 9818.88)", think you did confirm with the navy they'll be here so yeah so they are keeping to their,9813.68,9818.88
"(9818.88, 9827.28)"," commitment to do quarterly updates to us following up on that first meeting. So with that, this was just informational briefing, right?",9818.88,9827.28
"(9827.28, 9830.78)", So I'm having no other comments or questions.,9827.28,9830.78

"(9842.78, 9844.8)"," Yeah, I wanna be cautiously optimistic",9842.78,9844.8
"(9844.8, 9845.2)", about the,9844.8,9845.2
"(9845.76, 9851.36)", the data that you gave us and the health um but you know preliminary we still got a lot more,9845.76,9851.36
"(9851.36, 9859.6)", so with that being said this item is closed and one more item yes item d1 is just uh,9851.36,9859.6
"(9859.6, 9866.64)", chance our farewell address from our commissioner just super and uh and uh you know formal you guys,9859.6,9866.64
"(9866.64, 9871.68)", got some formal written comments over there for the record but uh i do have some other comments,9866.64,9871.68
"(9871.68, 9878.96)", last time you'll hear me talk uh at least on this side of the table um i know many of you here when,9871.68,9878.96
"(9878.96, 9887.0)", commissioner beamer gave his uh goodbye comments i think he identified 41 different streams,9878.96,9887.0
"(9887.0, 9890.78)"," that we set in stream flow standards during his tenure,",9887.0,9890.78
"(9890.78, 9893.34)", which somewhat overlap.,9890.78,9893.34
"(9893.34, 9895.22)"," And so it had me thinking about,",9893.34,9895.22
"(9895.22, 9898.68)", why what's happened over the past eight years,9895.22,9898.68
"(9898.68, 9901.02)", that we've been so productive.,9898.68,9901.02
"(9901.02, 9904.74)"," You know, a lot of our decisions were called historic",9901.02,9904.74
"(9904.74, 9906.8)", and surprising. And i think we've,9904.74,9906.8
"(9906.8, 9912.96)", been really blessed because uh the time was really really right to have those decisions plantation,9906.8,9912.96
"(9912.96, 9919.92)", agriculture was totally gone we had lengthy contested cases that were ready to be resolved,9912.96,9919.92
"(9920.48, 9925.0)", we had a really diverse a a range of commissioners as well.,9920.48,9925.0
"(9926.4, 9929.24)", And so I wanna reflect a little bit,9926.4,9929.24
"(9929.24, 9931.14)", on what did we learn over the past eight years,9929.24,9931.14
"(9931.14, 9935.26)", and how might the commission improve how it works?,9931.14,9935.26
"(9935.26, 9937.36)"," So I came up, the commission is more effective",9935.26,9937.36

"(9946.68, 9950.94)", and we have ability to address those issues over larger geographical areas.,9946.68,9950.94
"(9951.42, 9953.92)", I think those numbers drill down a little bit.,9951.42,9953.92
"(9955.54, 9958.08)"," You know, as we know, it's all frustrating that the commissioners",9955.54,9958.08
"(9958.08, 9961.82)", cannot talk to one another and only in public.,9958.08,9961.82
"(9961.82, 9966.88)", And I think some of our best work has been in some of the protracted contested,9961.82,9966.88
"(9966.88, 9973.68)", case issues when we really can sit down together and we come up with value-added products from our,9966.88,9973.68
"(9973.68, 9981.84)", different perspectives and and so uh i i think it's important to try to increase that we did,9973.68,9981.84
"(9981.84, 9985.58)", the permitted interaction group which I think is really useful.,9981.84,9985.58
"(9985.58, 9987.68)"," And I think that's an underutilized thing,",9985.58,9987.68
"(9987.68, 9990.88)", a way to have a certain number of commissioners.,9987.68,9990.88
"(9990.88, 9993.76)", And I understand the evolution of the legal issues.,9990.88,9993.76
"(9993.76, 9997.02)"," We're not doing backroom smoke-filled things, we're not.",9993.76,9997.02
"(9998.7, 10000.44)", And I think it's important for the public,9998.7,10000.44
"(10000.44, 10002.26)", to actually see us interact.,10000.44,10002.26
"(10002.26, 10005.12)", I don't think they realize after four or five hours,10002.26,10005.12
"(10005.12, 10008.3)"," of public testimony, we don't know what we're gonna say",10005.12,10008.3
"(10008.3, 10009.72)", to each other yet.,10008.3,10009.72
"(10009.72, 10012.86)"," You know, the show hasn't really even started yet.",10009.72,10012.86
"(10012.86, 10015.38)", So I think the interaction between the commissioners,10012.86,10015.38
"(10015.38, 10016.42)", is really important.,10015.38,10016.42
"(10018.1, 10022.96)", And that the issue of the contested case issue,10018.1,10022.96
"(10022.96, 10026.18)"," and where that is, I understand why it's there.",10022.96,10026.18
"(10026.18, 10028.74)"," I'm not suggesting, but broken.",10026.18,10028.74
"(10028.74, 10030.42)", It's a broken system.,10028.74,10030.42
"(10030.42, 10033.26)"," It does allow us, you guys were",10030.42,10033.26
"(10033.26, 10036.0)", on Kauai when we did the Wai'aleale stream.,10033.26,10036.0
"(10036.0, 10039.38)", Four or five hours of pretty heated public testimony.,10036.0,10039.38
"(10039.38, 10042.0)", We had just started deliberations.,10039.38,10042.0
"(10042.0, 10044.34)", Someone called for a contested case.,10042.0,10044.34
"(10044.34, 10046.24)", Everything stopped. No more discussion. It turned out that entity did not even started deliberations someone called for a contested case everything stopped no more,10044.34,10046.24
"(10046.24, 10053.68)", discussion and it turned out that entity did not even have you know the proper stay standing,10046.24,10053.68
"(10054.56, 10061.6)", so I think there's we should can really think about how we reform the contested case,10054.56,10061.6
"(10062.64, 10065.9)", because I think if the commission and staff have time,10062.64,10065.9
"(10067.6, 10070.5)", for a couple months to try to work out a compromise,10067.6,10070.5
"(10070.5, 10073.34)", and work with stakeholders and then come back,10070.5,10073.34
"(10073.34, 10075.76)"," and maybe make a decision,",10073.34,10075.76
"(10075.76, 10078.34)", I think we can resolve a lot of that stuff.,10075.76,10078.34
"(10079.58, 10081.44)"," People want to contest the case, that's fine.",10079.58,10081.44
"(10081.44, 10082.86)", There are advantages.,10081.44,10082.86
"(10082.86, 10086.48)", We get to sit together and deal with it takes too,10082.86,10086.48
"(10086.48, 10093.68)", long it's too expensive uh legal issues and we might not even agree with the hearings officers,10086.48,10093.68
"(10093.68, 10099.28)", report and end up having to go back and i think we found in numerous situations where we go back,10093.68,10099.28
"(10099.28, 10106.16)", and ask people can you rescind your contested case so we can actually sit down and talk so maybe legally,10099.28,10106.16
"(10106.16, 10112.08)", there's a two or three months time out we're not making a decision but we're going to work on the,10106.16,10112.08
"(10112.08, 10118.88)", issue come back in the public forum try again and maybe there's a way that we can actually work so,10112.08,10118.88
"(10118.88, 10125.76)", i'm not suggesting we get rid of the contested cases but uh it's time to have a kind of a serious discussion how,10118.88,10125.76
"(10125.76, 10132.8)", to reform that with stakeholders so that's one obviously adequate and timely data from staff,10125.76,10132.8
"(10132.8, 10137.84)", is critical and we're sitting with some of our best staff right here that does it i think it's,10132.8,10137.84
"(10137.84, 10147.48)"," time i know it's hard you know when i was at dofa we reorganized to have decentralized, so we could have someone on each island who had the authority and",10137.84,10147.48
"(10147.48, 10150.5)", the responsibility to make decisions.,10147.48,10150.5

"(10172.18, 10174.9)", but it's time to kind of move toward that.,10172.18,10174.9
"(10174.9, 10176.54)", We've gotten bigger now.,10174.9,10176.54

"(10187.68, 10196.16)", um the third one is you know the more we know about our stakeholders the better you know covid,10187.68,10196.16
"(10196.16, 10203.36)", has changed our public hearings forever i don't think we're ever going to go back to in in person,10196.16,10203.36
"(10203.36, 10206.16)", i think it's been an improvement we're getting testimony,10203.36,10206.16
"(10206.16, 10213.2)", from all sorts of people um it's hard for the chair to manage sometimes as a three-minute,10206.16,10213.2
"(10213.2, 10218.08)", warning and you know after four or five hours of public testimony commission has a pretty good idea,10213.2,10218.08
"(10218.08, 10226.56)", where people are and are people the same thing so i don't have any suggestions but i i think it has changed the way we'll be doing,10218.08,10226.56
"(10226.56, 10233.44)", hearings forever now and maybe there's ways to make it more efficient somehow having the,10226.56,10233.44
"(10234.24, 10240.64)", testifiers know what other people are testifying so they can consolidate maybe pre-recording,10234.24,10240.64

"(10248.96, 10250.4)", and we have to deal with that.,10248.96,10250.4

"(10266.32, 10272.32)", because of a time limit on an application to the borderland natural resources there's more water in,10266.32,10272.32
"(10272.32, 10278.16)", that drainage than any other drainage in the whole state and if we would have an ability i think,10272.32,10278.16
"(10278.16, 10285.4)"," we're trying to really look at a larger geographical area we can deal with the ecosystem issues, we can deal with the",10278.16,10285.4
"(10285.4, 10290.38)", balancing that we need to do between our public trust priorities.,10285.4,10290.38
"(10290.38, 10295.34)"," And so wherever we can, sometimes we're stuck with having to deal with a stream.",10290.38,10295.34
"(10295.34, 10299.5)"," But anyway, we can combine that within the larger area.",10295.34,10299.5
"(10299.5, 10307.4)"," And I think East Maui was a classic example. Really, we had a clean palette for almost the first time",10299.5,10307.4
"(10307.4, 10309.62)", to really implement the water code,10307.4,10309.62

"(10366.5, 10371.42)", you can never trust a federal agency to stick up for what the state's interests are. But,10366.5,10371.42
"(10371.42, 10378.38)", I still would urge in this all in concept that the state of Hawaii needs a comprehensive,10371.42,10378.38
"(10378.38, 10386.0)", legal regulatory and enforcement strategy because we have to put constant pressure and it is all about,10378.38,10386.0
"(10386.0, 10393.76)", our kuleana aquifer remediation and recovery and knock on wood once the fuel is out you know people,10386.0,10393.76
"(10393.76, 10398.56)", the energy are going to let down and we are still stuck with some of these issues that we're talking,10393.76,10398.56
"(10398.56, 10405.68)", about and so this commission unanimously recommended modifying their water permit.,10398.56,10405.68
"(10405.68, 10407.94)", Take a look at their water permit.,10405.68,10407.94

"(10443.78, 10445.92)", when the time is right and when,10443.78,10445.92
"(10445.92, 10451.28)", we know more about the monitoring data so we have a better feel of what is involved in aquifer,10445.92,10451.28
"(10451.28, 10457.28)", recovery mediation we start the public process because it will be a commission oriented where,10451.28,10457.28
"(10457.28, 10465.76)", we go out to the public and say we want to plan for aquifer recovery mediation what does it look like and i think that's the time for um,10457.28,10465.76
"(10466.96, 10471.84)", for the commission to step up in its regulatory role like i said i'm happy where we are right,10466.96,10471.84
"(10471.84, 10476.56)", now we got people's attention doh is all in and you know i've been to every one of the,10471.84,10476.56
"(10476.56, 10481.28)", f tech and all the different meetings and so we have their attention but once they,10476.56,10481.28

"(10491.96, 10494.54)", So it's important that we do that.,10491.96,10494.54

"(10566.94, 10570.68)"," You know, when we did the watershed partnerships,",10566.94,10570.68
"(10570.68, 10572.72)", we came up with the commands tax.,10570.68,10572.72
"(10572.72, 10574.94)"," I mean, we've come up with ways to do that.",10572.72,10574.94
"(10574.94, 10577.46)"," But it's important that this commission,",10574.94,10577.46
"(10577.46, 10580.02)", and maybe you can hold some workshops,10577.46,10580.02
"(10580.02, 10581.22)"," or bring some people in,",10580.02,10581.22
"(10581.22, 10584.4)", just a way to kind of have people understand.,10581.22,10584.4
"(10584.4, 10585.76)", Because you talk about money and,10584.4,10585.76
"(10585.76, 10590.48)", water people people freak out you know the counties don't want to deal with it they don't,10585.76,10590.48
"(10590.48, 10596.4)", want to raise their rates but we need to find a way that we could fund the public trust because,10590.48,10596.4
"(10596.4, 10606.4)", that's our responsibility that's kind of some suggestions i might have observations of how we've been very productive i want to thank,10596.4,10606.4
"(10606.4, 10615.36)", you all i'm not going away i'm actually chair of the malama hunua a public charter school,10606.4,10615.36
"(10615.36, 10621.12)", foundation you know we're raising money to build our school it's based on the values of ocean,10615.36,10621.12
"(10621.12, 10625.74)", navigation the kids actually we have a sublease from the LNR.,10621.12,10625.74
"(10627.3, 10628.64)", The kids are unbelievable.,10627.3,10628.64
"(10628.64, 10631.92)"," I mean, that is the next generation of leadership.",10628.64,10631.92
"(10631.92, 10634.68)", And so I'm really dedicated to try to build that school.,10631.92,10634.68
"(10634.68, 10636.48)", And it happens to be in Waimanalo.,10634.68,10636.48
"(10637.46, 10641.66)"," So I might be asking you guys for donations at some time,",10637.46,10641.66
"(10641.66, 10643.68)"," but it's been a pleasure, you know,",10641.66,10643.68
"(10643.68, 10646.08)"," and I was the DOFA, you know,",10643.68,10646.08
"(10646.08, 10647.6)", and this was maybe when we were starting,10646.08,10647.6
"(10647.6, 10650.62)"," the East Maui Partnership,",10647.6,10650.62
"(10650.62, 10652.5)"," and that was when Waihole was just going,",10650.62,10652.5
"(10652.5, 10654.74)"," and I was going, God, these commissioners,",10652.5,10654.74
"(10654.74, 10657.4)", they're fighting over this drop in the bucket,10654.74,10657.4
"(10657.4, 10660.04)", when we're dealing with all this source water stuff.,10657.4,10660.04
"(10660.04, 10663.78)"," I said, one of these days, I'm gonna be on that commission.",10660.04,10663.78
"(10663.78, 10665.76)", And we have so many converts,10663.78,10665.76
"(10665.76, 10670.72)", now and watershed protection i feel very comfortable especially with commissioner hannah's,10665.76,10670.72
"(10670.72, 10676.08)", i don't need to like i don't need to spout off any time but it's been great thank you very much keep,10670.72,10676.08
"(10676.08, 10680.88)", up the great work uh you're doing important and the water code is probably one of the most,10676.08,10680.88
"(10681.44, 10685.68)", innovative and aspirational water legislations in the world,10681.44,10685.68
"(10690.64, 10698.08)", it really is it's not it's a challenge to implement but you know i've worked all over the us and internationally and um when i asked the maui chair comparing california and hawaii,10690.64,10698.08
"(10698.08, 10706.96)", he obviously doesn't know much about hawaii yet because we are so far ahead of what they're doing in California about regulatory,10698.08,10706.96
"(10706.96, 10714.0)", structures and Indigenous rights. So it's been a pleasure. Thank you all for your work. Stay happy,10706.96,10714.0
"(10714.0, 10721.92)", and healthy. Thank you. Before I know that Jonathan and Lucienne are also on Zoom and,10714.0,10721.92
"(10721.92, 10726.88)", probably want to say something so go ahead jonathan,10721.92,10726.88
"(10731.92, 10737.12)", aloha my kakou commissioner is my name for the record is jonathan rikiki shoyer and while i often appear in front of you as a testifier on behalf of dhhl or other entities this is just,10731.92,10737.12
"(10737.12, 10745.08)", my personal testimony um just wanting to thank commissioner buck for his years of service and say from the perspective of somebody,10737.12,10745.08
"(10745.08, 10752.78)", who's been observing this commission for almost three decades now that I just want to highlight,10745.08,10752.78
"(10752.78, 10758.08)", three things which came out in in his very thoughtful closing remarks that I think really mark,10752.78,10758.08
"(10758.08, 10766.08)", something very special and at times completely unique that commissioner buck has brought to this commission,10758.08,10766.08
"(10766.08, 10771.92)", first is really the matter he last talked about he's always approached the commission with an,10766.08,10771.92
"(10771.92, 10780.0)", understanding of how innovative and how unusual and how profound the water code is and he's really,10771.92,10780.0
"(10780.0, 10787.36)", sort of um come with that understanding that it means a huge deal to walk into a role of,10780.0,10787.36
"(10787.36, 10790.9)", having to try and implement and uphold that.,10787.36,10790.9
"(10790.9, 10794.52)", That relates to my second thing that I wanted to highlight about his tremendous service,10790.9,10794.52
"(10794.52, 10800.78)", is that I certainly have not always agreed with some of the decisions that he's made.,10794.52,10800.78
"(10800.78, 10818.0)"," But unlike some other people I've observed over three decades, there was never a question in my mind that first and foremost, he understood the duties of a trustee, which first is duties to be faithful to the trust corpus itself.",10800.78,10818.0
"(10818.0, 10825.2)"," I might have disagreed with a decision he reached, but it was always in trying to further what was best for the resource",10818.0,10825.2
"(10825.2, 10830.16)", and best for the implementation of the code. And that really increased the amount of trust that,10825.2,10830.16
"(10830.16, 10836.48)"," this body has had over the time of his service. And finally, and this is also something he remarked",10830.16,10836.48
"(10836.48, 10842.82)"," on, his continual drumbeat about us needing to connect how we manage our forested watersheds",10836.48,10842.82
"(10842.82, 10851.12)", and how we manage the water derived from them is an incredibly important message. And I think that as we slowly make progress on that over the,10842.82,10851.12
"(10851.12, 10856.64)"," next years and decades, his voice in the wilderness will be one that will continue to",10851.12,10856.64
"(10856.64, 10863.42)"," guide us and be seen as a guiding light in that process. So I'm just personally very,",10856.64,10863.42
"(10863.42, 10865.44)", very grateful for your service,10863.42,10865.44
"(10865.44, 10869.84)", and for your closing remarks. Thank you for the opportunity to offer these few comments. Aloha.,10865.44,10869.84
"(10870.86, 10874.64)"," Thank you, Jonathan. That was very well said. Thank you so much.",10870.86,10874.64
"(10875.3, 10889.92)"," Lucianne, I see you on the call as well. Indeed. Mahalo. And and ah thank you all thank you all for a long day thank you all for um the service that each",10875.3,10889.92
"(10889.92, 10896.8)", of the members puts into this very important board but you know i i've known mike since back in the,10889.92,10896.8
"(10896.8, 10927.08)"," days of of dofar and uh uh you know we've had discussions about forestry issues and this and that because I I've been here watching these meetings for about 3 decades, too, and those of us who represent, you know, groups that are trying to be part of the kind of watchdog for the public trust always appreciate when there's a person who's willing to listen.",10896.8,10927.08
"(10927.54, 10932.82)"," And like Jonathan says, you don't always come to the same agreement. In the end, that is not",10927.54,10932.82
"(10932.82, 10941.38)"," the whole point. The point is, is that there is a respectful and engaged dialogue. And Mike just",10932.82,10941.38
"(10941.38, 10950.0)", really has gone the extra mile in every facet of his service on the commission.,10941.38,10950.0
"(10950.0, 10965.98)", And I have to say you you're closing words Mike. I agree a 100% with every thoughtful suggestion you brought up. are on the minds of all of us who have been watching our water policy evolve from you,10950.0,10965.98
"(10965.98, 10972.38)", know the 1980s when it first kind of took form and all of these are important things,10965.98,10972.38
"(10972.38, 10979.36)", um i i joined with jonathan connecting our watersheds and caring for the whole watersheds,10972.38,10979.36
"(10979.36, 10984.42)", and involving the communities in that caring is one of the most important things that we,10979.36,10984.42
"(10984.42, 10985.92)", can do if we really,10984.42,10985.92
"(10985.92, 10991.6)", don't want to be fighting over less and less water in the future we need to envision a future when we,10985.92,10991.6
"(10991.6, 10998.72)", as we grow water and that means cooperating with nature i also very very much appreciate,10991.6,10998.72
"(10998.72, 11006.82)", your remarks about working with stakeholders to try to avoid contested cases being the only option.,10998.72,11006.82
"(11007.38, 11012.24)"," Now, obviously, you know, I've been party to many contested cases. Sometimes they are the",11007.38,11012.24
"(11012.24, 11021.0)"," best option because the story is just too full to tell through even, you know, meeting a few times.",11012.24,11021.0
"(11021.0, 11028.78)", But even you look at Nava'eha and working towards some of these brokered settlement,11021.0,11028.78
"(11028.78, 11035.88)"," agreements, it saved everybody time. It is not perfect. We do need more enforcement of what's",11028.78,11035.88
"(11035.88, 11054.0)", on paper so it doesn't become just a good looking decision on paper that on the ground where's the water. But the idea of bringing people together when possible to find common ground over a shared resource.,11035.88,11054.0
"(11054.0, 11068.58)"," I I think should be very, very high on the purview of the commission like this, and I applaud your efforts. I you know you've made many suggestions to that that um uh that type of",11054.0,11068.58
"(11068.58, 11076.02)", resolution and um uh director Chang is really heading in that way as well your staff is heading,11068.58,11076.02
"(11076.02, 11081.78)", in that way so just from the bottom of our hearts in our communities you know most people are not,11076.02,11081.78
"(11081.78, 11106.6)"," like me they're they're not like kind of retired you know, just dedicated to sign up to wait in line to testify for hours, but they do care to see some of these dreams come true and do many other",11081.78,11106.6
"(11106.6, 11113.74)", wonderful things for our community. So God bless you and thank you for your service.,11106.6,11113.74

"(11125.36, 11129.6)", gonna go around either staff or commission if you want to say something to mike as well,11125.36,11129.6
"(11134.48, 11140.4)", aurora i didn't draft anything oh that's okay from the heart from the heart from,11134.48,11140.4
"(11141.04, 11146.64)", pretty bad at impromptu speaking um but i i do appreciate the opportunity i had,11141.04,11146.64
"(11146.64, 11152.96)", to get to know you on the permitted interaction group and also you know sort of the the eight,11146.64,11152.96
"(11152.96, 11159.6)", blood junior member on the commission really watching you kind of be the tip of the spirit,11152.96,11159.6
"(11159.6, 11171.06)"," you know the first person to make a motion and to know, because I think I first interacted with you through when I was working in conservation, so I knew your name and you work in Forestry.",11159.6,11171.06
"(11171.78, 11175.48)", And to understand how like the role you played in the watershed partnerships.,11171.78,11175.48
"(11176.68, 11188.0)"," And kind of this stitching together for me of forest and water and then to be able to work with you in the permitted interaction group. And oh my gosh, like the phone calls, the text messages, the Zoom calls, the meetings,",11176.68,11188.0
"(11188.0, 11195.0)"," I mean the energy with which you attended every single, I don't know how many hours long meetings and read,",11188.0,11195.0

"(11205.92, 11212.56)", i think for me um i don't know it's really great to see that as a model of this is what public,11205.92,11212.56
"(11212.56, 11217.36)", service is because i don't think the public really understands not everybody does it but,11212.56,11217.36
"(11217.36, 11223.28)", i think you set i think a high bar at least for me personally and how much to research and,11217.36,11223.28
"(11223.92, 11225.5)"," investigate and to learn more about um you said you came from a family of lawyers and that's why at least for me personally, and how much to research and investigate",11223.92,11225.5

"(11397.0, 11403.0)"," I said, no, no, he's okay.",11397.0,11403.0
"(11403.0, 11408.14)"," Anyway, Mike, thank you very much for being you.",11403.0,11408.14
"(11408.14, 11418.74)"," And thank you very much for, I guess, helping me see a far broader perspective of what needs",11408.14,11418.74
"(11418.74, 11426.24)", to be encompassed in managing and ensuring that we have a sustainable water supply,11418.74,11426.24
"(11427.28, 11433.84)", that provides for a healthy community in terms of growth so again mike thank you very much,11427.28,11433.84
"(11436.8, 11446.32)", yeah uh my carpets have crossed many times uh prior to being on the Water Commission and during these last seven years of overlap.,11436.8,11446.32
"(11447.52, 11450.76)", And I have no doubt they'll cross again in the future.,11447.52,11450.76
"(11452.0, 11454.98)", And there are four things that I've really come to appreciate,11452.0,11454.98
"(11454.98, 11458.52)", in this term of service is you really love Hawaii,11454.98,11458.52
"(11458.52, 11462.6)", and your Ola Ha'aina factor metric is really up there,11458.52,11462.6
"(11462.6, 11466.08)", and we really appreciate that and you're courageous about,11462.6,11466.08
"(11466.08, 11473.84)", it you put it on the line and you fight for it so uh that's awesome uh you you you show up,11466.08,11473.84
"(11474.72, 11481.2)", you know uh you have a you bring a lot to the table when you do uh you are prepared and you,11474.72,11481.2
"(11481.2, 11492.08)", engage and you're gonna take the time to take're going to take a seat on this table you know be there be present and and be ready and and do your job so uh you've done,11481.2,11492.08
"(11492.08, 11498.86)", really well and set a model and example for all of us as you come here um you don't know a lot,11492.08,11498.86
"(11498.86, 11506.0)"," but yet you're very respectful of everybody else it's a. And as Wayne has said,",11498.86,11506.0
"(11506.0, 11509.04)", you recognize that these decisions have to balance a lot,11506.0,11509.04
"(11509.04, 11512.22)"," of interests you have, you have some others have other",11509.04,11512.22
"(11512.24, 11518.42)"," perspectives, and those focus great sense of respect for your",11512.24,11518.42
"(11518.42, 11522.32)", peers and for the testifiers and the diverse constituencies out,11518.42,11522.32
"(11522.32, 11526.04)", there that need to be served. So appreciate that.,11522.32,11526.04
"(11526.04, 11531.04)"," And finally, you made a special effort to be transparent.",11526.04,11531.04
"(11531.38, 11536.38)"," And you kept those humongous decisions,",11531.38,11536.38
"(11536.38, 11539.86)"," you know, East Maui and Nau'eha and so forth.",11536.38,11539.86
"(11539.86, 11541.06)"," You know, you were the one",11539.86,11541.06
"(11541.06, 11543.54)", who fought for executive summaries.,11541.06,11543.54
"(11543.54, 11545.68)", So the public really needs to not get mired in all the details or just the one who fought for executive summaries. So the public really needs to not,11543.54,11545.68
"(11545.68, 11551.2)", get mired in all the details or just the one line item that affects them and so forth. They need to,11545.68,11551.2
"(11551.2, 11558.24)"," see the big picture. And I think it really helps people. It creates the common ground, the higher,",11551.2,11558.24
"(11558.24, 11565.76)", higher sense of vision and value. It helps bring people together. So it it's it's considerate of them to say they should they,11558.24,11565.76
"(11565.76, 11571.68)", need to know but it's also unifying for those that can share this and i think that's helped us,11565.76,11571.68
"(11571.68, 11577.76)", a lot and appreciate that so uh i hope part of your future is not just building a wonderful,11571.68,11577.76
"(11577.76, 11585.12)"," school uh but but also uh maybe playing a little music oh Oh, yeah. I'll let you. Thank you so much.",11577.76,11585.12
"(11585.12, 11587.22)", I'm going to let Kaleo have the last words.,11585.12,11587.22
"(11587.22, 11592.56)", It's both have come to know each other well.,11587.22,11592.56
"(11592.56, 11600.38)"," All I can say is from me, I've always, I think it's,",11592.56,11600.38
"(11600.38, 11604.1)"," what I appreciate is sort of this full circle,",11600.38,11604.1
"(11604.1, 11606.36)"," being part of the, you never leave the LNR.",11604.1,11606.36
"(11606.36, 11612.24)"," I mean, I say that because I can speak that firsthand.",11606.36,11612.24
"(11612.24, 11616.96)", And it is a very different perspective to sit on this side of the table versus that,11612.24,11616.96
"(11616.96, 11619.52)", side of the table.,11616.96,11619.52
"(11619.52, 11630.72)", Because we do have this awesome kuleana that the decisions we make have broad implications far beyond us,11619.52,11630.72
"(11630.72, 11634.48)", and our generation but generations to come.,11630.72,11634.48
"(11634.48, 11649.6)"," And I have just appreciated watching you afar sitting on here, but as well as when you were with DLNR, water and land are inseparable.",11634.48,11649.6
"(11649.6, 11658.66)"," And sitting here, we have the ability to always ensure that we are taking into consideration",11649.6,11658.66
"(11658.66, 11672.0)"," all of that and how intertwined and interconnected and that we as decision makers cannot separate that, but ensure that we are considering all of those.",11658.66,11672.0
"(11672.0, 11688.4)"," And I always talk to the staff about staying in our lane, but I think as a decision maker, we have to take the much broader view, and I've appreciated the lens upon which you have brought to the Water Commission just that",11672.0,11688.4
"(11690.14, 11698.36)", the broader kuleana of recognizing again that our decisions have broad implications but that it is,11690.14,11698.36
"(11698.36, 11708.48)", um it is a very heavy responsibility and you have worn that well and have accepted that with such honor and,11698.36,11708.48
"(11708.48, 11714.4)", privilege and so it likewise it has been a privilege for me to share this time with you,11708.48,11714.4
"(11714.4, 11729.36)", together as short of that as it is but we're going to probably see you on that side of the table you know yeah who knows maybe as a hearing officer or as a i mean you can help to,11714.4,11729.36
"(11729.36, 11737.6)", you can help to to correct this broken contested case hearing process but um like neil our pals,11729.36,11737.6
"(11737.6, 11747.6)"," will cross again so thank you very much yeah i mean i'm on behalf of the staff, you've always been really respectful of the team",11737.6,11747.6
"(11747.6, 11749.6)", and super supportive.,11747.6,11749.6
"(11749.6, 11759.9)", And it's been really great to work with you for four and a half years of your tenure.,11749.6,11759.9
"(11759.9, 11767.64)"," I really just, I mean, everybody's kind of touched on your great attributes and the work that you've done",11759.9,11767.64
"(11767.64, 11770.34)", on the space that you've held and you've held it well.,11767.64,11770.34
"(11772.02, 11776.26)", But I really just appreciated like your storytelling,11772.02,11776.26
"(11776.26, 11781.04)", in space and kind of connecting people through this scene,11776.26,11781.04
"(11781.04, 11787.44)", versus kind of using the scene from a place of power you really found a way to um make,11781.04,11787.44
"(11787.44, 11793.44)", this of people's you know the community and space and and have been a staunch advocate for the,11787.44,11793.44
"(11793.44, 11801.44)", public trust um but also holding ourselves as trusted accountable um and to look and innovate,11793.44,11801.44
"(11801.44, 11806.04)", and and continue to push push that flow so i've appreciated that and I've learned a lot from you.,11801.44,11806.04
"(11806.04, 11808.76)"," And yeah, it's the beginning of another story.",11806.04,11808.76
"(11809.56, 11812.24)", So good luck and we will miss you.,11809.56,11812.24
"(11812.4, 11813.92)", We will miss you on this spot.,11812.4,11813.92
"(11813.92, 11817.16)", I wish you'd replace me with someone who has a little bit of knowledge.,11813.92,11817.16
"(11819.36, 11823.36)"," You know, I unfortunately have zero clout in that process.",11819.36,11823.36
"(11823.36, 11828.22)"," And so, you know, we look forward to you know talking to me.",11823.36,11828.22
"(11828.98, 11854.32)", Commission again on his expertise in this space and it really helps build the capacity of our staff um and our agency um and and i think we do a lot so little um and and and,11828.98,11854.32
"(11855.2, 11859.76)", and build that trust over time yeah with community yeah i think it'd be really he'll be really,11855.2,11859.76
"(11859.76, 11867.18)"," interesting just the history of the water code you, what happened between 78 and 81, and how was",11859.76,11867.18
"(11867.18, 11873.56)"," this established, all the different compromises and things to make it, because people are",11867.18,11873.56
"(11873.56, 11876.04)"," going to go after the water code, I think, eventually.",11873.56,11876.04
"(11876.04, 11881.2)"," Because let's say in Lahaina, we made some pretty big decisions that pissed some people",11876.04,11881.2
"(11881.2, 11882.2)", off.,11881.2,11882.2
"(11882.2, 11883.2)", They were not ready.,11882.2,11883.2
"(11883.2, 11890.24)"," And yet, I don't think people realize what the water code was and i think over the last eight years we're really implementing it we've had an",11883.2,11890.24
"(11890.24, 11895.12)", opportunity that other commissioners haven't to really implement it for the first time over large,11890.24,11895.12
"(11895.12, 11902.72)", areas and so i i think people are now just like thinking about it and what it means and uh yeah,11895.12,11902.72
"(11902.72, 11909.0)", so i i think he'll he'll bring an incredibly useful perspective because he was there during that time.,11902.72,11909.0
"(11909.0, 11917.0)"," I wasn't, you know, between 78 and 81 I was here, but I wasn't part of any of that process.",11909.0,11917.0
"(11917.0, 11932.9)"," But I don't know anyone's really kind of documented that, you know, all the push pull and the whole room issues at home and how did they actually come up with that, because I think eventually someone needs to tell that story, because it is a unique story.",11917.0,11932.9
"(11932.96, 11933.68)", He wrote a book.,11932.96,11933.68
"(11933.98, 11934.98)", yeah but.,11933.98,11934.98
"(11936.56, 11937.58)", it's a tough read.,11936.56,11937.58
"(11942.92, 11947.92)", He will definitely add a different dynamic to this commission yeah yeah we're,11942.92,11947.92
"(11947.92, 11955.92)", gonna have to put a special seat yeah in the way and the family no i undoubtedly um,11947.92,11955.92
"(11957.6, 11961.84)", big shoes to fill you bring a very different perspective than he does but,11957.6,11961.84
"(11962.48, 11966.48)", you know i think that is as you say that is the wonderful,11962.48,11966.48
"(11966.48, 11973.36)", value i mean we were all here when we had land boards and water commissions that were very,11966.48,11973.36
"(11973.36, 11980.8)", different composition that didn't necessarily reflect this kind of wealth of expertise and,11973.36,11980.8
"(11980.8, 11988.08)"," community so yeah we've come a long way. One other suggestion I forgot, that because of Zoom,",11980.8,11988.08
"(11988.08, 11991.86)", there should be at least like once every quarter,11988.08,11991.86
"(11991.86, 11994.36)", that the commissioners could come together.,11991.86,11994.36
"(11994.36, 11996.96)", So you actually can be in the same room,11994.36,11996.96
"(11996.96, 11998.76)", because it's so much easier to go on Zoom.,11996.96,11998.76
"(11998.76, 12001.32)"," We all know that and we prefer that mostly,",11998.76,12001.32
"(12001.32, 12002.6)"," but especially when they buy,",12001.32,12002.6
"(12002.6, 12005.6)", it's really important for people to sit face to face,12002.6,12005.6
"(12010.24, 12016.16)", i think more people have been trying to make an effort so yeah but thank you for bringing creating the opportunity for everybody to be here today yeah don't do it again,12010.24,12016.16
"(12018.08, 12030.08)", all right with that being said the commission meeting is closed.,12018.08,12030.08
