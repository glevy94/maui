concerned about the potential for downstream scour right below and is that an issue and why it's not, and how -- how the design of the structures addresses that. So I'm not sure who the best person to -- to respond would be. Maybe PE.

**MR. EVANS:** Yeah, I guess I can take that. I'm with Austin Tsutsumi, the civil engineer on this project. We -- you know, it's not gonna speed up the flow beyond this -- this bank. It's going to -- just in the area where -- where it interacts with the hardening, it'll -- it'll accelerate in that area, but then we used a roughened grouted riprap edge so that it mitigates the velocity increase there, and we don't expect any increase in velocity downstream. And we did a hydraulic analysis throughout the area from upstream of the project through to downstream to verify those hydraulic conditions.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** I think just -- yeah, it just helps to know -- how you guys have thought about it and considered, so thank you.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Any other questions or comments? Yes, Wayne.

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** Just a quick question. The 600 cubic yards that will be excavated, to meet the Forestry requests of minimizing the movement of soil, how would that be reused or recycled? Would it be on-site?

**MR. EVANS:** The 600 --
