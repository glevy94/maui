The availability of groundwater differs amongst the hydrologic settings. In the freshwater lens setting, saltwater rise and encroachment, reduction of groundwater discharge to the ocean, and also to springs where there's cap rock, are the principal consequences that are going to limit groundwater availability in that area.

For dike-impounded and thickly saturated aquifers, the principal consequences limiting availability include water level decline and reduction of discharge to streams and springs. For upgrading aquifers such as the Schofield Aquifer, Schofield high-level groundwater would be reduction of flow to adjacent aquifers.

These consequences depend on the magnitude of the withdrawals and can change with changes in recharge caused by land use or climate. Collaboration between management and science can work towards a balance between groundwater withdrawal and the need to limit the consequences. This study demonstrated how groundwater modeling can help quantify the consequences of groundwater withdrawal for a certain set of situations. If water managers have a certain set of limits that they donâ€™t want to overstep, science can run scenarios to figure out what the available groundwater is under those limitations or, alternatively, if...
