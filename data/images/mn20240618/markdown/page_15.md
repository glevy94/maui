**RYAN IMATA:** No, again I don't think anything pertaining to permit approvals changes, the only thing that changes is the delegation. I think I mentioned in this submittal that there's two sides of it, there's a side that wants the bifurcation because they want to be able to drill a well and to better assess what are going to be the hydrologic impacts of pumping the well. Because you can do a Chapter 343, you can predict a Ka Pa‘akai Analysis, you can say that but until you pump a well you're not going to be able to collect data that addresses those kinds of issues. Some agencies want to have the permit bifurcated so that they can drill the well first and assess, other agencies may want to make sure that they have the well and the pump permits in hand so that they don't invest like $2 million dollars in a well and then they can't get the pump installation permit. What I'm proposing is flexible and allowing both of those to happen. In a Water Management Area, clearly to get a pump installation permit, you need a water use permit. Those things will come to the Commission anyway, so I think that addresses the bifurcation in terms of like in management areas and non-management areas and our flexibility in allowing what I think people are looking for. I hope that answers your question.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** Sorry, when I said bifurcated, I kind of meant like designated and non-designated. Say I'm an applicant, my pump is less than 27 gpm (gallons per minute). Is there a clear way that we can understand what you're proposing? Like okay, so it's less than 27 and you're located in Wai‘anae - okay, well it's going to be mostly papered on the bulletin but it's not going to have to come before the Commission. Correct?

**RYAN IMATA:** So, Wai‘anae is not a management area, right? That's what you're saying, so non-management areas.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** I'm thinking about it, making it easier to understand from the permit applicant side, what that routing is.

**RYAN IMATA:** I get that you want to make it easier, but it is a complex issue because is it a non-management area, management area? Is it a domestic use, is it a non-domestic use? Is it below 27 or is it under 27? If it's below 27 and it's for individual domestic use in a non-management area, then it's delegated approval to the Chair. If it's below 27 in a non-management area and it's used for industrial water bottling then it does come to the Commission.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** I think what could be made clear is just “how this is the existing workflow” and “this is how the workflow will change” and “this is how it will improve permit processing time.” Sorry, maybe you're thinking about it in terms of your workload, but I'm thinking about it in terms of like there's a lot of text and if there is a clear diagram of the changes being suggested, I think it would be helpful. I’m not asking for it now, but if that could be part of the staff’s four tasks like clarifying what that workflow, that modified workflow is, I think that would help in making.
