Regarding the public review draft and our timeline for approval. So as our next steps to the public review draft, we are very close to releasing it online. We anticipate making that publicly available by the end of next week on the Board of Water Supply project webpage. We also are underway in terms of presenting the public review draft to the district's three neighborhood boards, and we'll also be holding a virtual community meeting on the draft on August 24th from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m.

And lastly, I wanted to turn it over to -- back to Barry to provide a little bit more of a detail on -- on the approval process with the city and the state commission. Thank you.

MR. USAGAWA: Thank you, Abbey. Just wanted to get through the adoption process. So once we do the public review draft, and we obtain the comments and revise the plan accordingly, you know, we then submit it -- we present it to our board, we present it to PPP, and the water commission, but -- you know, I apologize for the complexity of the flowchart on the bottom right, but just to explain the city council adoption. And this is adopted by ordinance.

There are five touchpoints. There are three readings, first, second, and third reading. The third reading is adoption. The first reading is just an introduction.
