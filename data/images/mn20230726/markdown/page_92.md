CHAIR CHANG: The agenda. I mean, Neil, is that what you wanted? Is that what you asked?

COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: (Inaudible.)

CHAIR CHANG: Okay, all right. So hearing no other public testimony, no other -- any other questions from the commission?

(No response.)

CHAIR CHANG: I am going to close --

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Chair.

CHAIR CHANG: Go ahead. Yes.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: I do have one. So this is addressing Susan again because of the first item you brought up -- and maybe Commissioner Ho. My understanding is that Dr. Brewer's findings, once released, sort of sit in the lap of what DOH takes care of. What role or what important insight do we as commissioners make when we're often tasked with water quantity issues? You know, how do we -- how do we use this information to guide our efforts? Is it relevant? You know, how do -- because it seems like important information. I was reading it last night.

COMMISSIONER HO: So this assessment was really done to help CDC in its efforts.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Okay.

COMMISSIONER HO: So that was the sole purpose for the drafting of this document. CDC will take this document.
