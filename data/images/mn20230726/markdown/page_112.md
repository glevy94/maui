model, so there is -- this is what will happen ultimately if the 2001 to 2010 conditions were kept steady forever. It -- there's no time dimension on this simulation. So I couldn't say that this would happen in a hundred years or ten years or 20 years or something like that.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Okay.

MR. IZUKA: And -- yeah. And the other thing is that that -- that also means that the wells didn't go in a -- in the way that they actually did, you know, over time.

Oh, the other thing that I wanted to say is so the change in the freshwater-saltwater interface is going to increase -- it's going to -- the change is gonna happen quickly at the beginning and slow down as you approach the -- you know, the steady state. The -- it may be very difficult to see changes as the -- as these freshwater -- as this -- as the system settles into a new steady state.

And the third thing is that, most likely, the aquifer is not at its steady state because new wells are being put in all the time, right?

CHAIR CHANG: Okay. Larry, your hand is up. Go ahead.

COMMISSIONER MIIKE: Yeah. How does this affect current estimates of sustainable yield, and what's the timeframe in which we'd have to change them?

DR. IZUKA: Well, I guess my -- my take on the
