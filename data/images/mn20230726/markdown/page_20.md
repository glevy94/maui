Donald Hampton. I work for Navy region of Hawai‘i, overseeing the tank closure plan for Navy Region of Hawai‘i. The slide you're seeing right now is a brief synopsis of all of the products we have submitted along the timeline that we have submitted them. We are making progress going forward. We're working with regulators through ongoing meetings, responding to the requests for additional information so we can provide amplifying information to make informed decisions. We're on a good glide path right now, and we are moving the tank closure plan forward. As you're aware, we're still in the planning phase of the tank closure plan, and it's scheduled to start once defueling is completed with this last spec of it.

I'll pause there on this slide for any questions.

All of this information which you'll see on the next slide is in the -- I'll pause here. Any questions on this?
