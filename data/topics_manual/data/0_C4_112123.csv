Informational Briefing on Well Construction and Pump Installation Permits PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Ryan Imata, CWRM Hydrologic Program Manager
Staff provided a thorough overview of the current permitting process for well construction and pump installation. He expounded on the application review process, post-construction review process, and possible next steps.
In your existing process, what you've covered to date the process, there is no public review?
We publish it in our bulletin and anybody that inquiries about it can have our application and look at it and provide comments to us, but we don't write letters to anyone specifically in the public unless there are certain conditions. No, I can't think of any conditions that require us to, I mean it's just very specific people that we might ask questions of.
So, there's no opportunity for public? I think that that was part of the comment that was raised on Hāpuna and that's part of my concern too is just this, a delegation that doesn't provide opportunities for public oversight. That's why I wanted this to come back to this Commission.
What I was going to say was that the wells are published in our bulletin and anyone that has our bulletin is aware of wells that are on our application, that we're looking at the time.
Looking at your list of agencies that you sent, there's a letter from Kali Watson from DHHL saying that they’d like earlier review. You don't automatically send DHHL any of these reports?
We don't send them applications for wells. We do send DHHL all water use permit applications.
It would be a simple matter just to include them in that list though, right?
It's just putting them on our header and then having our secretary email it to them for comments.
Now in non-water management areas, once you approve this permit they can go ahead and pump up to the capacity of the well?
You'll see as we go through the review process if we do approve the pump capacity then they can pump up to the capacity of the pump.
I have a little problem with that. As long as it's well within the sustainable yield of an aquifer, you routinely approve these or do you match that to what they claim they're going to use it for? I come in and say I want five million gallons. Do they have to provide a justification for the amount for the capacity?
Good question. In a non-management area no, you don't need to justify the use as reasonable and beneficial; however, we do look at the pump capacity with respect to a couple of things. We look to see if the total MGD is within the sustainable yield and again remember that delegation of authority is only for wells that are in aquifers that reported pumpage is below 70% of sustainable yield. So, somebody can't just come in. I'll give you a good example, Mahi Pono came in for an application and this is where I said we have that provision for pump replacements where we're exempt from getting a permit from our office. But I have a problem with that because now Mahi Pono wants to put in pumps that would far exceed the sustainable yield of Pāʻia, so no. I think that you're absolutely spot on. If the pump capacity shows that it's going to exceed sustainable yield, I think we have to present it to the Commission.
That's not my issue. My issue is that even if it's well within the sustainable yield, if someone comes in for five million or some large amount I would think that they'd have to justify why they're asking for such a large amount. I can see an exemption for a homeowner with a home well but someone could come in for such a large amount and we don't do any review of why they're asking for it, I really have problems with that.
As we go through, there’s one thing that will address your concern. The other thing is Kaleo has been very mindful about looking at our applications and saying, hey this quantity doesn't seem appropriate for what they're proposing to do. So, we go back and we ask and then we will present it to you guys if we need to in that case.
The code and the definition of wells talks about that wells are supposed to be evaluated for reasonable, beneficial. It doesn't say whether in or outside of management area and so as Ryan said oftentimes in our review or at least my review when an applicant checks what they've planned to use the well for, there are some basic categories and some estimated end-use based on pump capacity. Oftentimes your pump capacity is usually larger than what you anticipate your end-use being and in that analysis we get really good at understanding standards and comparing it to water system standards of the county or what this Commission has already approved in prior decision making as it relates to reasonable, beneficial. Staff as well as I have already put on those goggles, basically your goggles that on prior decisions, for example 2,500 gallons per acre per day for ag. In scenarios like that if those numbers are way off as Ryan said historically or at least in the years that I've been here, I've challenged staff to ask the applicant are you being efficient? Why is this number so high? If there's uncertainty or concern, I've always proposed to bring it to the Commission because it's something beyond the normal routine. Again, based on internal staff review and our expertise as staff. I will say as Ryan is going to get to it, a majority of the well applications that we do receive are small capacity, almost domestic wells where there isn't service by other large public water systems. Taking on the kuleana of owning and operating a well is a big one and costs a lot of money not only in the initial investment but also long-term operation and management. It's a long-winded answer. I think if we can get through the presentation and highlight all the stats then you can start to ask additional questions. The concept of five million we haven't seen, I haven't seen one well come across my desk for five million. A lot of times it's pump replacements for these shafts that are causing us pause, but all of those as Ryan talked about, we are wanting to bring back to the Commission because those are old. The shafts don't meet standards today. They were done before the code adopted these standards. All of these things brought together, we want to make sure that the Commission is aware of their obligation to protect the resource and also ensure that it meets reasonable, beneficial use standards. I would just suggest if we can get through it, I think it'll help inform the dialogue at the end.
I wanted to provide some context. The reason why I asked for this informational briefing is one, I also sit as the chair of the board of Land and Natural Resources. There's a lot of delegation that comes, but it always is to the chairperson. I had asked the staff to provide me background information. I said and this was in light of Commissioner Katayama's inquiry about ministerial versus discretionary so they provided me the 1997. This was the delegation authority and for me times have changed since 1997 and even in DLNR we do annual delegations. The different divisions will come to the board every year asking for a delegation to approve exemptions for EAs or things like that, so I felt very uncomfortable with a 1997 delegation. I also felt that that should be to the chairperson unless there's something specifically in writing from the chairperson to the deputy. Similarly, I also felt that I really wanted the Water Commission to vet this out because a lot has changed since 1997, Ka Paʻakai expectations by community, the more information we're realizing about the interaction between groundwater and surface water that I thought that this required a much broader dialogue with the Commission. And as Ryan said a lot of the permits that they're getting is Hawaiian Paradise and maybe that's an exception, but I thought it was still worthy for this Commission to have that discussion and then revisit the question of is it appropriate for delegation, do you want everything to come to the Commission or are there certain things that you're willing to delegate? At Hāpuna there were some members of the community who raised the whole question about the delegation and the well permit approval process so that's the backdrop of why this is coming. There's no decision today. Ryan, thank you for the comprehensive overview of your process and the considerations.
I'm pretty satisfied with the explanation. I think since it's such an old policy that you question, I think you should bring a recommendation to us about what you should do about it.
Okay that's fair.
The types of permits that are being delegated, I don’t have a...
The difference between ministerial versus discretionary because Ryan, I know that that was Commissioner Katayama’s. You just have a total number of permits or do you have a separation of the types of permits?
I kind of thought that that question was going to be asked. I can tell you just sort of anecdotally. I don't have statistics but I can tell you that you are seeing the ones that are in management area areas already which are not a lot. You can imagine water management areas they're pretty much tapped out, so we don't bring that many applications to you. Most of the applications that we do bring to you that are in that are for wells and pumps are also accompanied by a water use permit would be in Wailua and Mokuleʻia as groundwater management areas. I'd say about 50 to 60% is Hawaiian Paradise Park with another 10 or 15% being the Navy monitor wells. Aside from that, there are wells going in in Maui but again now Lahaina is a designated management area. You're going to see all of those. We do get a handful of wells on Kauaʻi which maybe you're not going to see. I think that most of those are small residential wells, too. If they're not in compliance with the standards, we bring them to you, too. I guess the question is what's the breakdown of the ones that you don't see? If the question is what's the breakdown of...
A breakdown of all of the well permits.
I would say maybe 70% is little individual domestic wells. You get maybe about 10% of wells that might be for systems like Kāʻū Pūlehu. You are getting maybe about 10 or 15% and maybe more now that the Board is looking for alternative supplies of municipal wells and then another 10, 15, 20% of Navy monitor wells. I don't know if that added up to 100%.
If I can Chair, what we can do is we can get the specifics in writing. We have that data, we have WRIMS which is our Water Resource Information Management System and we can populate those reports, instead of these round numbers. I think the purpose of this presentation is very high-level focus on delegation, but if we can provide the specific permit amounts per island, types of uses we can do that analysis and provide that in writing in a future submittal.
As part of that recommendation.
Yeah, as part of the recommendation. What I think I'm going to ask and help facilitate this conversation is based on what's presented, what feels right, what doesn't feel right, what are thresholds that you want us to consider and bring for the recommendations, what are you comfortable with, what are you not comfortable with. Again, as Ryan has said and I will speak for myself in this process. I've come into this as an appointed deputy operating under the practice that has existed since 1997 and prior and so now that there's a desire to revisit and evaluate this process it would help us to understand what is it that you want us to focus on and then bring back to you folks recommendation. If you can gear your dialogue to that, that would help us frame the recommendation that we bring forward in a future submittal.
I have a comment and a question. I came onto this Commission on the sort of tail end of the Ota Well discussions and I saw some of the contention around that because it's my understanding that well construction permits don't necessarily require Ka Paʻakai analysis and I think that was what came up at the last meeting. Ryan or Deputy Manuel, can you confirm or explain is Ka Paʻakai analysis part of a well construction permit generally in or outside of a water management area? Because you referred to it as part of the case law, but I didn't see it as part of the regular process of a well construction permit.
Part of the reason why I presented that was because of the Chair's request and the comments that Ka Paʻakai, times are different from 1997 to today. What I will say is that yes, Ka Paʻakai is required in groundwater management areas and that's what I present to you when I present you well pumps and water use permits. Specifically for Ota Well it was required as that was part of the denial of the designation of Keauhou, was a requirement to make sure that that was addressed. I will say and I don't know if this is correct, but for wells that are in compliance with the standards and where we have assessed that a pump test shows no impacts then no, we don't require Ka Paʻakai analysis.
Let me just add on very clearly the Ka Paʻakai as we've discussed and as Chair made a priority in her coming into this agency is the kuleana of the applicant. The application does not ask the three questions or Ka Paʻakai analysis is not asked of the applicant currently on well construction permits. Very simplistically I think Ryan highlighted in our review process if there's areas via Kīpuka or even in staff review that we've known, there's been issues with practitioners or we know there's an existence of resources then we ask the applicant to go through that extra analysis. Again, that is discretionary and staff have used that judgment right now. Currently in the application there is no Ka Paʻakai that's required.
And it is my legal position. I believe Ka Paʻakai applies to everything so long as there is a potential impact. Now the analysis may vary depending upon the scope, but I do believe one still has to do the analysis and I do believe the burden is on the applicant. If the applicant does not provide us sufficient information I believe then it is our constitutional obligation to say we're going to deny your permit because you haven't given us sufficient information to do the analysis. But I also think government agencies have not been very clear with applicants on what those expectations are. I think we are trying as we move forward to make that very clear and I think Kaleo and his staff have done a very good job of elevating Ka Paʻakai. I think that's where I saw somewhat of an inconsistency on these well permits. Some places maybe it's a subdivision where we've got other Ka Paʻakai analysis. I think we should be able to look at some of those as well, but nonetheless I think we still have to do the analysis.
Thank you, Ryan for the analysis. The genesis for my question was one, are we consistent? Do we have a standard that we request of all well applicants? And two, is there an area if there are special conditions and where the proposed drilling takes place, not post-drilling but for review prior to the drilling? For example, in the Keauhou the issue was that aquifer may be under pressure so is the engineering and the process sufficient to handle any issues arising from something like that? I guess internally if it's addressed properly in the application maybe it should be handled within the department; however, I am very sympathetic to a very efficient and orderly processing of applications and it should not be extraordinarily cumbersome as long as we feel that we're protecting the aquifer. In today's conversation with the Navy they asked on the status of the three applications they have within your department. From my perspective, are we being most efficient, are we being most consistent, and are we ensuring that we're protecting the aquifer under some unusual situations. I know that you've articulated the 70% rule but are there any other special considerations that should be disclosed prior to drilling?
Can I build on that? I appreciate that point. In the commercial world we call it the customer discovery. How do people look upon this? Is it onerous? Is it impeding not only creating inefficiencies but impeding things that we want to have happen in our world that are good things: agricultural projects and sustainable food systems and so forth? What's broken about that that we can and should fix without compromising our mandates and obligations on our part for the resource?
I think since Kaleo has been here he's been very good about moving forward things where he feels like we need to be efficient and that we don't need to put like super deep scrutiny into. For example, I'm talking about the Hawaiian Paradise Park wells. They're such small capacity pumps. The sustainable yield is so high and you know Kaleo just kind of lets those things, how do I say this he allows us to be efficient in approving those things, whereas I think where things have a deeper cause for concern Kaleo goes back and forth with us. I don't know how he has the energy to do it and to put the scrutiny on every application, but Kaleo definitely does. Why are they using this much, what are they doing this, why are they identifying this water level? I do think that right now we are pretty efficient in the way that we get things out. Again, I am severely understaffed in Groundwater Regulation Branch, that's why you heard the Navy asking where are those three wells and we are understaffed and we haven't been getting things out as quick as we can which is why I'm kind of an advocate for efficiency while also recognizing that we do need to address the concerns that the Commission brings up and to bring focus into those things that you guys think are important which is why we're reaching out today so that we can get the best feedback from you to make a recommendation.
Just so I can speak for myself, thanks Ryan. Like I've said in most public settings and I'll tell everyone is I take every signature seriously, having had signed permits. I review every single permit that comes across my desk similarly. You kind of catch up and you learn about where the hot spots are throughout the state and where you spend your resources and time with the limited resources we have. The identification of HPP, what you do see is this huge influx of permits because people just want water security. This is a rural subdivision in the middle of Puna oftentimes below poverty level that are really just trying to make sure that they have water for their own uses. When you look at that as a public trust use of water within the context of available yield, all of these factors get factored into at least staff's analysis and our analysis. Getting to your point about what parts of the system do we really and where we should be focusing on, we really need, if we're going to get into even further analysis which I think is fair and which is within the context of our constitutional obligation we need more resources. Staff are not going to be able to process permits, bring it to this Commission, and also build capacity if Ka Paʻakai is going to be the questions that are added to the permit application. It will backlog the industry. The industry itself has been built up around a process that has been in existence since 1997, so if this is an additional requirement I will say it will backlog the industry and based on my review of current industry consultants and what they're producing related specifically to well construction permits. I will say we do need to revisit this with our attorney generals who have looked at often times this delegation of authority as almost a ministerial process versus a discretionary process and there's as a discretionary permit, there's additional triggers that happen. The instant requirement for 343. If everything is truly discretionary then everything triggers. Every permit, every use of water triggers 343. Right now that isn't the case for private wells on private property, at least that's the interpretation and analysis that staff have gone through. There are these implications as we go through this process and hearing Chair's concern about this dated delegation, I also share that we definitely want to revisit where it makes sense for us to manage our resources and also manage expectations on process because if including public participation, if we're going to provide even beyond the bulletin a venue for people to opine and comment on wells, it will prolong the process. It's just part of the reality of process and all of these things have push and pull points that this body obviously should consider in its decision making. I think we as staff, we're here to present what we're working with and what we have to deal with in a public, transparent process and then have real conversations about what are the next steps and what are the implications of those next steps.
I appreciate that. For me sitting both as Land Board and as chair of the CWRM, there's a heightened scrutiny upon us. There are competing interests, we have demand for housing and then we have watershed protection, we have traditional customary practices. I want to avoid, I want to minimize the risk for delays through litigation and contested case hearings and I'm all about process, an open process. I'm not necessarily advocating we're going to separate community meetings because I do not think that that is our kuleana as well, but I think the process through our CWRM Commission meetings provides a public platform for communities to be engaged either through informational meetings or through decision making. I do believe that we do need to have some criteria and I would just like the criteria to be vetted and that it's presented so we can get public comments. No we don't think you should be, that shouldn't be delegated or no, you should. To me, that's the cover that we need or that I need in particular as we're making decisions is that there's an opportunity for people to provide some input. At the end of the day we will proceed, but it is very difficult to manage competing needs, higher public expectation and I'm trying to find the path forward through both transparency but yet efficiency.
I wonder if there's a lesson learned from item B-2 on the agenda of training and maybe that's videotape so we don't have to invest the human capital in doing it all the time. Where people who are ready to apply go through some kind of, here's what we're looking for, here's what's going to happen so you can anticipate the questions in order to provide the information that'll make this most efficient. If we cue them to the answers to the test, then it'll help them expedite the process. We don’t have to put it all on us.
We need to provide them the tools, but I think it's also if an application is not complete then it is not an application in our process. I think we get criticized including the State Historic Preservation division for sitting on things too long, but I think it's because what's coming to us isn't complete. We have to have the courage to say, “you know what, this is not a complete application. These are the things that are expected and you haven't included the Ka Paʻakai analysis, therefore it's not complete. Please do this and then come back when you're...”
I would have big problems if everybody had to meet the Ka Paʻakai analysis. There is a provision in the code about de minimis effect and so we should look at that as one way of avoiding having every little household do a Ka Paʻakai because if you do the Ka Paʻakai, that standard says ‘we don't know’ is not an answer.
In my mind it's a constitutional obligation beyond the code, so even if the code may have a separate standard. Again I also don't think if there are numerous houses in the same subdivision that are looking for a permit, there's no reason we cannot rely upon other similarly situated information, historic information, moʻolelo, streams that go through there, other kinds should be similar. I think that there are other ways to address that. CWRM can make our applications public. If you’ve got a well that you want to do, permit right next to this house, look at the application that's already been submitted. I don't think it has to be onerous, I think people think it's onerous, but I don't think it has to be as onerous as a perception.
I think it’s onerous.
I have a thought and since I'm in a public hearing I just want to put it out there. It's probably a 10-year data compilation project for somebody but to be able to have a map and to say ‘I want to put a well in this location. Whoa, there's some interesting, confined aquifers,’ and suddenly it triggers. Okay, if you're in this region because it has this geology, here are the things you're going to need to do. Sorry, this is not more work for you, Ryan without five more people but maybe somebody in the audience will take this idea and run with it. I think we all want to know what documents, what historic reports for a certain area you people should be referencing. If it is Kepa Manley’s report, here. We don't want to have to nag an applicant and it should be easy for them to piggy-back on the work that's already done. I have a thought going back to the main objective about delegation. It makes sense for me to not have staff, Deputy, Chair shoulder the responsibility for certain items that may be high risk or need to be in a public form. I don't know what those criteria are but between now and when this becomes an action item, I think this is a good start, wells in management area aquifers where conditions are established by the Commission. Being more specific about those regions maybe on a shape file, unusual hydrogeology, because that's going to apply to where wells have evidence of impacts to streams and then that's the same with it doesn't matter if it's maximum pump capacity or confined aquifer that's going to leak. We have to think about, again, the potential impacts due to human variables of construction and also the environmental variables and historical variables because some areas are going to be more sensitive to others or have more active practice. I think we can sit down with some maps and try and get some teeth around that.
Can I respond to your two points because I think they're spot on. The conversation about this map has been, at least since I've started in this water industry, has been the talk of the town. Everybody's wanting the cheat sheet to get to the finish line. The challenge is and what the constitutional courts have said consistently is T&C are very specific and site based and practice based, so when you start to create these kinds of maps that articulate, “oh this is what happens in certain areas,” it meets portions of the constitutional obligation in some context but it's not the end all be all. It creates this cheat sheet that oftentimes people feel like it's the bar that needs to be set but the challenge is the bar is a lot higher, at least that's what the courts have said. It's very specific and there are also concerns about sharing a lot of that data and information with certain practices in certain communities which was the case in the Ota well when we went or at least when I went out and discussed stuff with community. That's a challenge staff have articulated that it shouldn't necessarily, consistent with Commissioner Miike, be if you're an individual just trying to get a well and having to go through this additional analysis. People don't know where to go, they don't know, what do you mean Ka Paʻakai? Then they have to understand what Ka Paʻakai means and their constitutional obligation as citizens in the state of Hawaii. A lot of people don't get that and so there is this capacity that we're talking about that to be honest doesn't exist except within very small circles within the state and it's a huge ramp up that we're going to have to work towards. I'm not saying that it's not required and something we shouldn't be doing but it's just part of the reality when you ask people Ka Paʻakai, they have no clue. It is something that we need to do. I do want to get a feel for the group, what I'm hearing is adding Ka Paʻakai to the application. If that is something that we're going to recommend, then we need to modify applications and set that expectation from the beginning. That's a huge shift from the current practice and so we'll obviously check with AG's and work with Chair but the feeling from the body is we need guidance. If that is something that you, this body, believes is a requirement to put in a well and a pump, that's something we can pursue and we're open to that dialogue but that's currently not what we're doing and we really need guidance from you folks on this if this is something you want to do because I think that'll set the tone and the shift in the current practice.
Can I clarify that's not necessarily what I mean but there should be a flag if you're going to work in a certain area to do more and it doesn't need to require disclosure of sensitive information, but there should be a flag to say look closer.
SHPD, they have but it is TMK specific. You could go to...I know that Leo Asuncion was working on, OPSD, so there would be different layers of different kinds of whether it would be different kinds of sensitivities or zoning. I think there was an attempt and quite frankly that was the one of the purposes of the ʻAha Moku Council, was to design sort of this overlay not necessarily of specific practices but to say ʻohan from here, if you're going to do anything here you should talk to these people or there would be sort of bubbles of sensitive area, talk to community. It was not in some way to reveal confidential, ʻohana secrets but at least put people on awareness. Because true, if we're going to require this we better give people the tools, the access where to get it. There's a lot of people who have good intentions but they just don't know where. There's a transition period that we have to go through, we cannot start from tomorrow, everybody got to do this. But I think we do have to start elevating what the expectations are and get guidance.
This is a pretty large issue, way beyond the duties of CWRM, but I guess the general disposition I have is not to lower the bar but to really as you said, raise the bar and give people resources so they can achieve that. It occurs to me that as those applications come in, we will become the repository for some really valuable information and making that an accessible repository with guardrails. Like Papakilo database, you can go do your genealogy there, you don't have to give it to them. They help you do it and then you make the decision whether you want to disclose. I think we should always honor that kind of choice and control and so forth but to the extent people wish to share, then we start to create rather than have all this wonderful information sit in the file of well permits. Let's bring it into an accessible database that then helps other people with their future well permits.
I'd have to go back and look at Ka Paʻakai again but I I'm not sure it applies to each and every situation. It seems to me that it cannot apply to absolutely everything we do. It's an impossible burden to overcome.
You're right, no you're right. It is case by case, but I think we have to at least embark on that analysis. I think just to develop criteria saying, okay these things it won't apply to something as very small as if it could be a well permit that happens to go right next to this stream or this trail. That small well may make a difference, so I think that I always think in my mind whenever I'm looking at a project, is there a stream that passes by? Are there trails? Are there native plants? There may be certain kinds of triggers that one may think are a minimal impact, but I agree it is case by case.
Your example, I'm at a loss to see how your ordinary person can overcome that burden by saying there is no impact. Maybe I don't know who can do that, I doubt whether CWRM can do that. I guess one of the issues for the Attorney General is does Ka Paʻakai apply to absolutely everything we do or are there others? It’s a very heavy burden for an applicant to have to meet that.
But it's mitigation. You could have an adverse impact but you have reasonable mitigation. It may be monetary, it may be creating a buffer. I think Ka Paʻakai does require some analysis to determine if there's an adverse impact or potential. What are reasonable mitigation measures? To me that's all that the court is asking us.
But the court is asking that you show positively that there is no impact or if there is an impact, what are you going to do about it? That's why I think it's an insurmountable burden to a small person just wanting to put something towards their own homestead.
Fair enough, fair enough.
Maybe because there's public here and it's almost 6, if you want to do testimony and then we can continue the conversation.
Three parts in three minutes. Slide number 10: I want to just bring to your attention I thought that was really great that CWRM staff held public hearings. Just to reiterate public hearing community input is important. I do have an issue as you all mentioned during the course of this conversation with community outreach being that only through subscription to bulletin is community able to know what's going on with these well permits. I just want to reiterate that and then maybe listen to your conversation, categories how you said individuals versus ʻohana and also / is on Homestead / is it business or commercial for-profit. Case in point that the question mentioned about 5-million-gallon request and then the response about usually it's in small capacity; however, I want to reiterate it was said that Mahi Pono applied for permit or permits that went and go beyond the sustainable yields. Yes, it is important to be very vigilant about that and to summarize the second part with and reemphasize slides 30 and 31. 30 is the Ka Paʻakai slides. 30 and 31 with the Ka Paʻakai and 31 and regarding Waiāhole and the public trust. I thought that was really important to reemphasize and then slide 32 Molokaʻi about the precautionary principle. The three points on page 32 was really important to really reemphasize that. Actually it's on page 33 that again not affecting kanaka maoli rights and just to err on the side of precaution without the need to prove scientifically. Again reiterate slide 32 and just to end with this, that I do hope that CWRM does listen as you're saying right before I testified and make decisions from public community input rather than just coming with preconceived personal decisions already to make within the board. On the previous one I testified and then you're kind of ready just to pass it so I really do hope that this process is based off of again the public input that you may hear that day and then also decide to whether defer or postpone and again to really listen to the public. Public input is really important and that ending with public trust purposes having priority over private commercial uses, this being for water, ʻāina and everything. I just wanted to bring that to reemphasize those points again.
For the record my name is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer. I'm here on behalf of the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. You have our written testimony, I'd like to expand a little bit upon it and also just draw some points that have arisen in the discussion. First of all I really want to thank you, Chair Chang for bringing this. This is actually one of the most important issues you've brought in front of this Commission or has been in front of this Commission for many years and I really thought it was an excellent presentation by Ryan. This has been something that has been a long-standing issue for the Commission particularly because there's been a mismatch between, as the Waiāhole case, one of the quotes Ryan didn't bring up that your responsibility to protect public trust issues applies to old waters without exception or distinction. It's not just in designated areas that you have a kuleana, but you've only had a real tool because of this delegation of authority to protect public trust interests in water and public trust uses of water in designated water management areas because of this delegation. The presentation was excellent again particularly including the administrative history. Some of those decisions are not online and so it's actually been years of trying to find out when was this delegated, what exactly was delegated. It's really good and this is something that I and others for DHHL and for others have asked about and commented on for many years. I want to now move on to expand on to the discussion of delegation and how the public is informed that you raised Chair Chang because that was typically the answer that when we ask we said, well how do we find out about this? The response is, okay well it's in the bulletin. I read the bulletin every month, I'm probably one of the few people who do. But I just want to highlight for you some of the characteristics of the bulletin. It's not entirely clear in the section in the bulletin on well construction and pump installation permits, what's included and what's not. There are things in there that have been in there literally for decades and there's other things that if they appear at all, appear very limited. The way the bulletin is presented you can't actually download the data easily and put into a spreadsheet so you have to manually go through. I just want to highlight for you one particular thing about public notice, presumably the 90-day approval deadline when it appears in the bulletin and then there's 90 days, that's presumably the public’s chance to comment. I printed out this month's bulletin and if you can see the yellow highlighting, you don't have approval dates on everyone but there were 30 instances in which the approval for the wells were issued prior to the 90-day deadline occurring. Before the comment period ended the wells were approved. There's actually one well in the Kahului aquifer by King's Cathedral where it's listed and maybe it's an error in the bulletin, but the application was approved before the application was filed.
I'm sure that was a mistake.
There's a number in which the letter of assurance appeared before the application was filed, so I'm not sure that it's necessarily a mistake. Just to highlight that this isn't just unusual necessarily to this bulletin. When I was before you not speaking on behalf of DHHL at your September meeting but with concerns about the Hāpuna aquifer, I referenced the Kaloko deep monitoring well on Hinalani Street. Now this was a well in which the Water Commission was the applicant as well as the approving entity for the well construction and pump installation permit and if you recall that well was specifically designed to try and discover deep confined groundwater below salt water. It did so but it's pierced that aquifer boundary and for months now it's not been sealed and that water has been wasted, gushing out of that well. In that particular case the well construction and pump installation permit for that particular well appeared in the bulletin only after the application was accepted as complete. A letter of assurance was issued to the driller, the 90-day common period expired, and the permit was already approved and it just appeared once in the bulletin. There was no chance at all for the public to comment on how that is and I don't believe that's unique to this. Public notice under the existing scheme is significantly lacking. This also is significant when you relate in terms of public trust uses and there was some discussion of the use of public pump tests in how we might evaluate the impact on a stream or on an ankle line pool or a nearshore ecosystem. Pump tests under the existing rules go somewhere between three and I think at the longest five days. Let me just be really clear, that's not going to be sufficient in the vast majority of cases to identify any hydrological impact on a public trust resource. It will happen, it might happen over months or years but when you draw water out of the ground it's not for free. Eventually that water that you're taking out of the ground is not flowing to the coast or not flowing to a stream or not flowing to some groundwater dependent ecosystem. The pump tests are designed to see whether or not that particular well can sustain that level of pumping and they do that well but they are not designed nor do they run in a way that can identify impacts to public trust uses. The other important thing and we talk about well, is the pumping near sustainable yield. The impact on a particular public trust use whether it is a limu bed or a fish pond or a stream resource, actually an individual wells impact on that public trust use of water will have nothing to do with whether or not you're at near sustainable yield. You could have a sustainable yield of hundreds of millions of gallons a day, but if you put in a big well right next to the resource you're trying to protect, it will be impacted. Conversely you could have a very small sustainable yield and you could be pumping over sustainable yield, but if it's very, very far away from that resource that you're trying to protect the impacts that you'll see will be minuscule to none over any meaningful time period. Impacts happen to these resources based on the location of the well, the depth of the well, and the pumping level but not at all in relationship to what the sustainable yield is of the aquifer. The consequences of all this for DHHL’s beneficiaries one, is that there's some significant inequity. For our beneficiaries and others, if you happen to live in a designated area you get to find out who's pumping in your area and a meaningful chance to comment and see whether or not your rights as a DHHL beneficiary to a public trust use of water are impacted. If you're not under the existing scheme you're completely disadvantaged even if you manage to catch in the bulletin and you manage to send your comments in prior to the approval. There's no obligation under the existing practice for the Commission to even respond and there is certainly no due process available to DHHL or the beneficiaries in practice. I'll just also highlight for you this desire to be able to meaningfully comment and change and challenge particular land uses is what has driven designation processes around the state because it's been the only way that people can be involved. For these reasons again, really grateful for you bringing this up. It is a really critical and important issue for the management of water. It helps you solve some of the issues you have in terms of your mismatch between what your kuleana, responsibilities are versus the rights you have to implement it and DHHL is particularly and its beneficiaries are particularly impacted because we have reservations around the state that outside of designated management areas, people are impacting them but our ability to protect our reservation rights are very limited. I'd be more than happy to answer any questions. Mahalo nui.
I just want to join. Thank you, Jonathan. You know this is coming back to us so if you or Tara have any concrete ideas that you want to suggest to Kaleo and the team here, we are going to review our policies and practices. I think they'd be most welcome.
Most immediately I would suggest, Commissioner Hannahs for wells that are for domestic uses that are in line with the county's level of proposed domestic guidelines, so between 400 and 600 gallons per day would seem to me to be, with a very few exceptions are you’re next to a fish pond or something like that. You could reasonably exempt and say that there's not...
The de minimis rule.
But just to keep in mind people file well construction permits and they call them domestic uses but they are for pools and extensive landscaping. I think you would need to tie it not just to, they're saying it's a domestic use but is it actually in- house domestic uses? The intent behind the court's protection of domestic uses.
The public notification, hearing the concern we've been working internally with staff and on our admin rules for example, on maybe strategies to address the concern about not being notified or not knowing if a well permit comes in. I think one of the draft rules that we're looking at is a well goes in that you're required to notify your adjacent land owners, just TMK adjacent, just be a good neighbor as part of the notification requirement so your neighbor would know, hey if you're putting in a well and I have a well at least I have a chance to determine whether it's impacting me. Or if I have T&C on my property, I want to know if it's going to actually dry up my loʻi or something like that. Those are other strategies that we're looking at pursuing through rulemaking to address some of the concerns about public notice. Hearing the concerns, we can also strategize and think of other ways to be more transparent and provide public opportunity. Just a question for the body right now, there's this transition period and context, currently there's delegation to chair to approve permits and there's quite a backlog of permits that are sitting on our desk right now for review and approval. I hear the urgency to bring something back or we are going to feel the pressure and get phone calls, Ryan and the team, where's my permit? Where's my permit? You heard a couple of them and seen some testimony today, so we can commit to try to bring some recommendations back on a revisit of the delegation as soon as possible but in the meantime that's still a month from today. I'm just curious...
What I'd like to do is work together with me and then we can develop this...
Strategy. DEPUTY MANUEL: On how to address it?
Simple, we as a commission will delegate to you and give you the authority to delegate to them.
No action at this time but that could be a future action Commissioner Miike, that could be a future action.
