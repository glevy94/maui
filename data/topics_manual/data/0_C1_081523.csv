Introduction to the U.S. Geological Survey Hydrologic Network in the Pacific Islands by Dr. Chris Curran, United States Geological Survey (USGS)
Dr. Strauch of the CWRM Stream Protection and Management Branch introduced Dr. Chris Curran, with the USGS Pacific Islands Water Science Center, Assistant Center Director for Hydrologic Data. Dr. Curran gave a presentation on the USGS cooperative agreement and USGS activities related to water in Hawai‘i. He highlighted the hydrologic monitoring network and stream gaging operations including how data are collected, processed, reviewed for quality assurance, and delivered to the public.
Thank you very much Dr. Curran. Quick question, for FY 24 what is the number of gaging stations you are planning to install?
For FY 24, that’s a fair question. We have two gages that we still have to install this year. And I can tell you we have, our FY 24 agreement includes 46 stream gages. We have 17 rain gages. We have 5 wells. In terms of installations, I don’t think we have...Ayron do you have that off the top of your head? I’m not sure. I know that we have been working with Ayron and Deputy Director Manuel to try to pass on some of the cost share and responsibilities to other agencies. I think we’ve been successful. This coming fiscal year we have the Kaua‘i Department of Water on board for some installations, so those are going to be new installations, but they were assisted with the help of communication from CWRM.
So, the number of, go ahead Ayron. I’m sorry.
Let’s not get into item B-1 yet, but are you interested in the network that’s growing statewide that’s beyond just CWRM-funded?
Absolutely. And I guess what I’m trying to understand, is the number of stations a function of how many other co-funding agencies there are, as opposed to something USGS undertakes on its own?
I can get into that.
Ok. Can I ask one more editorial comment from Chris? Recently there was a three-state agreement on how to share water in the Colorado River. Can you sort of provide an overview on what data was used to determine that?
For the Colorado River?
Yes. There is an agreement I think California I believe, Arizona, and Nevada.
Yeah. That entire system has been contentious for decades. You know there was a lot of, it’s the result of many years of litigation. I have to say I’m not intimately familiar with it. I don’t want to over speak, but I can guarantee you that water data collected by the USGS was a foundational piece of that agreement because as a neutral party, rather than for example, the California State Water Authority managing things, USGS is a neutral party, it’s recognized as a neutral party. And so, we have a pretty extensive stream gaging network throughout California and up into Lake Meade area. And I know that data was and is being used heavily to monitor streamflow in the Colorado River. I’m sorry I can’t provide you with more information, I’m just not super familiar or I don’t have the latest information on that. But I could direct you to our California Water Science Center or we could get information from them if you had more questions.
I was looking more at the framework like a model going forward to resolve water issues. That’s a huge water issue.
And you know I mean again USGS is just not a regulatory agency. So, our mission is to collect the science and collect the data and we don’t get involved in deciding how much water people get or even how it’s managed. We would provide technical advice on the data. And we would develop models for helping understand the natural system and we would share that information, but that’s the limit of what we can do and be engaged in.
Ok. Thank you, Chris.
Any other questions? Commissioners? Oh yes, Aurora.
Thank you, Chris Curran. I have a question. The USGS Water Science Center does a really good job at measuring stage and discharge. You mentioned briefly that water quality is also measured and I think that is becoming increasingly important with climate change considering changes to temperature that also give us insights into what is happening with or other geochemical tracers. So, what is the USGS doing to incorporate that kind of newer understanding, of understanding how flow and the other variables that might be of interest to managers? Or is there, this is not a co- op agreement, but you know what is the Water Science Center doing to think forward?
Yeah. So, in the Pacific Islands Water Science Center, the water quality work is being done in our studies section so that was the green, back to that org chart, that was on the green side. For the most part, a lot of the water quality work that’s currently being done is looking at turbidity of streams, looking at doing sampling, doing discrete sampling for water quality parameters. I think that if you’re looking for concentrations, it’s important and trying to understand the flux, the movement of things like contaminants, it’s important to know how much water is in the channel. So, for the most part, our stream gaging network is sort of the foundation for a lot of water quality work, especially continuous water quality monitoring. The gaging stations can be outfitted with sensors that measure water quality parameters continuously. So that’s currently what we’re doing now here on O‘ahu and at several sites. And once that’s set up, then we have staff that go out and do sampling as opposed to measuring stream flow. Their role is strictly water quality sampling. I don’t know if I answered your question.
Yes, Chris thank you for your presentation. You began with a discernable sense of pride that we’ve been in partnership gathering this data at least back to 1917, so over 100 years. So, what is the value of having that historic record?
Well, I think that we know that the climate is changing and the older record, first of all, the older record is really invaluable for helping us understand the baseline. How the baseline describes what the conditions were 100 years ago. From that baseline then we’re able to assess things like long-term change in flows or even water quality in some cases depending on the length of those data sets. So, we can always go out and collect more stream flow today, but we cannot go back in time and make measurements. So really the older information is very important. Especially in watersheds that maybe have less anthropomorphic effects, more natural conditions. Those older gages like Hālawa Stream, very important for understanding how quickly things are changing.
So, I take it it makes sense if you could lengthen that longitudinal record you would. And I wonder if your data collection capabilities include accessing for instance, old sugar plantation records who were really good record keepers about water as well as in pre-contact times, the records of the observations of Hawaiian ancestors who were keen observers, analyzers, and recorders. But their method of recording data was just different. It was in chant and it was in story that had to be decoded. Does that capacity exist within your agency? Or have you considered partnering with local organizations to kind of help you extend that record?
Yeah, that’s an interesting thought. I know that there are more models coming out that simply are using the question of whether there is or isn’t water in a stream. Especially the ephemeral streams and that kind of information certainly would probably exist during the timeframes you’re talking about, pre-European arrival and timeframe. I don’t know of any, and that’s not to say that it’s not being done. I don’t know, I’m just not familiar with any current projects that are being done to link those older and more recent data sets. It’s certainly a fascinating idea and I think it’s worthy of more exploration and discussion for sure.
I think Ayron Strauch is pretty aware of those sets and who’s kind of a local partner to partner with on that. We’ll leave that to you folks to consider.
Chris can I follow up with Commissioner Hannah’s question? So based upon this baseline, can you summarize briefly some of the trends that you’re seeing over the 100-year period of time, the data that you’ve been collecting? Just high level.
I’m not ready to do that on my own yet. Ayron is actually looking at the data much more than I’ve had a chance to. Full disclosure, I’ve been here two years and it was a big challenge just kind of learning where I’m at, learning what I know now. So, I’m continuing to learn, but actually trying to understand some of the trends. What streams are, where flow is decreasing over time. Ayron’s given talks and he’s got a better idea of this than I do.
Fair enough. We have our own in-house expert.
If I can add on that. There is a USGS report related to 2016 looking at trends and low flows.
There were a couple fact sheets and Delwyn Oki did a report back in 2004, I think it was, and then Bassiouni and Oki published a report that looked at data from 1913- 2008. Chui Chang did a good assessment report for all water data in Pacific Island’s Water Science Center. I think that was 2016. So, we have reports that are published and available.
Very good, thank you. Other questions Commissioners? Oh, there’s Paul. Go ahead.
Thank you very much, Chris. Thank you for your presentation and for your work. They’re greatly appreciated. As you know it’s vital to anyone concerned with water in Hawai‘i. Really appreciate it. I’m glad you mentioned Ayron’s name. Ayron if I might, do you have any observations or comments based on the presentation this morning?
Just that it is as previously mentioned, the length of record is really key. And thank you to the Commission who has supported re-establishment of some discontinued stations across the State. I believe at least 4 that I can name off the top of my head, have records for anywhere from 40-80 years before they were discontinued. And then in the last 5 years we’ve been able to reestablish them. So, getting that data collection back on track to be able to monitor those trends over time is really key. And just high level observations, low flows are declining. We’ve also seen in the last 6 years, a number of significant flood events. Very unusual to have that number across the State in a short time period. Take it as you will.
Thank you, gentlemen. Chris again, thank you very much. Your work really is vital to us. Appreciate you.
Thank you.
Thank you Paul. Ayron, are you noticing dip trends on water quality based upon the different kind of uses? Agricultural uses from plantation days to something more diversified now?
Unrelated to Commission work, prior to this position I held a research position at UH and one of the things I studied was impacts of land use change on water quality. And if you transition from forest conditions to more diversified agriculture, you get increased runoff and with that, sediment loads. And with that sediment loads, nutrients, and that sort of thing. Yes, with changing land cover, previous USGS scientists have also studied this, have also documented how in degraded environments, for example, you get heavier loads of different chemicals. So, I don’t think that’s anything groundbreaking.
Ok. Only reaffirms sort of anecdotally what was. Very good. Any other questions Commissioners?
I just wanted to highlight the water alerts are very cool and I wasn’t aware of that. I think they will be a very good tool for people especially given USGS gold standards in terms of flood awareness. Usually, I’m just refreshing the website during a hurricane for instance. For folks who are getting flooded out that they can set the lows and highs. I’m glad this is recorded and public and people should shout it from the rooftops and make it work for them. I appreciate you highlighting that.
Chair Chang thanks Dr. Curran for his presentation. Deputy Manuel acknowledges that there are no individuals on Zoom or in the boardroom waiting to testify on this item.
