CWRM Budget and Legislative Updates
Chair, Commissioners, as well as community, we wanted to take this opportunity in the beginning of the Legislature to highlight where we’re at in the budget and some of the bills, at least the Administrative Bill that’s been introduced as of yesterday and some of the things that we may see or might not see coming out. I don’t think we’ve done this before with the Commission, but I think it’s timely and hopefully we can do this more often, keep you updated as our decision-making body. We’re known as LNR 404 in the DLNR budget, so you see that in budget worksheets, it’s very budget oriented, tons of spreadsheets in excel - that is our budget number. In general, here’s our base budget we’ve talked a lot about lack of resources or need for more resources and this is a quick summary from my very simplistic view as an administrator. We have 27 positions within the Water Commission, four of those were added in during my last tenure, prior to that we’ve been short. Since 1987 it’s been around this much between the teens and the twenties. These are 27 positions juxtaposed against the 1,084 positions of the overall DLNR budget. When you talk about balance and need for resources, 27 out of 1,084 for water is really telling and that is the picture I try to paint for most people. Twenty-two of those are general funded, 5 are special funded out of the state land development fund, those are revenues generated from leases developed by Land Division before the Board. Our FY 23 operating budget was a little over $4 million that includes almost $3 million in GF. We have a ceiling of $356,474 from our water resource management special fund and a ceiling of $812,768 from what we call our SPAM Special Fund. This funds 5 positions but also has about $110,000 that comes from the SLD fund for steam studies. It primarily pays for staff travel, the team that you see here doing our stream monitoring measuring, etc. as well as pay for some of our stream gages. The other general funds that are used, almost $2 million goes to staff personnel cost right now, about $1 million goes to the USGS gaging contract, so we have maybe less than half a million of discretionary funding for our general operations. That’s just the world we have to work within. We talk about resources, managing resources, so those are some of the challenges we work on.
Are all the positions funded positions?
Great question. No, the four Aquatic Biologist positions in SPAM Branch that make up the 27, those four were created in 2019, taken away during the pandemic and just got put back in last session. We are working on establishing those. We have one vacancy in Groundwater Branch that we are trying to fill. On February 1, we’ll just have those four Aquatic Biologists positions and the 1 groundwater position that’s vacant, so we’ll have 22 filled positions.
Where do fines go?
Fines will go into the Water Resource Management Fund, under 174C 5.5, that articulates what that fund can be used for. In general, I’ve advocated for $2 million annually in the CIP budget for deep monitoring well development. It costs about that much to do one deep monitoring well and we’ve been successful in upping that to a yearly request. Prior administrations or strategies have been to ask every supplemental year, so every other year, but in our USGS monitoring program, our proposed build out, it’s going to take 100 years if we just do one every two years. We really need to ramp this up and ask for more development funds if we want to get a better understanding especially of our groundwater resource and aquifers in the face of climate change. Next, I’m going to talk about what’s in the budget now. The four Aquatic Biologist positions were reestablished but whenever you reestablish start positions you only get half the year funding. This year we are asking for full year funding which is identified there for those four Aquatic Biologist positions. We are working with our HR office to determine whether that classification is appropriate or not and we may be shifting to some other classification like general professionals that gives us more flexibility to meet the needs of our staff and the work we need to do. The CIP appropriation for deep monitoring wells, those are the two funding budgets that were approved that made it into the Ige Administration budget. Legislation Senate Bill 1386 was just introduced yesterday but that was an administrative bill that we put in and this is relating to declaring water shortages and emergencies. Dealing with this Red Hill disaster and issue, one of the things, working with the Attorney General’s office, is that the bill declaring emergencies was tied to the shortage and shortage planning as articulated in the Code, so what we are recommending is to split it out to say that if there is an emergency that the Commission has the explicit authority to declare an emergency. There’s language and amendments to the Code to give the Commission that authority to deal with situations like this, hoping that we don’t ever have to use it and that we can anticipate shortage with better data and planning and proactive research, but if we didn’t use that, we’d have that tool available to us and that was in response to this Red Hill situation. Next is a graphic of DLNR’s overall CIP budget. The greenish color is the $2 million in CIP for deep monitoring well development. Last year we got a lump fund appropriation from the Legislature and as part of the kuleana of the Chair is to prioritize all the CIP projects throughout the agency. Fortunately, Water Commission has been able to stay on top of that table and get part of that lump sum of the portion of the $20,000,000. I just wanted to show graphically some of the things that are also being balanced within the overall agency. Lastly, the Green Administration had asked us for potential budget modifications or requested budget items. We added some but some of these were part of our original Ige Administration ask but weren’t in the Governor’s budget. We submitted a request to add seven new positions to Groundwater Branch and Survey Branch and that’s really to ramp up and meet the needs of some of our groundwater work and our water use permit approvals and reviews dealing with the Red Hill issue, etc. I framed this under a climate crisis research and monitoring but it’s important that we start to put monies towards this. We’ve asked for additional funding to add more stream gages to our system. USGS can only handle about five gages a year so we’re asking for five every year and the idea is just to keep asking for that every single year. It’s still not going to get us to build-out for another couple decades but we’re hoping that we can beef that up and partner with USGS and working with our Congressional Delegation to increase the federal resources in that program as well. Limu research we’ve been working with Water Resource Research Center, University of Hawai‘i, DAR and KUA to build off the year of limu and actually look at how groundwater dependent ecosystems and the research that they’ve done in Keauhou on limu. We can start to partner with them because that is the next thing we have to understand is how groundwater affects nearshore ecosystems and the nearshore environments as another public trust use of water and just to support our work with Water Resource Research Center funding to help with the management of the Hawai‘i Mesonet program through the Hawai‘i climate data portal. To shorten that timeframe of 100 years, if we develop a deep monitor well every year or every other year, we need to do more and we’re wanting to increase that $5 to $10 million but we’re also looking at federal funding resources to hopefully supplement or double down on our state budget that we do get allocated here. That’s generally our budget - omit the increase of $5 million a year that didn’t make it into the CIP. Sorry, that was a typo that didn’t get changed.
We are trying to be optimistic with Governor Green’s commitment to climate change. To utilize that we need to be prepared from the Water Commission side to address Commissioner Katayama’s question about being proactive. What can we do in light of climate change? I think we need to be situated to take advantage of federal funds as well as the Governor’s commitment to climate change. I do want to use our public Water Commission meeting also as a public forum as appropriate legislation arises to bring that to the Commission’s attention as well as the public’s attention so that we create a forum for public to provide us testimony or comments on proposed legislation.
I know this is constrained with the practicality of the budget but two questions – one, where in your positions is there a point person to interface with DOH as we have joint responsibilities and two, are there positions that do not yet exist in divisions, that may not exist, that would be ideal to have, just so we keep in mind the ideal capacity of CWRM versus the current?
We haven’t dreamt yet about what the ideal CWRM full build-out would look  like. You’re quickly reminded in government - that’s too big and too much. I hear what you’re saying and one of the things in the next four years I’m committed to, is helping to support staff to build their capacity and get more bodies in and part of that is growing smartly in a smart way. When you throw massive lumps of money and resources, the training, the onboarding, that change in culture is a shock. What I’ve been proposing with staff is these realistic requests for staffing and budget so we can grow smart and help to build that capacity over time. What you’re seeing, is talking with staff, where we believe we need to focus right now to meet current needs, but also will help to build capacity in the long term. That’s my short answer. With DOH, the groundwater team does interface regularly with DOH, especially on their safe drinking water side. Planning also takes a large role with coordinating with DOH. One of the things Kathy and I have talked about as Deputies in this next round, and thanks for confirming me, is to really tighten up our DOH and CWRM staff collaboration, our processing, and to really understand who is on first and in certain situations tighten up that relationship. Looking at funding opportunities, they have the revolving loan funds - whether those resources could be used and leveraged with CWRM’s limited resources to align projects or move together in certain ways. It’s a long-winded answer, but I think there’s enough momentum to better align the limited resource we do have with the leadership that’s in place. Kathy and I are continuing from the last administration so I think we can hit the ground running, unlike other departments that really have to build that momentum up. I’m hopeful, not putting Kathy on the spot, but I think we can do good things together and keep up the momentum that we’ve created.
I appreciate the question, too. I think this administration as well as our own internal is really committed to better internal coordination. We need to be in sync - there’s really no reason because it all goes back to the public trust. When we aren’t in sync it leads to public mistrust. I think this administration is really emphasizing the need for greater coordination internally both within your own agency and externally with your sister agencies before we go out to the public. There’s a real desire to do that. Also, with respect to DLNR we have been living quite frankly over the last decade, hand to mouth, but there’s going to be a great infusion of both federal funds and this administration, as well as the Legislature’s commitment to climate change, for us to be in the lead of that. Like Kaleo said, we need to think big, and we need to start planning. We need to look at strategic planning, over the next 10, 20 years so all this emphasis on being more proactive, there is going to be a change of a mindset internally at DLNR. Many of our divisions are generating revenue that they have not done before so we are looking at more strategically at the future. We ask for your patience but there is a desire to be much more efficient and effective with our resources so that we can do better for the general public.
Chair, getting to the full build-out, what resources and staff would be appropriate. The framework update to the Hawai‘i Water Plan, it is a tool and a mechanism, and putting that out there as a fellow planner, to really take that long-term perspective and build-out to that. I think once that framework update is completed and approved by this body, we are going to set the tone and vision for the next 20, 30, 40, 50 years. Then we’ll be able to figure out and determine what are the resources we need to accomplish those overall long-term plan goals. That framework is looking at climate change, place-based management and elevating traditional and ecological knowledge and practice of native Hawaiians, that holistic world view on water resource management. Once that framework is solid, and this body adopts it, then we can start to build-out that team to accomplish those large goals and visions.
This is me switching to my UH hat. I just want to put it out here while DOH and CWRM are in the same room. The University and especially some departments are undergoing a big turnover and there’s going to be a lot of hires in the next several years because people have retired during the pandemic and there will be new openings. I think it would a great opportunity to make sure the UH is engaged - Water Resource Research Center is also rebuilding and to think about that. I’m also part of a scoping effort to think about what are the pathways we need to place people in water professions and it’s not just in engineering. To the extent possible, please don’t forget UH is part of your resource team.
We’ve already engaged President Lassner about having more internships, having greater pathways, so that you get trained here within DLNR and when positions become available, there’s a nice smooth transition. There’s no reason why government should not be looking upon itself to provide a lot of these resources so we can keep our local kids here. We are committed just as you are to both the University as well community colleges and even high schools, to start them on this pathway towards this conservation, preservation, movement so thank you for that.
Just so you know, DOH is also looking at work force development so please send people our way as well.
We’re all tapping into the same people. Kaleo, do we have the meeting schedule for the next two meetings?
The next two meetings are there on the agenda and we will be coordinating, with your guidance, on some of the follow-up on what you wanted to hear and see. Thank you so much for the flexibility on shifting to the last Tuesday for today’s meeting.
I appreciate that, we’ve been kind of jamming on a lot of things, but we did want to have a meeting this month, so I appreciate everybody making it and this concludes our meeting. Mahalo, mahalo, mahalo. A hui hou.
