COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Uh-huh.

GENERAL HASHIMOTO: All of these three inputs are being fed back into D.C. Okay?

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Okay.

GENERAL HASHIMOTO: D.C. will be consolidating -- folks in D.C. will be consolidating this report later this year. They're working on criteria on how they're gonna approach that right now. I'm not involved in that at this point in time, but that's what they're gonna be doing to make the recommendations to the final brief to Congress in February '24.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Is there -- and is the cri part of that process in D.C., or can it be? And I'm just asking because in, like, planning and participatory theory, there's rungs of engagement.

GENERAL HASHIMOTO: Yeah.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: And consultation is sort of the lowest, and then, like, community decision-making is the highest, and the reality is it's gonna be somewhere in between. So is there -- you know, in this -- and it's really important for building trust to have more than that. So are you sort of engaging with those ideas of maybe shifting in order to build trust in the level of sort of community, say in at least that shortlisting?
