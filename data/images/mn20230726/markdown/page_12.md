Moving down to the Response line, down in July, you'll see a fueling spill; that was our final interagency exercise that we just completed on the 13th of this month, and we are currently training our roving security and fire watch teams to complete a culminating capstone event to move a couple diamonds to the right for the fire watch capstone event in August, to be conducted on the 16th and 17th.

Moving down to the bottom on the NEPA line, since our last update, we completed the 30-day public comment period in June, and we are on track to complete the NEPA process by the end of August.

Moving up one to the Ops line, we completed the dewatering process, which, as you may remember, removes water from the tanks and the pipelines to prevent corrosion and to ensure the quality of the fuel. A little bit to the right there, we did complete tank tightness testing, which ensures the integrity of the tanks. 

And a little bit further to the right there in July, we are currently in the process of draining the surge tanks. We should be complete sometime next week. This process will remove 480,000 gallons of fuel from the facility. Each of these evolutions are meticulously planned, trained to, rehearsed, response drills are exercised, and they are all each approved by the regulators before execution.
