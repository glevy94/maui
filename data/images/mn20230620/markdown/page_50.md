MR. UYENO: I would -- actually, I'll probably defer to the consultant who is on the call, but my understanding of the stormwater retention facilities is that they will -- they are intending to construct detention basins upstream to settle out any -- any particulate matter and all of that.

COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: Particulate, but not necessarily, you know, chemical that's --

MR. UYENO: Right. And maybe the consultant can speak to that more in detail.

COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: Thank you.

CHAIR CHANG: Is that Mr. Russell Arakaki? Are you the consultant?

MR. ARAKAKI: Yes, I am.

CHAIR CHANG: Okay, go ahead.

MR. ARAKAKI: Good morning, Chair, Members of the Commission. My name is Russell Arakaki. I work for Park Engineering, and I am the principal design engineer for the Koa Ridge Off-Site Drain Line No. 2.

To answer the question about chemicals, the Koa Ridge project is designing stormwater best management practices to meet the City and County of Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting's requirements for water quality, so we are following their rules. As far as the design, we are designing infiltration methods to get stormwater runoff in the ground where appropriate. There's also filtration systems.
