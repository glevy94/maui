DEPUTY MANUEL: They're coming next month.

(Laughter.)

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Okay. They're already on it, yeah.

DEPUTY MANUEL: Sorry, we try to get you the cutting-edge data.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Yeah. Well, WRRC hosted him, so the -- the recording might -- there might be a previous recording online, and then we'll hear next month. So I think that'll help us because it was really helpful to see his maps and -- and have that dialogue, so -- okay.

MR. IMATA: Shall I continue?

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Yep.

CHAIR CHANG: Yes, go ahead.

MR. IMATA: Okay, okay. So again, talking about -- now we're segueing into the Navy pumping centers. So I'm gonna show you on the next map the three shaft sources that the Navy has for the system. Aiea Halawa Shaft is the smallest source. This has an allocation of 0.697 mgd. Red Hill Shaft is sort of a -- I want to say a medium-sized source. It's definitely a lot smaller than the Board of Water Supply's Halawa Shaft, but it does have an allocation of 4.659 million gallons per day. Waiawa Shaft is the most productive shaft in the Waipahu-Waiwa Aquifer system, and it has an allocation of 14.977 mgd. And I will note that these are -- all are under a public water system.
