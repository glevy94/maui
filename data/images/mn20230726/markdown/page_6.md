I would like us to all welcome Commissioner Larry Miike for his first meeting with the commission. And again, thank you all for -- I'm hoping that I'm gonna get this -- this remote thing without too many glitches. 

I'd also like to introduce the staff, and I don't -- and again, I can't see everybody on the other side, but we have Deputy Kaleo Manuel, and Kathy Yoda is our secretary, and we have Deputy Attorney General Collin Lau. And as the staff present -- do their presentations, I'll ask them to introduce themselves.

I'd like to do agenda items protocol. We will hear items generally in the following order that's been posted on the agenda unless there's been a request for an item to be moved up. 

Ms. Yoda, have there been any agenda items that have been withdrawn or asked to be moved up? 

**MS. YODA:** No. 

**CHAIR CHANGE:** All right. Thank you so much.

**Item A1**

So, the first item on the agenda is the approval of the minutes of June 2023, Item A. Do I have any questions or comments? 

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani. 

**CHAIR CHANGE:** Yes.
