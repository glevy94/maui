Navy Closure Task Force Red Hill Update April 2024
RADM Steven Barnett, RADM Marc Williams, Capt. James Sullivan – Navy Closure Task Force
The Navy Closure Task Force presented the status of the decommissioning of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility and their efforts in environmental remediation and public health.
In previous years, your tank cleaning was cleaning tanks for putting fuel back. How is this different?
That’s a good question. If you go to the next slide...
I can hang on.
The short answer is where we used to do clean, inspect, repair to reinstate or reuse, now it’s clean, inspect, repair to decommission. Essentially the exact same process except for the tail end where the tank cleaning verification, which is really hey, making sure we’ve removed all product, that it’s met the regulatory expectations of, hey, the tank is now clean. Whereas before it would be hey, we would do tank tightness testing and other things so that we can place it back in service. Just really slightly different end state, exact same process up until that point.
I was just going to ask, what’s the size of your workforce?
Several hundred at the height of it and then you have, besides the folks that are in working throughout the tank, you also have folks running things back and forth to the port staging areas and so forth. As sludge comes out and it’s containerized, we don’t want to leave it up on the hill. We’re getting it out of there and stage it, so you’ve got lots of activity back and forth on top of ongoing regular facility maintenance that has to occur: elevators, electrical systems, legacy water system, all that routine maintenance that has to occur on an ongoing basis.
Sampling, continuing... 2
Yeah, sampling.
We have rovers that will be walking to see if there’s any of the water that’s leaking or dripping out. One thing I will tell you is that, by having a team doing the prep and then moving to prep the next and move to prep and then another team comes in. Hopefully what we’re going to see is that we’re going to get some best practice and some learning so we can kind of keep those same teams, lots of sets and reps just like a good football practice or something. Then hopefully we’ll be able to garner some speed at a safe rate there. The other thing is what I’m trying to get my mind around is how do we present this to the public to show what’s going on? We do have an app so we’re trying to think, whereas Admiral Wade and the JTF could show gravity doing its thing and taking fuel down thousands...how we represent that to show the community. We’re trying to get our minds around what’s a good optic to show because it’s going to move at the speed of molasses. It’s going to be kind of slow.
Has this presentation been given to your community advisory board?
Not yet because we want to make sure that we get the full approval. There’s been a skeletal discussion of how it’s going to happen but until we can get the DOH approvals and the final things, we want to go there but we can start turning that to kind of say this is...
You might even want to ask them. They’re lay people, you’ll have to figure out what’s the best way to communicate.
Even the pipeline removal, there’s pieces of pipeline removal that are in support of tank cleaning so the spools and some other things they have to take in order to hook up the ventilation system, we start to capture some of that 4,000 gallons of residual fuel. We’ve got 10 gallons captured, so we’re down to 3,990. How do you present that? And then it’s stuck at that number for months and so people wonder and then they start getting frustrated like, well why isn’t the needle moving? Because it’s very lengthy process.
Anecdotal, but I think maybe relevant to this is in Lahaina, during both the cleanup and the recovery, they’ve hired cultural practitioners or cultural monitors and I think those monitors who are actually from Lahaina has elevated trust, sensitivity but they are actually on the ground and they are part of the team. I think that they add a level of again, credibility and I think they have an interest. Something for you to consider is utilizing that kind of quality. Something to consider.
I’m familiar with that from my time in California using culture monitors there. Thank you.
I have an additional thought for you on that example you gave of being stuck on a number. The question is, is that where you’re supposed to be? If you establish milestones, you’re doing a much better job of having those highlight variants. Here’s the whole plan. It’s good to refresh our memory of the whole plan, especially when it’s long term, but focus on at least one slide or somehow embed on your slides an ability to speak to key variances. Variances can be good, variances could be bad, and they should be explained. So okay, we’re behind on this goal, we’re stuck here at this number because we’re behind on this goal because of a supply chain issue or a permit issue or whatever and we expect to get this and reforecast. Then we expect to get this done and here’s the new schedule, that way it provides transparency. Right now, it’s kind of overwhelming. We see the whole plan every time, it’s a little bit overwhelming but it’s coming before us quarterly so what was it for? What did we expect to have happen from the last quarter to this quarter. Did it happen on these key lines of effort?
You have this timeline and you just explained that on this top line that there’s potential delay because of the unexpected air quality monitoring. I think this is a lot of information. Broken down and explained a little bit more slowly, maybe you have people who are good at that for me it’s science translation, but you can do that. For engineers, you want to be efficient and provide as much information as possible in as little time as possible, but it’s drinking from a fire hose. You have some good materials. Pictures are useful, diagrams that don’t have all the complexity but the key parts. Especially for most people who’ve only seen it through a few pictures.
Presentation is important. We’ll take both of these for action, thank you.
While you’re on this slide, my understanding was that at Red Hill Shaft, the capture zone efforts were continuing for a certain amount of time during defueling. Is that part of this?
I actually have a slide in about four slides where I will focus all on...
I’ll wait.
Yeah, we’re going to talk about what we call GAC flow optimization shortly.
Are you keeping data on this? Can you show a graph that shows a trajectory of reduced report of complaint?
We do within that we’re continuing to work on the Safe Waters website to make sure that it’s more user friendly. All of the EDWM (Extended Drinking Water Monitoring) data will also go into there and we’ll continue to add graphs and ways that you can sort the data that’ll show the change in the number of detections, where those detections are, the maps that will lay all those out. So yes, all that’ll be tracked and will be available.
Even the kinds of contaminants?
You can sort by if you were only interest in a specific analyte, you can sort by that analyte. You can sort by all TPH, you can sort by a neighborhood. You can really toggle to sort any way that you want but we are also always interested in your feedback. As you play with the website, if there’s things that don’t work or new features that you would like, we’re open to those discussions as we continue to improve and also adapt it to where our goal is to make it more friendly for an app and phone as opposed to right now, computer-based where you got the whole screen is where it’s most effective and easy to use, but we do need to transition.
Summarizing some of that into a report. It’s one thing for us to go on, it’s available for us to go online and find it. But since you have a pattern of reporting to us, next update, just kind of bring [inaudible] instead of a data set telling us.
In some of the other meetings that we did not make one specifically for this but like at the FTAC and some of the other forums, we had a graph very similar that showed the detections of periods. I can show you an example of it, but that gives you the actual numbers and graphs and show the changes. We have these available, I did not bring an updated one for today’s forum.
We can look at that for the next update.
I have a specific question. You’re doing the same suite of targeted analyses as the long-term drinking water, are you doing VOCs and SVOCs or what methods do you use?
It’s still the VOCs, SVOCs, but it is a slightly different list of analytes and that was what was...so back in January, we pulled together all the drinking water experts from the Navy, we pulled in public health, the Department of Health, and the EPA all together to try to figure out...really there was two things. The first task was what is causing the low-level detections and I’ll hit on that in a moment on the next slide, but what is causing those low-level detections that we saw across the entire distribution system in period seven, even? Then the second thing was to develop what is the best plan going forward for after long-term monitoring completed in March of 2024, the Navy was not done. We were going to continue what should that be and so they talked about what are all those analytes that we could add that we should change, that we should focus on that really are not applicable and we should take out of it so that we can speed up the analysis and then any methods that should be changed. I’ll talk in a minute when we talk about the low-level detections and that the quenching the sodium thiosulfate that is now part of this system and talk about the difference about method 1815 and what we’re utilizing now.
I guess I asked because I’m aware that these hydrocarbons break down and change form so they wouldn’t necessarily look the same and are you adapting those methods to that.
And one thing that is important, one change of Extended Drinking Water Monitoring, the EDWM, is that when we do have detections in LTM, it had a list of, well first you flush, then you do this, and it kind of just laid out this is the process you follow. EDWM is a little bit more exploratory to try to figure out to where when we start to see detections, we don’t just follow a prescribed method, we actually do a lot more analysis on it. There’s a piano method and someone much more smart on chemistry that we could have explain it in the future. It’s much more diving into the science behind it, the forensics to figure out truly what could be causing those detections, not fuel related, but what else could it be and so forth. That’s kind of the focus of EDWM.
I commend you for this effort. It’s not lost on me that you’re doing this in context of lawsuits where the nature of this work and the release of information about it could create legal exposure, and yet the public health and well-being is being put as paramount here. I note that.
Yes, sir. We got to keep getting it right.
I’m a lay person, but I think I understood. Was this conveyed to the community? Because I know that they were not, they had some...
We’ve discussed this several times at FTAC, is where we really laid it all out and answered a lot of questions. We’ve also at the CRI and different forums like that we’ve had these discussions, we’ve laid it out within the military community. Captain Soho and Admiral Barnett held all of the command leaderships at the installation, brought them in, had this discussion. There is skepticism and there has been the argument, so you’re telling me you did 8,000 samples and they’re all erroneous? No, those 8,000 samples are still very, very valid and they proved what they could, but the fact that there was the noise and this chemical reaction, it doesn’t in any way invalidate that test but we just had to dig deeper to figure out what it is that was causing those low level. That was some of the concern that we have received from the public, so far. We do anticipate that as we continue to make sure all these technical documents are correct and agreed upon by the regulators and release those, we do anticipate more discussions and there are some individuals who are very passionate about it and the science is not necessarily going to matter because emotionally or physically, they are still experiencing symptoms that we can’t explain. They’re not going to believe it and we will continue to try to investigate further as well as to discuss it.
Which is why I wanted the medical team, even though I don’t have doctors, is why I want them to explain to help these folks who are presenting with items. We’re going to have to, kind of like you’re saying, as we get final approval from Washington DC to release this, we need to have a strat rollout plan which we’re working on and how do we communicate that because like you said, some folks are engineers, some folks aren’t. How do we get that out with the videos, fact sheets, and things like that.
Going back to the quenching issue, my understanding of this was that it would create false positives, correct? If the chlorination was causing these sort of elevated TPH detections but on the other side of it, the testimony that comes through, the complaints, people were still seeing sheens and odors. Has there been any progress in rectifying that? Sometimes it seems after someone comes back from a break and it might be in the household, has your team done a little bit more water quality focus?
That’s why it’s important for the Water Quality Action Team, when they show up, go there and they can say, well, show us the sheen that you’re talking about. Sometimes they’ll go, well, where are you getting the water from? Well, I’m getting it from my refrigerator. But when was the filter changed? That’s when the engineers come in and we can kind of say, hey, let’s pull the records, let’s see when you’re thing...or sometimes it may be the container that they put under there that may have some film. That’s why we want the water quality expert there that can do just that.
Has that been running very long? Have you guys started to?
It’s been probably a little over a month or so and there hasn’t been an ah ha! where we went to a house and unfortunately, it’s often that the report that’s called in is not what is seen necessarily by the inspector, but you even have...
We had the initial six houses that the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) did an investigation on in October and then the most recent they did 12 additional houses and most of those were identified via Facebook poll in the CRI. They weren’t even fed directly to us, they were fed to...the EPA really didn’t find anything that validated, but again, strengthened our approach of the Water Quality Action Team.
Have a systematic approach.
[inaudible] Is it a filter issue?
We went and took a water, we did an autopsy on water heaters. We went and took a sample, picked the one house that had...
It was the second highest reading we’d ever had on the installation and we pulled that water heater out and completely cut it apart, checked the internal components of it, sampled the water, sampled the, I’m losing the word of the heating element in there...
The coil.
While we didn’t come up with a lot of conclusive, we didn’t find any buildup of TPH, we didn’t find any gunk, anything that was concerning in that, but we’ll continue with efforts like that as required.
With the medical side, too.
That’ll help. I know we’ve talked and it’s not our Commission lane, but it’s still something that kind of keeps coming towards us. It’s really hopeful to know that there’s more coordination with the medical end of your [inaudible].
Sometimes I find from DLNR, if you can believe it, not everybody trusts DLNR. Sometimes it is helpful to get some independent assessment separate and apart from DLNR as a quality assurance for communities. I know we will never change some members perceptions or understanding of it, but I think sometimes it helps having that independent assessment other than us to give some credence to the results.
Admiral Barnett, could you put in perspective for me the efforts in the aquifer and the stability there because that affects a huge population. I know that a lot of your conversation has been focused above ground.
Drinking water. Once it’s into the system and once...
And rightly so; however, could you put in perspective work on the monitoring of the aquifer?
We always are very careful because we don’t want to confuse people talking about the difference between drinking water and groundwater and obviously we all know that they’re tied. Where do you get your drinking water from? It’s from the aquifer. First, all of our water continues to come from Waiawa Shaft which is six miles away, it’s not coming from the Red Hill Shaft. But at Red Hill, since the onset of the crisis and until today and as well as Admiral [inaudible].
Is there some part of the presentation that will [inaudible].
We actually for today’s presentation, we weren’t intending to go deep into remediation so I’ll talk just a couple minutes on that if that’s fine.
Thank you.
Within the remediation of the Red Hill Shaft, we do continue to maintain the Capture Zone which I’ll talk about on the next slide as required in the Red Hill Shaft Remediation Plan, was the plan that was developed at the onside of the crisis with the regulators and the Navy, again, which was the strategy for how we were going to recover the water quality of the aquifer. We continue to move forward that and maintain the Capture Zone and I’ll talk about the water that continues to be pumped into the stream in our efforts to try to reduce that. In addition to the Capture Zone, we continue to, like the WAI report had many great recommendations, many of which we’re already doing and will continue to do. Monitoring wells, we continue to drill monitoring wells and sample those on a regular basis to gain as much information as possible about any movement of contamination, any new spikes or like after we had the rain event over the last few days, I do expect we’re going to have some unusual results as it may have freed up any pockets. Any major rain events, we’ll see something unusual from time to time. So monitoring wells, the soil vapor, we continue to monitor soil vapor underneath all of the tanks, continue to expand the groundwater monitoring wells. I think some of your folks are part of the discussions, the SME (subject matter experts) level discussions where we’re trying to identify new locations where we can drill monitoring wells, working with Ernie Lau and Erwin on what those locations are for actual recovery. We’ve removed a lot of the soil, we talked about pilots that we’re interested in doing. We are actually right now kicking off the soil vapor extraction pilot to where we’ve got the equipment that is now set up. They’re doing some of the last walkthroughs this week with the intent of next week that system becomes operational. That’s where we are pushing air into areas that we believe through all of the characterization we’ve done, we’ve identified some places that we believe there’s some fuel that’s trapped, pushing air in. At the same time, we’re sucking air out and to try to pull anything that’s trapped. That’s just one pilot, we actually did get the letter this morning that’s the regulators had approved our natural source zone depletion study where we’re continuing to look at what can we do to increase the bugs eating the fuel that might be trapped in there. Do we add heat, do we add oxygen? What are those things that we can do to increase the consumption of any contamination. The site assessment that’s going on right now is part of looking at Red Hill as a whole facility. We’ve had a lot of focus following the 2014 releases and the 2021 releases at Adit 3 as well as the tank farm, but let’s look at Red Hill as an entire facility and right now the site assessment is being and developed. The work plan that looks at the history of the facility, where releases may have occurred, where other facilities used to lay, where there’s any potential risk in all of the areas that we need to sample and study to develop the complete comprehensive remediation plan for Red Hill. That’s being worked with the regulators right now. By this summer, June is when our first work plan is going to be submitted to them and the site assessment, while we wish it was a super quick, it’s going to take several years. It’ll identify additional sampling that’s required and then remediation focus in certain areas. As Admiral Williams mentioned, that remediation will continue for many years at Red Hill and the Navy remains committed to that. I’m not sure if that hit on any details, I’ll hit more on the Capture Zone here in a second.
Well, that’s the critical infrastructure item for the entire island and the civilian population that relies on that water source.
And one very important one that I failed to mention was the modeling that is occurring. There are two different models that are in effort, the Navy is working on our groundwater model to identify where we believe that any flow or any contamination from the past has gone as well as any future and the University of Hawaiʻi working their independent model, but we’re supporting them. Two different models are still in progress that will help inform what happens subsurface, where is the aquifer, where is it flowing.
That would be helpful, Admiral Barnett, maybe at the next update if you can focus on the remediation because to me, that’s our lane. I am also aware of the Red Hill WAI report and that report was not intended to supersede or circumvent in any way the existing regulators, DOH and EPA, but it was looking at approaches to accelerate remediation because just letting it sit for the next 30 years is probably not acceptable. But opening up Red Hill Shaft, that raises a lot of questions. What impact does that have? I think it would be really helpful to focus on that because to me, that is really key for CWRM.
Thank you, Commissioner Katayama for bringing us back to our focus and your encouragement that that should be a key part of the report to us. I get you reporting to another audience, maybe they’re less interested in that, but for us it’s pretty key.
My understanding was you have both groundwater model and the contaminant fate and transport model. Is that the one you’re also referring to? There’s two, [inaudible].
The fate and contaminate transport will come later. We’re still tracking to get the groundwater model, September 2024 is when we’re tracking to have that complete but it’s not going to be as much of that more 3D. The fate and transport model, that will come after that, we’ll continue to work on. It’s all part of the groundwater modeling effort, but deliverables will come in various stages of completion. The September one is not going to be the complete fate and transport model.
Given the monitoring wells, it seems like the whole release could provide basically a tracer in some sense to shape and inform the contaminate fade and transport model, which my understanding was the DOH has some of these back in 2023, had a lot of comments and they were being addressed.
They are being addressed as well as the University of Hawaiʻi that there will be a tracer study that we’re working with them on to actually put tracers in, and let’s get a real tracer complete analysis. Unfortunately, that’s not as quick as we would all love. It takes a little bit more time, but there will be a tracer study as part of the University of Hawaiʻi’s effort.
I’ve mentioned this before especially for more on the DLNR side, having better, for CWRM as well, monitoring of nearshore waters. What impact if anything are we seeing? And we need some good baseline, but we don’t have the resources to install some of those monitoring devices for nearshore waters or streams, just to see what impacts it may have on the ecosystem far beyond drinking water, ground water.
I think right now the only stream that we’re monitoring is the Hālawa Stream [inaudible].
I think we’d like an expansion of that just so that we can make some informed decision making on, just so the more information we know about where the fuel may have migrated to, if any.
Especially at the SME level when they get together and talk about that, the subject matter experts, like CWRM participates in a lot of the round tables and they can have a lot more of that, much beyond my ability to talk to.
Because I’d like to have our Division of Forestry and Wildlife who does watershed protection as well as our Division of Aquatic Resources who has interest in water quality. I think those need to be part of the conversation from a DLNR standpoint.
Any measures to accelerate that would be greatly appreciated. I mean that’s a lot of waste and if we could use that, whether it’s agricultural, R-1, flushing toilets, golf courses, something else other than waste.
As we mentioned, I know that Captain Sohaney, the Base Installation Commander, he’s briefed the Commission in the past. I know that he is always working at Admiral Barnett’s direction, water conservation measures across the base, understand that the pumping compliance, the 15 million gallons that we have at the Waiawa Shaft, measures that have been fairly effective to reduce the consumption to where we are right now, right at that rolling average. But our consumption has been drastically reduced and measures are in place and continue to be in place to how we can reduce.
I appreciate that but when we see all that water...
On the communication side, are you approaching that with the same rigor in terms of setting some targets and tracking your impact and progress? The nature, what are you using as descriptors are key indicators of whether people understand or whether you’re getting the message, it’s two-way communication. If there are some indicators there and that you could track and then show us as well as the general public, then they kind of know that your communications efforts are being effective. Clearly you’re communicating.
Are they being received, is it being effective? Measures of, what’s the word I’m looking for, measure of effectiveness. Got you, sir. I’m going to get with my public affairs team on that. I get briefs on that, but that’s a good point. Okay, so this is out there, did we hit the target?
Chair, this is probably the last time I’ll see these gentlemen on this side of the table. I just want to comment on the...
You coming to our side?
I got a uniform, I got a flight suit. I’ll get you a flight suit, sir.
I used to have one! The progress we’ve made in number one, accepting the mission, and then creating a coherent plan to achieve it and sustaining leadership towards it and resourcing it, is progress. The nature of our early conversations when this issue would come before us was fairly hostile and opaque and we’ve made great strides. Thank you for your leadership and as I depart and others step into the overseer role here for CWRM, I just encourage you to continue on the track of relentless pursuit of the targets and transparency about what’s working and what’s not working.
Commissioner Hannahs is going to higher ground, literally, he’s going to be leaving our commission and he has been confirmed to sit on the Mauna Kea Stewardship Authority. Literally, higher ground. His mission has changed, but his commitment remains the same, but his last meeting will be next month.
June.
June, two more months. Greatly appreciate it.
I just wanted to offer this, perhaps a hint or a piece of information that might be beneficial. Had some experience with diesel spills, light end product spills in Maui and also on Oʻahu in the past. One of the bets being as old as I am, as you look back and see mistakes people made in different perspective, but by way of a couple of hints. On Maui, small-scale spill of diesel into a sandy soil aquifer, was only about 30 feet down. Two things seemed to work in terms of remediating the aquifer and the soil’s condition. One is removing the soil, sending it to Arkansas and having it baked for a while to get rid of it that way. The other is skimming and the only thing that worked in terms of remediation of the water effectively was skimming, even pumping from a foot down, two feet down, five feet down into the aquifer was ineffective, relatively, because of the floating nature of the product especially a light end product like JP5. Secondly, there was another incident a larger, I believe it was in Wahiawa. It was Del Monte, it was a fuel truck that was fueling agricultural equipment several thousand gallons were spilled and they had a very similar problem. It was in a more perhaps comparable position, too, and you’ve got much more difficult circumstances, the depth of the aquifer, soils’ conditions are not uniform. But those were two areas that seem to be most effective at remediating those groundwater spills.
Within the capture zone, our skimmer operations are 24/7 right now. As the Capture Zone pulls it, but unfortunately we’re only able to skim what comes into the development tunnel.
Understood, but for what it’s worth. CAPT. 
Chair, may I ask maybe Dean or Ryan to look at the aquifer and sustainable yield with what the Navy is doing, what the Board of Water Supply is doing, the restoration of Red Hill, Hālawa and just look at context of the pressures that we’re seeing on that aquifer and the sense of urgency of restoring that Red Hill as a long-term source of water supply? I think that would help and put in context with what Captain Sullivan has just described to us.
Exactly.
I know we didn’t talk about it today but the Navy Aiea Hālawa Shaft, we also are working efforts for the reactivation of that shaft in the near future to include right now the installation of the same GAC technology we’re utilizing at Red Hill to where it is the charcoal but also a final tank that includes PFAS. The construction of that actually began this week so temporary facility, temporary treatment in order for us to push to reactivate Navy Aiea Hālawa Shaft to ease the burden of the aquifer in other areas.
Thank you, that’s very responsible. Appreciate that.
Modeling is critical, if we don’t know where that field has migrated, taking water out through those shafts may put it more at risk. I think everything’s sort of moving in... this is a very complex issue far beyond my understanding.
It’s a very fluid issue.
I do have one request and I think the PFAS treatment is something that hasn’t been discussed much so if you folks are able to at a future update on the aquifer remediation, share. I mean PFAS is an emerging contaminant, it’s something on the horizon for all of us and so I’m learning from your folks experience because DOD has the capital to do this kind of work.
We’re waiting on further guidance from DOD and so once we get that information, we’ll definitely look forward for opportunities where we can...
Share just what are the technologies available for that because I think turning on Hālawa Shaft, and I’ll just share from my tracking of the USGS conversations shutting off of Hālawa actually recovered some parts of the region. Head was increasing but the issue is the quality of the water and concerns about...
We need both, we need to understand both.
Right and together. Anyways, I think it would be really helpful and you guys have made huge strides and so there’s a lot to gain by getting this right. Appreciate that, thank you.
