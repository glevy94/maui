General Hashimoto, do you -- do you have additional presentation, or does this close your presentation?

**GENERAL HASHIMOTO:** Chair Chang, that concludes our slides. We want to say a big mahalo to everyone, the commissioners, for the opportunity to present this information about what we have been doing, what we are doing, what we plan on doing, and some things we really have to look forward to. Again, the big one, going back to Jason's initial presentation, is the start of the gravity train in mid-October for scheduled completion in January, which for historians of this crisis know that that will represent at least a year's worth of condensing of the timeframe for the safe and expeditious defueling of Red Hill, you know, which is about -- it's not about the water itself, but it's about the removal of the threat to the aquifer. So really appreciate this opportunity. We greatly look forward to our next time showing up here in front of the commission, and we've got the things that we'll bring back the next time we're able to get together.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Very good. Thank you, General Hashimoto and the team. Commissioners, do you have any final questions before I let the Navy team step down?
