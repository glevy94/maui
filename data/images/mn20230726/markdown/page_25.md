COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: You're giving me process, but I'm not hearing the substance of the criteria. Like such as the --

GENERAL HASHIMOTO: Cost, time, feasibility, and sustainability.

COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: So what -- so sustainability, what does sustainability mean?

GENERAL HASHIMOTO: That it can -- it's something that can be sustained politically, environmentally, financially in the long term.
