GENERAL HASHIMOTO: -- I guess after the brief to Congress, that will also be posted here too.  
COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Okay. Thank you for explaining this. It does help.  
GENERAL HASHIMOTO: Okay, thank you, ma'am.  
CHAIR CHANGE: Yes, Neil, go ahead.  
COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: Well, it strikes me that this briefing of Congress is very important in terms of creating their impression of the status of the -- of the issues and the background. Will you -- is that an independent briefing? Is it the Navy telling its story to Congress, or will it be reflective of Department of Health and state interests?  
GENERAL HASHIMOTO: So I'll have to get you more information on exactly who's gonna be presenting the brief itself, but it's gonna be input from those three independent efforts going on right now. So it's not gonna be the Navy's or a point of view; it's gonna be the collective point of view of all of the input we received and recommendations that we received regardless of the source of that.  
COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: So unless you're gonna have a representative team presenting to Congress, there probably should be a process to see what you're gonna say so that DOH and CWRM and other -- Board of Water Supply can look at it and say, yeah, that's -- you got it, that's what's going on here, so we all feel like Congress is being given an accurate view.
