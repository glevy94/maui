Task Force-Red Hill provide an update on the defueling operations. And we'll start with Lieutenant Colonel Wingear.

**LIEUTENANT COLONEL WINGEART:** Good morning. My name is Lieutenant Colonel Casey Wingear. I am the new chief of staff for the Joint Task Force-Red Hill. I replaced Colonel Kevin Williams, who briefed you last time in March. Although new to the position, I am not new to the joint task force. I joined the joint task force when it was stood up in September, and I've been serving as Admiral Wade's executive assistant and a planner on the team. Thank you for the opportunity to provide an update. It's truly an honor.

As you know, the mission is for the joint task force to safely and expeditiously defuel the Red Hill facility and to rebuild the trust with the people of Hawaiâ€˜i. When we assumed this mission, Admiral Wade was committed to building a plan to iterate and increase our understanding of that plan, to learn, and in partnership with the regulators, find ways to speed up the process to start and finish defueling Red Hill.

Next slide, please.

As you may remember, this is our Integrated Master Schedule, and I want to draw your attention to the yellow box on the top (inaudible) when we updated you last time. The (inaudible) we are on plan to commence gravity defueling starting in August -- October of 2023 with a completion date of January of 2024. This is five months earlier than briefed.
