COMMISSIONER BUCK: Yeah.

CHAIR CHANG: Eight years. This won't be the last time we see Mike.

(Laughter.)

CHAIR CHANG: I suspect that we are going to find an opportunity for our paths to cross again.

Taking Mike's place will be a new commissioner, who is -- who is new, but not necessarily new to the commission, Larry Miike, so he'll join us at the meeting in July.

But thank you again on behalf of both the department and the commission, Mike, for your years of dedicated service and for providing this commission -- I've read through many minutes -- just great guidance here. So thank you very much.

(Applause.)

CHAIR CHANG: I'd also like to introduce staff. Kaleo, if you could introduce yourself?

DEPUTY MANUEL: Aloha, Chair and Commission. Kaleo Manuel, Deputy, Water Commission. In person, we have Katie Roth, who's the head of our Planning Branch. We also have Dr. Ayron Strauch, who is with our In-Stream Protection Branch. We also have Kathy Yoda, who is TAing into our commission secretary position. And then we have Alexa Deike; she's our legal fellow. And then Barrett Won, obviously, with our IT. And then online, we have Ryan Imata, head of our Groundwater Regulation Branch, and then Dean Uyeno, head of our Stream.
