**KEOLA TALAROC:** I think it was leading up to December, there started to be a lot more regulation and discussion of what needs to be submitted with the permit applications. Prior to that, we did see closer to a 90 day turnaround once we got a confirmation that everything we have submitted has been reviewed and approved. It was closer than 90 days. For people to comment like ‘Aha Moku and Department of Water Supply, we would see an approval or denial of a permit application. Now, it's been over a year for some of our permits that are really only asking for 25 gallons a minute. Some of them are asking for water for their livestock. Things like that, I don’t necessarily feel should be given to you guys [inaudible]. Wells that only do 25 gallons a minute for small stuff is taking up a lot of your guys valuable time where we could be talking about wells that are going to help solve greater issues like affordable and low-income housing. Those are bigger wells that are going to have a lot more usage coming out of them and that's items that you guys should really be discussing and what impacts that might have versus a guy that wants water for his horses. You guys dissect things which is very good, but I feel like we need to aim what we're dissecting because right now when customers ask when will their permit be approved, I can't give them an answer. I say it has to be presented in front of the Board and then they say, okay well what's that schedule look like? And then I have to tell them, well they meet once a month and we only get the agenda six days before the meeting. It's very difficult for people to even have an idea of a timeline and we've also been asked the question, can we do this without a permit? We're not going to do that, but that's not saying someone else won't do it and if we have people doing illegal wells, then we have no way of tracking the impacts that is happening on our aquifer. It's just for the need of water, so that's all I have.  

**CHAIR CHANG:** Thank you very much, Keola. Your testimony has been very enlightening, to have real ground truthing on the impacts of our different processes. With the delegation being 90 days. Without the delegation, coming to the Commission, you're waiting for like about a year. Thank you, Keola.
