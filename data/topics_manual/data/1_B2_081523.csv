Approval of Surface Water Use Permit Application (SWUP.5880.6) for New Use and Special Conditions, Wesley and Jodie Mundy for 153,125 gpd; and Find that Amendment to SWUP.2157.6 issued to the Wailuku Water Company is Not Required; Waihe‘e Stream, Waihe‘e Surface Water Management Area, Maui, TMK: (2) 3-2-017:042
Dean Uyeno, CWRM Stream Protection and Management Branch
Mr. Uyeno stated the summary of request stands on its written submittal and read the staff’s recommendations as noted in the submittal.
Commissioners do you have any questions for Dean?
Before I do, should we hear from the applicant? I have a number of questions... Avery Chumbley’s.
Should I wait till then?
I’m kind of like interested in getting staff’s response to both. Well I’m interested in their response to Avery Chumbley’s letter.
I’ll just hold off, ok.  What’s staff response to that?
Frankly, I’m not fully aware of what’s going on on the PUC side, even though we did do some coordination or consult with them on West Maui as part of the West Maui designation. As far as Na Wai ‘Eha’s concerned, I think those questions would be best left to Mr. Chumbley and Mr. Geiger.
All right. With that being said, I think that was Commissioner’s request that we’ll hear from Wesley, the Mundys.
Good morning, Chair and Commission. My name is Wesley Mundy, this is my wife Jodie. We purchased this property close to two years ago and Jodie being from the area, her family’s been on Malaihi Road for about three generations or more. And there’s actually a family lot below us, about a mile that has been engaged in farming activity for that period of time that the family’s been here and as our goal to restore kalo to the area. We remember being up here on this particular lot with regards to taro and agriculture and just being part of this community. Thank you for taking the time to hear us and I’m gonna do our best to answer your questions.
I have a question for them.
No, please go ahead.
Mr. and Mrs. Mundy, you say you’re going to try to restore. Have you looked and researched the land to see whether it had appurtenant rights because your application says you’re not asking for appurtenant right nor are you asking for traditional and customary rights. Do you know anything about your land? And why didn’t you apply for appurtenant rights if you don’t know that it had water.
The reason we didn’t apply for appurtenant rights is when you look at the conditions related to this property. When Mr. Chumbley sold the property initially, I believe it’s Mr. Singer, it’s mentioned in there that the appurtenant rights or that service water rights did not transfer. So, it’s my understanding that there we do not have appurtenant rights on this particular property. However, if I’m wrong, I would be very happy to correct that and add that to the application.
Hi, thank you Chair Chang. Avery Chumbley, President of Wailuku Water Company. As a note I've been with the company now 41 years. Chair, before I talk about the B-2 application, I had tried to send a note to the secretary to provide a comment on your C-1 item and I would offer to the Commission, Wailuku Sugar Company has daily rainfall records going back to 1887, which is 136 years of rainfall records across Na Wai ‘Eha from Waihe‘e to Ma‘alaea. And we are more than happy to share that data and that information with the Commission. And we were recently recognized by NOAA and USGS for 125 years of continuous data submission so I offer that up. And I think as Commissioner Hannahs had noted it's important historical information.
Thank you very much Avery. You can send them to Ayron, send them to the Water Commission to...
He already submits them.
It's not quite that easy. It's in this big book about this thick. So, if you have somebody from UH that can come spend time and convert that into electronic data, I think it's worth your while.
Fair enough, fair enough. Okay, thank you very much you want to comment on B-2?
Yes, I do Chair. Thank you. We've provided detailed testimony, approximately 10 pages, and to put some of this into context I'd like to say this is the first time since June 28, 2021 which is 26 months ago, when the D&O was initially filed that there are SWUPA applications before the Commission for delivery service off of the Wailuku Water Company system. There have been four previous SWUPAs awarded, three of those were directly off of Wailuku River. One of them was directly off of Waihe‘e River. So, this is the first time that SWUPAs have been up for consideration off of the Wailuku system. We take no position on the volume of water sought by the applicant or the proposed allocation in the staff submittals. We do however, have concerns over jurisdictional issues and significant operational issues. Our detailed testimony talks about some of the jurisdictional issues and I'd like to ask our Council Jim Geiger to expand on some of that. They are complex legal issues that I think that this Commission needs to consider before it takes any action today. So, with your consent Chair if Jim could explain some of that.
Yes. Please go ahead, Mr. Geiger.
Thank you, Chair, Commissioners, Avery. We have an issue of concurrent jurisdiction that we're facing with this particular Surface Water Use Application. Wailuku Water Company has a surface water use permit issued by this Commission and we have to follow the terms of that particular permit. In addition, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission because we are a regulated utility. One of the conditions that we have imposed on us by the PUC is that we have to maintain the status quo; we can't take on new customers, we can't change any rates, and we basically can't deliver more than what we are, what we did. So, if this permit is granted without having consulted with the Public Utilities Commission and gotten some agreement and understanding with how their jurisdiction impacts this particular permit, we are faced with either potentially either violating this Commission's directives or violating the Public Utility Commission's directives. And I don't think that the Commission wishes to put anyone, whether it's us or any applicant or any permit holder, in that untenable position. In review of the staff report I noted that there was no indication that the Public Utilities Commission had been contacted even though we were aware that there was a memorandum of understanding between the Commission and the Public Utilities Commission. That was confirmed by Dean's comments or earlier that in fact the staff had not contacted the Public Utilities Commission with regard to Na Wai ‘Eha permits. We think that it would be very important for this permit application as well as future permit applications if that consultation was had and the staff of the Commission as well as the staff of the Public Utilities Commission could meet together with us so that we could determine the best way to handle these types of requests. I don't think anyone wishes people who have an application and rights to receive water be denied water, but at the same time I don't think this Commission or anyone else wants to, by their actions, put a permit holder in violation of another permit or certificate. And so our position on this is that we believe that a short deferral of the application would be appropriate to allow Commission staff, PUC staff, and the company to coordinate as per the memorandum of understanding on how best to handle these type of applications. And if there are any questions, I'll be happy to answer the questions.
Thank you very much, Mr. Geiger for the explanation. Commissioners, do you have any questions? So, I mean what I'm hearing you say Mr. Geiger because I got a copy of an MOA, but it's not signed. Do you know whether this is in effect?
We do not. We believe that the Commission approved the MOU/MOA, but we have not seen a signed copy either.
Okay, but you're not necessarily suggesting that the MOU prohibits each PUC or CWRM to exercise their own authority, but what you're suggesting is pursuant to the MOU there should be some coordination?
Both pursuant to the MOU and the fact that there is concurrent jurisdiction. In this case, you know, you may have other situations where you have Water Management areas where you do not have a regulated utility. Obviously in that case the concurrent jurisdiction would not come into effect. But in this case because we have a regulated utility in a water management area, both the Public Utilities Commission and this Commission have jurisdiction and we want to make sure that what one board does, does not place a permit holder in jeopardy before the other board.
Okay yeah, I understand what you're saying. Yes, Larry?
From what I understand, by the way Avery you're looking good after 20 years and I haven't seen you in a while. I know I'm not looking good.
Good to see you, Larry. You still have dark hair, mine's all white.
I haven't dyed it yet. From what I understand every submittal, there's a direct conflict here. The PUC saying we can't, they can't change any of the water and then we're saying we're going to give it to them if the Commission approves. So I'm sorry, Commissioner Meyer has his hand up.
Oh no, go ahead. I'm sorry, I do have a question for Counsel Geiger. I wanted to ask, it would seem that this has potential to invalidate the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity of the Utilities. Is that in fact the case? Seems contrary to the rules and regulations of that certificate.
We are concerned that the action that this Commission takes would in fact have an adverse impact on the Certificate of Need and Necessity before the PUC, yes.
That would be my impression as well.
And that's why we think coordination and communication is critical for these permits from this point forward.
Yeah, I wish I'd had more time in this one to research it myself, but thank you. Chair, I would recommend that we refer this to the AG for further review. I think it's a significant enough issue that the Commission really ought to be on firm ground here, but a deferral for a month would certainly be adequate for researching that question, I would think. Thank you again. I'm sorry to interrupt, Mike and please carry on.
I see Mr. Mundy has his hand up. Did you want to clarify something? Go ahead.
Well, I just wanted to make a make a point with regards to and to be fair I'm not familiar with the public utilities, the permit and that process, but however from what Mr. Geiger said, things need to be maintained as a status quo with regards to the draw on the water and we're not requesting an additional draw on what's currently flowing. We're just asking to be able to utilize what's already flowing through our property. And put that to proper use as opposed to just going down the drain so to speak. So anyways that's the point I wanted to make.
Mr. and Mrs. Mundy, do you have any objections? Mr. Meyer has suggested a deferral, Commissioner Meyers, based upon...there are other people here who may want to testify, but do you have an objection to a one-month deferral?
I mean with regards to it being reviewed, Madam Chair. Chair Chang: By the Attorney General, yes.
I have, I can wait for their response.
Do you have any objections to a one-month deferral?
At this point, I mean I don't see how one month deferral would necessarily impact our total production. We were hoping to move forward on however, the purpose or the question with the deferral is does it affect their current PUC? And it really, our request shouldn't affect that because we're not asking for an additional draw, we're just asking to utilize the current draw. But in regards or respect to your question, we wouldn't have a problem with the deferral, no. But just as long as, yeah.
Thank you. I appreciate the cooperation. I see Hōkūao’s hand up. Go ahead Hōkūao.
Aloha Chair Chang, Commissioners. I have a testimony that I wanted to provide, but I’d just like to ask before going into that, that everybody pause on any decision making in regards to this only because the next water use permit application applicant that's coming up is off of the same system. It's a family that has generational ties to Wai‘ehu. Yes, they're utilizing the same system. It's a family that has been waiting for water for a very long time. I'm concerned that any type of deferral, even a month, when the reality of that sometimes can take much longer. That's a family for sure that has been waiting to receive water to restore, not restore, to reopen their lo‘i that have gone dry for some time now. So, I just, I think before any decision, I'd like to see if that next applicant could also be a part of this discussion or at least sharing out that that piece.
Thank you very much, Hōkūao. Is there anybody else? Oh, Mr. Mundy your hand is up.
Apologize and thank you, Hōkūao or Mr. Pellegrino for your insight. We're very familiar with the next applicants. They’re our neighbors who've actually been very helpful to us in understanding some of the history and to my wife, the lineage that their two families actually share. Their grandparents actually farmed the same land together. We found out through conversation and some records and archives and whatnot that my mother-in-law had. But with regards to this, would it be possible to get maybe get in a or maybe with an approval subject to a later review by the PUC be an option also? I just thought I'd present that.
I want to respond directly to that, but you know Mr., Commissioner Miike had a good number of questions. I want to make sure that we honor your interests.
Yeah. I have several things. By the way Hōkūao how are you doing also? I haven't seen you in a long time. I assume Hōkūao, I'm assuming you're talking about the Ho‘opi‘i application?
Yes, Commissioner Miike.
I don't have any concerns over the Ho‘opi‘i one right now on these issues about to raise, but I do have some about the Mundy. According to the application you folks didn't ask for either appurtenant rights or traditional customary rights and yet the Commission staff is suggesting the traditional and customary rights. It's sort of like unique to me that an applicant asks for something and the Commission is going to give them something they didn't ask for. Well, that's one thing. The other thing is that I'm not clear and I'm assuming this is being guided by the contested case which was then issued as a decision in order which according to, I think Avery's thing is on oral arguments in front of the Supreme Court next month and ends in September. But the way that this decision and order is written is not clear to me in terms of traditional and customary rights. First of all, it says that any applicant who qualifies as a Native Hawaiian and who does not intend to grow kalo for commercial purposes qualifies. And then it also says that in the executive summary that an applicant's is separate from the land. So, what I read that is and Julie can answer this, is that mean that any Hawaiian, who can meet the definition of Native Hawaiian in essence, descendants from citizens of the Hawaiian Kingdom, regardless of whether they have a history of traditional and customary rights have now the right? Is that correct Julie?
I'd like to go into executive session to discuss this if you want to.
Oh, why? I'm just, okay anyway that's one question. The second question of that part is, it looks as though as far as the land it had to have been used according to the decision and order. It had to have been used before 1892 for these kinds of practices. Not a problem with that, but the current Supreme Court decision says that an applicant had to have traditional and customary rights that trace back at least to 1892. And from the decision and order it looks like that no longer is a requirement. Also, in the executive summary says that the statement that it is established that the application of a custom has continued in a particular area. It's ascribed to me, well no, that's a direct quote from PASH. I'm clear and we can go into executive session as Julie suggests. Is that now being, is this decision and order saying that you're breaking away from that? If any Native Hawaiian going into an area that was had traditional and customary practices now has the right and I'm distinguishing between a practice that is traditional and customary versus the right to that practice. Okay, looking back at my, in an executive session I brought along my proposed D&O versus the final D&O and I'll show you what was kept out and what was kept in. Okay, so that's one question I have is that whether we're talking about Mrs. Mundy because her family lived in that area qualifies or whether just because she's Native Hawaiian she qualifies. From what I just heard you say Mr. Mundy, your wife's family has actually been there for a long time and so I just want to know whether they just happen to live in the Na Wai ‘Eha area or whether they were actually living maybe right on the land that you now own and whether your family really can qualify on what the current Supreme Court qualifications are. Okay, the second part is that for 45 years now, the second part is your understanding that your appurtenant rights were extinguished when the land was sold. For 45 years now the Hawaii Constitution said that it preserves appurtenant rights and for 36 years, the Hawaii Water Code has definitely stated that appurtenant rights are preserved and the only difference between riparian rights and appurtenant rights is that riparian rights cannot be severed because a Supreme Court had ruled that they had a statutory basis and that appurtenant rights don't. Well we now have a statutory basis since at least 1987 and a constitutional basis since 1978. And then in the D&O which also was in mine, a decision about a Supreme Court stands and I quote, until the decision has been reversed or overruled by the court of last resort in the Hawaii Supreme Court or there's another issue or altered by legislature in that I addressed the legislator enactment piece in my proposed D&O. That was taken out of the D&O and the conclusion was reached that the Supreme Court has not acted. So, from my standpoint since at least 1987 and probably since 1978 the Supreme Court has already ruled that you cannot sever an appurtenant right anymore. So, what I would say is that if they go through this thing, the Mundys to me, probably can prove, you would have to do this though, that they not only have traditional and customary rights under the current standard, but they also have appurtenant rights under what I say should be the law.
Okay, you want to go into executive session?
I'm not sure if we're going to go to executive session, but I have just a simple question that's kind of apart from the D&O issues that Commissioner Miike has raised. Mr. Chumbley, what constitutes a customer to you? Are they going to be, what's your criteria and do the Mundys meet that?
Okay yeah, Commissioner Hannahs this is where it gets a little bit difficult over the cross-jurisdictional overlap between the PUC. The original PUC document that we filed along with the amended document, amended application calls for the CPCN [Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity] to be issued as two categories of users. A user was identified as someone who was getting a delivery of water from the Wailuku Water Company system which could mean the kuleana users or any other institutional type users. And then there was the category that we identified as customer which were the individuals under contracts or license agreements. So, in the case of the application, both the users and the customers are generally within the same definition as someone receiving service from the Wailuku Water Company system.
So, the second part of the PUC order that prohibits you from adding any new customers would apply to users as well?
We believe it does, yes. Now I would also mention that the risk of a violation of the suspension order with the PUC puts all of the users within Na Wai ‘Eha at risk, not just the Mundys and not just the Ho‘opi‘is. It's everybody because if we are deemed to be in violation of that suspension order, the PUC basically could shut us down. That means no one gets water, including the County of Maui and including all the kuleana users. So, this jurisdictional overlap is something that really needs to be addressed between the Water Commission and the PUC before any new applications are approved that take water out of our system. The four applications that were previously approved since the D&O was issued, were all directly off of the river or the stream, so they had no impact to the Wailuku Water Company system. Now if Mundy and Ho‘opi‘i could take water directly off of North Wai‘ehu stream and not out of our system, it may not be a violation of the suspension order. But we still just don't know that until we have this exchange between the two overlapping jurisdictions.
Or it may be that users don't constitute customers in the PUC's eyes but that needs to be clarified and going back to Mr. Mundy's point, just as an alternative pathway to outright deferral might be a kind of approval subject to receipt of confirmation from the PUC that the action does not constitute a breach of the PUC order that regulates Wailuku operation. I'm not offering that yet but there's a couple of pathways that we have.
I think Commissioner, you know I don't want to prolong the applicants permits, but I'm concerned that any approval and authorization of a permit today by the Water Commission puts that CPCN at risk. And I don't mean this as a threat, but if a conditional approval or even an outright approval would require me to ask for a contested case. There's too much at risk here. A deferral of 30 to 60 days to work with the PUC and get this resolved is really the right thing to do for B-2 and B-3 applications.
Thank you for your testimony.
Commissioners, do you have any other questions or is there a motion? I think, yes.
If we are going to defer it, I would request that of the issues that I raised that the staff, if they are going to continue to recommend, address my issue which is whether they can find out from the Mundys whether they may have T&C rights under the current law and the appurtenant rights, but mainly with T&C law because the way that it's written now, just because the Mundys lived there they were given T&C rights. It's just not, inadequate as far as I'm concerned. So anyway, it will help to clarify as well.
Okay, no I appreciate that.
So, the deferral, but you really have two purposes: one, to sit with PUC resolve those issues if we can and secondly, have staff sit with the Mundys to review T&C, their rights.
And clarify because it's very fuzzy right now.
Chair, has the issue with, related TNC use for home-use only been clarified? What can you do with any surplus production?
Kaleo, I don't. My understanding is under Article 12 Section 7. We are obligated as a Water Commission to ensure that traditional customary practices are preserved and protected. So, there is a separate analysis that goes into all of the Water Commission action to do a separate traditional customary practice analysis and that is one to ensure that. And I mean I too I have a little, maybe I disagree with a little some of our analysis, but essentially the analysis is to determine does the applicant’s proposed use have an impact on traditional customary practices? Now in this case the applicant may actually be a practitioner who's entitled to separate rights, but I think our analysis as a Commission is to determine that the action that's before us, is our action granting this permit going to impact traditional customary practices? This one, the analysis is on the applicant and I don't really think that that's the appropriate analysis. I think the analysis is identify what the traditional customary practice is or what the resources are, two what impact does the proposed action have on traditional customary practices, and then three the mitigation. But in this particular process we are treating, we're determining whether the applicant has traditional customary practices. That to me is an independent, I mean they either have it or they don't, but that's not the analysis that we go through. To me that shouldn't be the analysis and because you know the burden. And we're using a Hanapī, that was a criminal action where the burden shifted. The burden shifted because Hanapī utilized traditional customary practices as a defense to criminal trespass. So, the court says that in the context of criminal trespass the burden shifts to, in that case, Mr. Hanapī, but in the case of us in a civil action the burden is ours or the burden is the applicants. I shouldn't say the burden. The burden is the applicants to demonstrate that their actions will not impact traditional customary practices. I'm sorry, that’s a long-winded kind of explanation.
So, are we clear on the path that we’re taking?
All I'm saying is that, I agree with all that. All I'm saying though is that it was the staff that took on the burden of which is the applicant’s to prove that they have traditional and customary rights. If it's Mundy, I don't have any problem with the staff helping them on that, but what I don't understand is that the way that the decision and order on the Nā Wai ‘Ehā cases, it's so general that I have no idea what they're talking about to satisfy being a traditional and customary practice which has a right to it.
Yeah and I guess I, look at now. Commissioner Hannahs: Mr. Mundy, Mr. Mundy.
I mean I'm going to take first Mr. Mundy and then I'm going to take Hōkūao. Go ahead Mr. Mundy. You have a question?
Thank you, Chair. No, I wanted to just address the question of why we didn't put in, go for Hawaiian rights and again appurtenant rights which I explained why we didn’t look at that initially. And with regards to the Hawaiian rights, this being our first process of doing an application like this after the application was submitted, we had learned about those options and we were told that this forum here would be an opportunity to bring that up and to talk about it more. So obviously we're more than happy to abide by what the process is and to add what needs to be done. So just wanted to make sure we answered that question.
Because you said, Mrs. Mundy, is it your grandfather or grandmother they are related to the Ho‘opi‘is who are from the area?
No, they're very close friends.
Oh, close friends okay.
Yes, and they worked at the farm, the taro farm before.
But you are not from, are you from this ahupua‘a? Are you from this area? Jodie Mundy: Yes, I am. I was brought up here.
Do you know whether your family also grew taro in this area? Jodie Mundy: Yes, yes.
Okay, okay. So, I think the point that we're trying to make is you may have the right to continue to exercise traditional customary practices independent of any appurtenant rights. Your rights run with the land as someone who has a lineal connection to that place through your ‘ohana, that you have independently traditional customary practices that you can assert which is the forms of basis for why you have the right to use water. Which is a little different from appurtenant rights or one that comes with, I mean you have an inherent right as someone if you can show that your ‘ohana did practice there. Hōkūao, did you want to say something?
Yes, you know whether there's going to be a deferral or not, I just wanted to be on record to at least provide a little bit of our testimony in support of the Mundys and the requests for kuleana water regarding their Surface Water Use Permit. The use that they are requesting is in direct alignment with the work of our organization and you know while the staff support and recommending this approval of the water use permit is now on the table, we just would like to thank the staff for the work, the Water Commission staff for their initial support. And if the Mundys need any assistance in working on their appurtenant rights requests or just any kind of information in regards to their lineal and cultural ties to Wai‘ehu. Hui o Nā Wai ʻEhā is there to support them and happy to work with them to ensure that they are receiving the type of support on all levels. So, Hui o Nā Wai ʻEhā is again in support of their water use permit application. Mahalo.
Thank you for that offer, that's very kind of you. Do I have a...Commissioners, do you have any other questions or a motion?
I have just a reflection of what I'm hearing. It sounds like the applicant and staff have to kind of revisit the application given the additional knowledge they now have. The staff have some homework to reach out to PUC to clarify and make sure that what we're doing doesn't create more tangles and that you had a request on the Ka Pa‘akai analysis part of it, as well. So, staff have two assignments or three assignments. The applicants have another assignment. Is that, am I getting that correct?
I think so. I mean I will tell you I am, I need to have a better understanding and maybe I think Julie suggested we go into executive session, but what the impact of this MOU. Because I cannot imagine PUC asserting jurisdiction over, I mean we have to be able to work independently so. But what I'm hearing you guys tell us both Mr. Geiger and Mr. Chumbley is that the difference is it's how the water is being taken out of the system. If the Mundys would be taking water directly out of the stream as part of their traditional customary practice that's different versus they're taking it out of your system, is that correct? And the fact that they're taking it out of your system is what triggers the PUC and that order? Okay, okay. Hōkūao, do you have a clarification on that?
Yeah, I do want to make one point is that although the source of water for these two applicants are coming from Wailuku Water Company’s system, you know first and foremost that you know the original intakes and the po‘owai for these users were likely obliterated at the time of plantation which forced them to connect to these systems, but secondly the ‘auwai system that flows to these particular properties, both including the Mundy’s and Ho‘opi‘i’s and others’ below them, is actually the traditional system. A good portion of it is the traditional system. So, you know I want to make note that while maybe the intake and the source now currently comes from the Waihe‘e Ditch, the system that flows forth is still very much part of that original traditional infrastructure. And so again I don't know if that has any play in all of this, but I think that's important to note that not the entire infrastructure is not necessarily Wailuku Water Company, but the intake portion is, which has, you know, they don't have any other choice to be connected to that system. Mahalo.
It does seem like there's a factual question and then there's a legal question. Do I have a, Kaleo, do you have a recommendation? Oh Mr. Mundy, your hand is up.
Thank you, Chair. Just and again just to point out with regards to the draw on the water. We're not asking to be an additional draw on the ditch. This water is already flowing and is already servicing farmers below us and we're just asking to be able to use what's currently flowing through. And as far as being a customer I guess that would come under the decision of the PUC, but with regards to the actual use and the impact on the system we're not looking to be an additional impact on the system. It's already flowing and with regards to, as I understand the Ho‘opi‘is and not to speak for them in any way shape or form, but just to point out when you walk the Waihe‘e Ditch which flows behind our property you can see that the mechanisms for distribution still exist just at some point in time they were damaged, not repaired. And so this kuleana water flowing from you know a source up in the mountains doesn't start at the Waihe‘e Ditch. It starts at another location as Mr. Pellegrino pointed out. So, and again our intent is not to be an additional impact on Mr. Chumbley's operation, it's just to currently use what's already flowing through the area. Thank you again.
Thank you. Kaleo, did you want to make a recommendation or?
Yeah. Hearing what’s said, I think maybe to clarify the MOU with PUC and our staff conversations with their council as well as their staff. The MOU really was about consultation and data exchange and as part of this process as we're getting through and issuing new Surface Water Use Permits or going through that process, there are rules right? We have to put a public notice out. During that period that's when we expect these comments to come out. Unfortunately, for various reasons people don't always participate in that set time period and it comes up at these meetings before we get testimony or these concerns. So totally hear Wailuku Water and Commissions concerns. Similarly, we can reach out to PUC more directly per the MOU agreement and then we can coordinate that or at least ask them for their comments and their feedback on this and try to bring it back in a timely manner. So, I'm not against deferral to provide more facts and data to you folks so you feel comfortable making any decisions. I don't, I'll ask Dean, maybe Dean has any comments as well as staff that's going to have to work on this. But I guess pre- deferral or even pre-executive session if that's where you folks decide to go, you might want to take up B-3 as well since Ms. Ho‘opi‘i is here, but in the waiting room and maybe have that deferral one time. I don't know if that's an option.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah, I'm open to that if the, I mean is the Commission, are you open to that option? You know we'd put this in advance here B-3? Yeah, yeah because they seem to be similarly situated.
I just wanna, since she's here, give her the opportunity. Chair Chang: Yes, yes, yes.
I'm assuming the similar testimony from Avery and folks as well as Hōkūao would apply to B-3 also. Just want to make sure we get that on the record if there is a deferral, so there's direct items to staff on what those follow ups are going to be.
Right, right. Very good. I mean I think that's efficient. I respect consistency.
Okay, hang on. So, Mr. Mundy, we're going to hold your item. We're going to hear from Mrs. Ho‘opi‘i and then we're going to try to make a ruling on both, okay? So just hang on tight.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you very much and likewise Mr. Chumbley, Mr. Geiger, and Mr. Pellegrino because I suspect it's the same so just hold on tight. Go ahead, Dean.
