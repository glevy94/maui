Department of Health Update on Red Hill Response and Remediation
Commissioner Ho asked Ms. Joanna Seto, DOH Environmental Management Division Chief, to
introduce the Department of Health team.
Ms. Seto stated that the DOH will give a brief update of the situation at Red Hill and introduced the DOH team: AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Foam) HEER Incident Case No. 20221129-1438:Ms. Liz Galvez
PFAS Environmental Action Levels: Mr. Roger Brewer
DOH Emergency Order: Ms. Kelly Ann Lee and Commissioner Kathy Ho
Aquifer Monitoring and Recovery: Ms. Fenix Grange
Red Hill Shaft Filtration and Discharge into Halawa Stream: Ms. Joanna Seto Ms. Seto introduced Liz Galvez, HEER (Hazard Evaluation & Emergency Response) 
I have been asked to present current information for the AFFF incident. On November 29, 2022, at about 12:30 pm/1:00 pm the Navy reported that a worker discovered an AFFF release. At about 2:38 pm the Navy notified DOH that approximately 1,100 gallons of an aqueous film forming foam concentrate was released in the tunnel and it impacted areas such as Adit 6 itself, it went out of Adit 6 onto the asphalt and down the soil area and a culvert. My coworker and I went to the scene at approximately 3:30 pm and what we had discussed with the Navy on scene coordinator that was present on site, was to make sure that they delineated the spill and immediately remove the AFFF impacted media. We requested for EPA’s technical assistance. DOH also requested a response action plan and a written sampling plan for soil and groundwater knowing the importance and gravity of the AFFF that was released. DOH has been overseeing the cleanup action and the cleanup response that has been going on at Red Hill and DOH did receive the emergency response sampling plan for soil and groundwater on November 30th. The Navy and DOH along with EPA’s assistance came to an agreement with the sampling plan for soil and groundwater. DOH also requested for a waste management and disposal plan. DOH wanted to ensure that the waste was handled properly, and the disposal can be tracked from cradle-to-grave. In addition, we wanted to make sure that there is a decontamination plan for Adit 6. The Department of Health issued a notice of interest requesting for those things and additionally wanted to make sure that they provide us with other AFFF releases that had happened in the past to ensure that the cleanup is done properly. As part of our mandate, the Department also expected to receive from the Navy a 30-day written follow-up which DOH received. The first part of the cleanup was to do exterior excavation. The initial excavation is complete and they had collected approximately 150 cubic yards and that is currently stored off- site awaiting analytical results of how to and where to dispose of it. On December 14, we had approved a temporary cap of asphalt to prevent potential contamination from spreading and this action reduces the risk to public health and the environment. As the operations were ongoing 24/7 we were there and we could clearly observe the rains would collect in plastic covered excavated areas, so upon further discussion with the Navy it was best that they temporarily cap it knowing that depending upon the sampling results, that more work needs to be done and they are prepared to do the excavation. Sampling has also been done for soil and groundwater, sampling for groundwater wells continues to be done weekly. For the wells, we are awaiting validated data and results will be discussed with the EPA and the Navy. Are there any questions? Thank you.
I just had a question, I got a little bit confused, so have you received the response plans, sampling plans, waste management and disposal plans?
Yes, we have received those, and they are posted online on our website.
Have they met DOH expectations?
It had undergone reiterations and with emergency response plans those plans change depending on the situation. The latest one that is posted is the current one. The waste disposal plan is also posted on our website. The DOH had provided comments and we will be working with them but know that in the meantime the waste has not gone anywhere. Thank you. Ms. Seto introduced Roger Brewer, Senior Scientist, Department of Health
For the past 30 years one of my job tasks is to compile toxicity information for different compounds working with toxicologists to develop action levels as we call them for different compounds and drinking water. The EPA has posted drinking water screening levels for three, or four maybe five PFAS by now. We’ve been doing other studies around Hawai‘i and we know we need a lot more than that so I’ve been talking with multiple states around the U.S., compiling information they have as well as the EPA and we have drinking water action levels now for 19 almost 20 of these compounds and we’re still working with other agencies to continue compiling data. It mostly reflects information the EPA has published but again that is limited so we’re working with other states giving presentations to multiple states plus EPA headquarters on what we’re doing. Ms. Seto introduced Kelly Ann Lee, Red Hill Project Coordinator
I am going to give a brief summary of work being done under our Emergency Order that was finalized on May 6, 2022. It requires the Navy to close and defuel the facility as quickly and safely as possible. In November 2022, the Navy with our oversight was able to unpack one million gallons of fuel from the facility pipelines without incident. Now that the facility is unpacked, the Navy can begin doing repairs. On November 1st they gave us a list of 253 repairs that were recommended before safety defueling can occur. We are working with them to shorten that list to expedite the defueling timeline so repairs that are redundant or represent a low risk if they do not occur, we are giving the Navy permission to remove those repairs. For example, two weeks ago we approved a deviation from the repairs list that the Navy tells us may shorten the defueling timeline by three months. That’s the sort of thing we’re going for. Now I’ll talk about the closure side. On November 1st as well, we received the Navy’s closure plan. We found it a little lacking in detail, so we provided a list of 86 questions to them, and we are awaiting their response and we have not yet approved the closure plan.
As you probably all know, the Navy and EPA are about to enter an Administrative Order on Consent. The EPA was required to come out for public hearing which took place on Wednesday and Thursday, the DOH participated in a science fair project to talk about all these things that are going on at Red Hill. The big question that came up to us is why isn’t the DOH a party to the EPA and the Navy’s Administrative Order on Consent? That really is because the Department of Health feels very strongly that its administrative order is protecting the public health and the environment, and we want to ensure that we don’t yield any of our regulatory authority to anyone and keep it within the state. Does anybody have any questions on the Emergency Order or the AOC emergency order interface?
I haven’t tracked this as much recently so this is a different Administrative Order on Consent?
That’s correct. There was a 2015 Administrative Order on Consent that the EPA just entered and is doing a 2023 Administrative Order on Consent [Administrative Consent Order]. It’s online and they are taking public comment until February 6.
What does this mean for the regular voting public?
The DOH had its Emergency Order and EPA did not have something similar so this Administrative Order on Consent [Consent Order] allows them to regulate the defueling/decommissioning aspect of it. There are other aspects of it that you should read if you are very much interested but that’s the gist of it.
This is not a question, Chair this is for your radar screen. Last administration formed a Permitted Interaction Group which strongly recommended that we use further regulatory authority of the Water Commission specifically to modify their water permits to assure that long term recovery would happen. That motion was unanimously approved by the full Commission, there was some resistance to implement that at the end of this last administration and I think some of this may be better discussed in executive session which I’m not recommending now but Deputy Manuel is totally aware of the issue and can brief you. I think we want to give you some time to absorb the full breadth of the Red Hill situation but that is because it was unanimously approved by the Water Commission that’s an issue that we would like to discuss with you and in cooperation with the Department of Health sometime for future Water Commission meetings. Thank you.
Thank you very much Mike, appreciate getting the update on that and I will get briefed by Kaleo regarding the status of Red Hill and Water Commission’s interplay and the current situation. Thank you. Are there any other questions by the Commissioners? Kathy, I just want to confirm the fact that DOH is not a signatory to the Consent Order, you are still retaining your regulatory authority and oversight on the Navy’s compliance with your own resolutions?
Very much so with our Emergency Order.
Are you ready to go toe to toe with them?
Yes, of course I am. I’m ready to protect public health and the environment.
I know you are, and I appreciate that very much. Thank you so much.
Is there any kind of environmental surveillance that is being conducted that the Navy isn’t doing, or a Navy contractor isn’t doing just as the defueling happens because we don’t want to be learning after-the-fact.
I think if you hold that thought, your question may be answered in the next two speakers. Ms. Seto introduced Dennis Lopez, Safe Drinking Water Branch Chief.
The water testing to date indicate compliance with the long-term monitoring. Exceedances has predominantly been lead found in fixtures such as premise plumbing. [Mediation]Remediation response include replacement of the fixture or to take the fixture out of service. Periods 1 to 3 starting April 2023 sampled 5% of homes and buildings for each monthly period. Approximately 1,630 buildings and home locations were sampled in the first three periods adding to the already 1,000+ building and homes sampled in stage 4. Stage 5 is the long- term monitoring plan. Period 4 was completed in November 2022, approximately 1,122 buildings and home locations were sampled, and we are now in period 5 which is slated to end in May 2023 with another 1,122 buildings and homes. The LTM will run to February 2024 and we’re keeping continued vigilance on all the buildings and homes and distribution systems. As a reminder, Red Hill shaft is not part of the distribution system, that is [it is] isolated [from the distribution system]. The Navy’s Aiea Halawa shaft is currently not in use and the joint base Pearl Harbor and the consecutive system Aliamanu military reservation is being served by a single source in Waiawa. Ms. Seto introduced Fenix Grange, Hazard Evaluation Emergency Response Office.
I have been leading the environmental team, evaluating the groundwater, and doing our best to understand what’s happening in the subsurface with the previous spills and looking ahead to ensure that the Navy has done the work necessary to be ready should a spill happen. During defueling there are many efforts being overseen by our engineering folks as well as to ensure that the likelihood over these is low but nonetheless it is very important, we understand where fuel might go should that happen so that we can be prepared and protect our groundwater sources. We do that in a few ways in terms of directing the Navy to put in additional sentinel wells so that we have early warning systems to protect the Board of Water Supply wells as well as other water sources. The way the data that we [collet]collect is regular monitoring, groundwater monitoring, so they put monitoring on a very frequent basis and then we have our subject matter expert study those to understand what kinds of patterns we are seeing. The other thing that has been the responsibility of the Navy was to complete a groundwater flow model to be able to understand how the water is moving, what direction it is moving and so that helps us understand how contaminants are transported. We also require contaminant fate and transport, that’s generally how fluid spilled on the ground, into the ground, moves above the water table, but underground. With the lava flows here, fuels can get trapped in pockets in some places, but they can flow rapidly through cracks and other sorts of things like that, so we are working hard to try to understand what is happening there. The groundwater modeling efforts the Navy have done to date, we have not found satisfactory in terms of their ability to represent well data that we collect, changes in temperature, chemistry of the water and sorts of things like that so we continue to work with them on that, for now we are also very focused on additional efforts including field studies. The University of Hawai‘i received a grant from the Office of Naval Research with Don Thomas as the principal investigator so he has independent federal funding to be able to further investigate and help us with modeling. We do have a lot of data coming in and one of the questions from one of the constituents, Katherine McCallahan, she had a list of questions and to save time today I’m not going to go over them one by one, but I have them ready to send to her and I’d be happy to send them to the Commission as well. It really has to do with understanding what the long sheets of data that come from the Department that are posted on the DOH website and what they mean, etc.
I just want to confirm, are you going to be able to make that data available to the Water Commission?
The results are available on our DOH website and it’s a cumulative summary of all the data collected under our EO, May and November 2021 releases. Katherine had specific questions why there appear to be data gaps in certain areas and why sometimes the data didn’t get posted especially right after the May release samples were collected starting in May. We were not able to get our hands on the data until late in the summer and some of the data in June and July, we didn’t get until late September, so we were not able to post those in time. Again, there’s a lot of detail here and I’m happy to send both the data sheet and this information together, that might be the easiest way to understand what we are talking about, what the questions are and what our answers are.
Thanks, Fenix for the update. My understanding was that at a time when you were waiting for the Navy to hand over data and there were lags, so now DOH is taking independent sampling? Is that correct? Categorizing them separately?
We don’t do that consistently but yes, we do. We did quite a bit of that after the November release and in December and January. That also involves our field staff, observing, collecting samples, etc. Similarly, with the AFFF spill that happened recently our folks were out there watching and collecting samples as well.
Are those data back from the lab? Are they posted on the DOH website and is it in the same place? From what I remember it was sometimes hard to navigate what information was where.
We have an agreement with the Navy to produce that data so it should be posted on Friday of this week for the PFAS release and that includes data from the soil and groundwater wells.
Aurora, there’s a recognition on my behalf, our website can be difficult or unfriendly, so we are actively working on trying to make it easier to navigate.
I think I noticed that it was more organized for public access so it’s good to know it will all be accessible through that website, thank you.
Just one more note, the AFFF the laboratory they are using for the PFAS has been what we understood from talking with the Navy is it’s taking time for those data to come back as well. They have most of the first week’s data so the goal for Friday is to be able post all of the first two weeks of data that were collected. Those are the most significant, the ones they were trying to categorize or figure out where the edges of contamination were, etc.
I’m kind of the new kid on the block, is DOH the repository of data? Do you collect BWS data as well?
The BWS data belongs to them. We would certainly be delighted to have it and I think there is interest on all parties to be able to share data so we can all see what’s going on. We have acted as a repository of the Navy’s data and of our data and the Navy has it online as well. They are currently expanding their safe water site that was originally for the drinking water for neighborhoods that were affected by the spill, but they now have an environmental data section online. It is in its beginning stages but that is there as well and as Kathy mentioned we’re looking to figure out how to make access to the information and the way the information is presented in a more user-friendly way, so you don’t end up having to go through lots of different documents or search through large excel files. We are still working on that, and the Navy is doing that as well.
Essentially, you don’t have BWS data?
We do not have BWS data. We have spoken about that with them and still hope that we can get it. Every piece of data that we have about what is happening in different parts of the region especially around their wells helps model and understand what might be happening in that area and they are also similarly interested in our data.
Thank you very much.
Given this new potential AOC what does DOH feel is an optimistic timeline for defueling since you folks have been on this for a long time?
We recognize that fuel in the tanks can lead to a catastrophe, but there is also a recognition that if we defuel too quickly without critical repairs to the pipeline, it could lead to a similar catastrophe. We are trying to balance the two. We do believe the repairs to the pipeline are critical as we defuel and we’re hoping that the repairs to the pipeline will be done sometime in early 2024 and defueling subsequently. 
Completed in early 2024?
DOH and EPA are looking at any possible way that we can shorten that timeline.
Without cutting corners.
Absolutely, we don’t want another catastrophe.
Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani, we have the Navy’s latest defueling schedule as a link on our website so you can find that there. We also have a condensed timeline version that the department has compiled that was shared at our open house last week Thursday.
Would you mind screen sharing just for those watching and the public so they know that we should all go check out the website?
This is our DOH website for the Red Hill Water Information (https://health.hawaii.gov/about/red-hill-water-information/) you would go to the EO and the condensed timeline would be at this location here. This is the summary of the defueling timeline where we have the Navy’s estimate of repairs to be completed by November 7, 2023, and defueling estimated to be completed by June 24, 2024.
That’s helpful thank you for giving us a brief tour of the site.
I’m not sure if this is for Joanna or Kathy, this is forward looking as you’ve gone through the Red Hill experience you have a 900-pound gorilla sitting on top of a 1,800-pound valuable resource and from the cheap seats at 60,000 feet, it seems like the institutional knowledge of the operators of that 900-pound gorilla weren’t very good. Looking forward, can you recommend things that the Commission can look at to be more proactive rather than reactive to these situations? I recognize DOH has a certain responsibility for safe drinking water and EPA has a certain responsibility for water quality, but it seems that the Navy’s institutional knowledge and coping with the potential hazard of the fuel has been suspect in my mind where they keep turning wrong valves or getting contractors who are directed to do work.
That’s a good question, operationally the Navy has demonstrated they were not able to operate that facility safely which led to our first Emergency Order, which is why we issued that first Emergency Order. We are committed to overseeing the defueling in addition to the repairs. There are going to be drills on the defueling itself and there is going to be monitoring both by EPA, DOH and independent contractors as they defuel. Hopefully it will go as it did with the unpacking which we went through similar drills. They didn’t release any fuel at that time, and they unpacked approximately one (1) million gallons of fuel out of those pipelines and so I think if we continue to be vigilant and make them go through the steps and monitor, hopefully we can successfully defuel these tanks.
Are you recommending organizational changes to develop institutional knowledge so they can be proactive in managing the current water systems that they have responsibility for?
That’s a separate question so you’re talking about the use of their water and managing their water system.
With all the different hazards that they have, being in the military, that’s what you deal with.
I think that can be best answered by Dennis who is the Manager of the Safe Drinking Water Branch.
Are there any other situations like that where you have maybe a 400- pound gorilla sitting on a 400-pound water resource?
Generally speaking, the DOH regulates the water system provider. We would regulate BWS or the Navy, it’s up to the purveyor of that water to provide safe drinking water to its customers. The other thing is, currently the Navy is not getting its water from Red Hill shaft. They’re getting it from Waiawa Shaft which is the same shaft that we are all getting our water from. First, we need to remediate the aquifer before we can come to that determination on how they are going to regulate that water to their users, if anybody…Joanna or Dennis if you want to chime in?
I’m looking more to be in proactive mode, I don’t want to be in reactive mode.
I understand that and maybe that’s a discussion we can have as a Commission.
I think that’s the value of what we provide as CWRM, you have your job and I understand and thank goodness for that, thanks, Kathy.
I wasn’t sure if there was a response from Dennis?
I thought I was being asked to comment, I can still comment if Commissioner Katayama wants me to, if he can rephrase the question for me.
I just wondered from the lessons learned, as you’re going through this Red Hill situation, rather than being reactive to situations, what can we do to be more proactive in assuring ourselves whoever the purveyor is, has institutional knowledge to anticipate before a situation gets out of hand, where it endangers our water systems, what can we do?
When we did assist the EPA with the water system portion of the AOC proposed 2023 EPA Consent Order, we worked it with them to put together a plan to increase their capability to respond to clear the drinking water system. A couple of items that we had them put in is to have a hydraulic model which the water distribution system was lacking. During the response time it prohibited flushing techniques that they couldn’t do. Other items that we wanted them to make sure that the Navy had as part of their response is a valve maintenance program. Some of the excuses the Navy had is they didn’t want to touch certain valves and hence they couldn’t do unidirectional flushing. All the excuses that came up to us, we helped the EPA put that into the plan. We couldn’t mandate it because we had to think about all the other water systems out there and not everybody has the resources to come up with a flushing plan with a hydraulic model. But the Navy is a special situation, and with the proposed 2023 EPA[]] Consent Order it allowed us that path to assist them to improve their water system. The Navy has a lot of money that was put into their maintenance program but when the money gets there it gets pushed in different directions. They have a utility, that had in our opinion, deferred maintenance over time and we want to make sure that they’re able to respond if something happens. The threat is not only Red Hill they could have a backflow issue with all the industrial processes over there and so we’re hoping that will create the model and encourage systems to learn from this and improve their systems accordingly. We’re not a permitted driven entity, we want to bring everybody into compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act. We do provide funding through our low interest loans, the SRF Program to help the water systems deliver that clean water to their customers. However, the Navy as a federal entity cannot participate in our SRF Drinking Water State Revolving Fund funds but there’s a lot of funds out there for the rest of the 130+ systems around the islands. We also have principal forgiveness loans for the small systems that are disadvantaged so this is a great opportunity. I know I kind of diverted on my conversation, but I just want to promote that we do have a SRF program and we want to not only help the Navy, but we want to help all our public water systems.
Good to know, thank you.
My question riffs off Commissioner Katayama’s which is we didn’t have a December meeting and it would have been a good chance to think about what have we learned in the last year and what kind of institutional changes do we need to implement to function better in future potential water crises? One thing the permitted interaction group struggled with, and it seems like we’re talking more openly now, not in executive session, so that is helpful, but what is the role that the Commission plays? As you said, we need to clean up the aquifer and that has implications for how we consider our available water, if it’s contaminated, is it available at cost for cleanup? What is the role that you guys see? Couple of us know where we think the Commission should be at the table with DOH, but where does DOH see the Commission playing an important a role?
As you know, we do have a meeting with the Navy, EPA, CWRM and USGS to talk about these things, so perhaps that could be a place where all of the trustees of the resource can determine what roles we play. I think there’s going to be a meeting of the RRAPR in February.
First of all, I’d like to thank the DOH for the presentation today and for all that you’re doing in this regard. What’s challenging for me in these reports whether it’s the Navy or EPA or Department of Health, what does it mean for us? What is our kuleana here and how do we optimize our working relationship and collaboration with other agencies? Kathy if it exists, let me know if it can happen. I’d like your opinion on that as well as is there some kind of collaboration agreement amongst the agencies that identifies our shared goals, that talks about the duties of the parties and talks about how we are going to coordinate our action plans to optimize each other’s outcomes. Does that exist? Shouldn’t it?
I think that’s one of the goals of what we call the RRAPR (Red Hill Remediation & Restoration Action Plan Roundtable). One of the goals is to get all the trustees together and to work towards understanding with EPA and the Navy on remediation of the aquifer.
I think that’s essential, it’s critical for us to do our job.
Kaleo has been participating in the RRAPR.
Well it would be good to see that as we sit here and we see the actions and the duties of the parties and they coordinate a plan, then we have milestones when these reports come in we can have a discussion of what the milestone was for various agencies and their progress toward achieving that and what the variances are and then what the consequences of those variances are for our own individual efforts that are our kuleana and not yours or EPA’s or the Navy’s. So brand new year, let’s set some goals and maybe we could come up with that collaboration agreement. Second, with respect to our Commission, it seems to me and correct me if I’m not getting this and when I use the word resource, I mean freshwater resource. Our job is to protect resource quantity, to manage resource accessibility, usually that’s by giving permits to wells and so forth or in some cases taking wells offline. Third, allocate resource prudently so as this crisis unfolds it seems to me we are wanting to know are we doing all that we can and using all the tools that we have to dispatch those three key kuleana that we have. We work together with BWS and DOH - what’s the threat to this resource that we need to protect and what do we need to do? Number one, we took it offline along with the BWS so that helps to reduce the threat. With respect to resource accessibility, we’re not going to access that, we need to develop more resources, we need more well permits out there, we need to support that - what are we doing and what is the timeframe for that, what are the targets for that? Finally, as we’re allocating resources, what do we need to do to change the permits that we have outstanding? Whether it’s to the Navy or anybody else do we need to reduce people’s allocations, what do we need to do? This is not a criticism, it’s just as we look forward with excitement about how to do our jobs better in this new year. Can we get to that, where we then are having these reports and getting this information, all this detail in the context of a plan, where are targets are and where we’re on plan and where we’re ahead of plan?
I totally agree, just in trying to keep up with DOH as our sister agency on the quality side. This past year has been really trying to figure out how to best support each other in this process. The permitted interaction group started last January and wrapped up with its report in June or July, so it took us some time to figure out where we wanted to go and what we wanted to see done. I think there’s been clear guidance at least from the Commission thus far, we need to update and refresh with this new administration of where we want to go. As Governor Green said in his State of the State Address, he and his administration are committed to taking on a more active role and coordinating at the state level. Deputy Ho will be the lead and we are all going to find ways to support her through that. Just in case you didn’t get the State of the State Address, that is what he said, Deputy Ho will be the lead. We as a member of this body, it is critical that we find ways to coordinate between DOH and the Water Commission in what we do. The RRAPR was brought up, Katie Roth, Head of our Planning Branch, it is a planning function and it’s the idea of bringing together all these various plans and commitments that have been made, related to remediation of the aquifer, but also just to short term plans of defueling into one repository of information. Commissioner Buck was also a part of that RRAPR conversation so we’ve provided critique on how we can improve that and we’re working with those parties to make it the best tool that we can all work on and use. What I do see happening is we may need to develop one specifically for the Water Commission, so we don’t get gobbled up in the larger kuleana of remediation. We have our specific goals and metrics that we want to see accomplished so that’s something I’m committed to. You will see more data and more information coming back to the Commission and my commitment is to hold space on Red Hill with this body because it is complicated, it is complex, there’s a lot of information that needs to be shared. Having something to report to you every month, I think like you mentioned, is going to be helpful to see forward progress and not a bunch of running in circles on this issue.
I certainly appreciate the Governor’s confidence in Kathy and the department and support that. We want to be a member of the team, but we have an important responsibility in and of ourselves for managing this vital resource and it seems to me it helps her do her job as well as help us do our job if we really have a clear understanding of what our needs are to make the decisions we need to make about this resource. Let’s lock that in and then you’re informed and with that you’re able to carry that to the meetings that you have with all the other agencies.
I appreciate that and if I could just chime in, I think as Kathy mentioned if this RRAPR meeting is going to occur in February, perhaps the next meeting we can have a real good hard conversation whether that is in executive session or open session. This is what I’ve been telling our DLNR divisions, our kuleana is hard enough as it is so I’m about staying in our lane, but I want to know what our lane is too. Likewise, with the Water Commission, coming back on what Commissioner Hannahs is talking about, I think we need to be very clear so that when our representative sits on that meeting, they’re advocating a clear message from where we see our kuleana to be. Kaleo will schedule that for our next meeting, and if we need a special meeting or something in preparation for that just to empower you with a clear message from the commission. Clearly, I need to get up to speed so you and I can talk story about outcomes and where we need to go forward.
I have one last portion of the website to share. This is on the Red Hill Shaft filtration and discharge into Hālawa Stream. This is the last section of the table, and it provides you with a Red Hill weekly operations report for the discharge that is going through the GAC system and into Hālawa Stream. The report of January 8-14 says that they have been averaging a discharge of 4.23 mgd per day. There have been 42 samples taken per week for influent and effluent and all the result have been non-detect. That is all I have for the report that we are giving today.
I greatly appreciate DOH’s comprehensive update to the Water Commission.
Thank you so much for having me, my family and I were guests of the island during the contamination at Red Hill, I wanted to come today and I’ve appreciated just listening to the Commission’s role and if you’ll bear with me just ever so slightly off of the questions that Fenix already said she would offline discuss with me based on some of the data Commissioner Katayama commented about being proactive versus reactive. Our families really experienced that the down side of being reactive if you look at the future of O‘ahu’s aquifer, your public health, your environment, I think what Commissioner Katayama was saying is indeed the focus. Couple of my questions still have to do with that. One of the main ones is for the Department of Health, when did you receive groundwater sampling data for the May 2021, June 2021, July 2021 dates? I’ll leave the remainder of the question but it kind of has to do with that answer.
I did have a chance to go through your questions. The first data over that summer we did not get data from the Navy for a long time, so we didn’t get what was going on. I think our first data we received was in August 2021, so the release was made in May, it took a while to get sampling under way, etc. Then the July data we didn’t receive until the end of September and the Navy reported that the labs were backed up and it was just taking a very long time. We didn’t get those data until later and then things had already happened and eventually some effects, the ripple effect. 
Is that a common practice that the DOH struggles with, to receive data that you’re expecting to receive from the Navy? Groundwater sampling data, has that been a pattern, a history there?
We have had some continuing issues with that, yes, partly some of it had to do with simply the volume of samples that were coming in. One of the things that is very important to us is as soon as they do get access to the data, we need to see it right away.
I guess I’ll leave it with this, to your Commission and just focusing on the future of your aquifer. Just as a resident, that to me, is a problem that we have all experienced and if somebody has the magic answer to being able to provide your Commission, families, the public, data in a timely manner, is there some force of consequence for public notice that can go out when data is delayed by default? I feel like in the future, for your aquifer and your protections if every time the Navy has something of concern, and they just decide to not give you the data, what are your recourses? Maybe getting the Governor involved to have a stronger force to come back and alert the public and the purveyor who is delinquent in getting the information. I appreciate all your work. I wish you all a wonderful and healthy future aquifer. My family and I have moved off now but we are going to continue fighting for the future for our loving friends and family on O‘ahu and for your future aquifer. I’ll take offline conversation with Fenix, I appreciate it.
Lots of interesting conversation and lots of catching up from December. I will go through my questions. I don’t know if you saw them ahead of time. I also provided seven attachments you can look at later. I’m not going to digress from my questions. I’m going to start with environmental action levels, and I have questions, but I don’t know if they can be answered. Using a plume degradation scenario, non-degrade JP-5, action levels are currently at 266 ug/l. When posed with this question of how a sample indicating a 265 would be described as non-detect, I’m not sure why I could not get an answer yesterday. Say you’re in your house and you get your sample report back and highest action level is 266 and you get a finding of 265, would you feel comfortable having an only one-unit difference between being called it’s detected or non-detected? Mr. Brewer explained how the number is determined. Mind you at the December 15, 2022, BWS meeting, he said his spreadsheet had an error and he had to recalculate. He also explained how he is a risk assessor not a toxicologist. He says he solicits information from many sources, which is great, but in the most recent publication by the Department of Health, there are updated environmental action levels with strict calculation models for EALs. Did you use that model to develop the spreadsheet? In my questions I’m also asking for your credentials, exactly how are EAL levels decided, by whom, give us the names. Does that make you feel confident that his spreadsheet doesn’t have any more errors? Next on my agenda is sampling. During the actual sampling, Department of Health used several lower incident specific levels 300, 200 and 211. The Department of Health still hasn’t clearly explained to the public why that was, so my question is why? Upon review of the online sampling reports, it appears that any sample of TPH-g,o,d that fell below the incident specific level was determined as “non detect,” leading customers to believe their drinking water was clear of any fuel, which is not true. If a sample is collected, using the incident specific level of 200 and the sample is 199, 199 will be notated as “non detect” and not 199. Lastly, is the Department of Health and the EPA and the consent order. The thing I wanted to say and maybe a question Ms. Ho can think about, is what regulatory authority would you be giving up or the state be giving up if you partnered with the EPA on this consent order? Although I have heard you several times say that you’re going to stick with the 2015 Emergency Order, which I plan to go over tonight to compare it with the Consent Order to see what’s the big deal. What power is this that you’re trying to give up? We’re talking about the amount of water that is going from Red Hill Shaft into the Hālawa Stream. At the meeting yesterday we talked about when was the last time that fuel was detected at the Red Hill Shaft discharging millions of gallons into Hālawa Stream? There probably was a date but they have not found or determined whether all this water going into Hālawa Stream is beneficial or not but after 14 months of doing this and wasting our water, wouldn’t it be nice to know? Dennis, I appreciate your understanding of unidirectional flushing and hydraulic models and the valves. The Navy is not understanding of this and if you provide any information to them to keep them on track for the long-term monitoring project to go on, the public will send you flowers. Thank you very much.
This is public testimony. I guess it is at the option of DOH to respond but they are not required to provide a response in this forum. I just wanted to say that.
Thank you for that, I think what we’d like to do is, there were so many questions, could we respond to her questions in writing? Is it different questions than what we received yesterday? If we put it up on our website is that the best way to respond?
Yes, they are somewhat different.
Ms. Picola-Davis, if you could forward those to DOH and then DOH if you could just make sure we get a copy of whatever the public response is. I would agree with Deputy Attorney General Julie China, this is public testimony but not intended to be a forum where DOH is required to answer.
I know that they are not required to answer nor was I expecting them to. I was just sharing my questions as a person of the public. I appreciate all the work that you do. These questions have been emailed to DLNR for today’s meeting and if Kathleen wants me to forward that email, I can. Kathleen you are not obliged to answer the questions, I understand that. If you choose to do that, I would appreciate it, but I know that you are a busy woman.
I really want to express appreciation for the hard work that the Commission, Commission staff, the Department of Health and their staff have been doing over the last 18 months to address this crisis. I wanted to highlight three problems. First, I appreciate that there was swift action needed to prevent the spread of AFFF concentrate after the 1,300 gallons were spilled last year. I think I have deep concerns about the capping, and it wasn’t only the capping but the backfilling over excavated areas which essentially means it is going to be very difficult to re-excavate if necessary. I’m not sure if the DOH was able to conduct an assessment, where the soil samples were taken, if they were able to take their own samples and have independent objective testing or if we are just relying on the Navy to indicate whether they were able to clean up their own mess. Also, the facility is porous right? A tremendous amount of concentrate was released in the facility, and we know that rainwater infiltrates continually. The concrete floor is also not watertight and there is also concern about what is going on in the inside - it may be difficult to assess the remediation efforts. Also looming is the fact that they are going to continue using potentially AFFF. They need some kind of fire protection capability within the facility. I think it is important that we to keep the pressure up to ensure that they don’t continue holding these forever chemicals just 100 feet above our groundwater aquifer. The chemicals are tremendously toxic parts per quadrillion - for PFOA I think that’s one drop in a thousand Olympic-sized swimming pools that could render this water unsafe under the EPA’s interim advisory guidelines. The second problem is the drinking water system that is not just the Navy but also civilian housing. I really appreciate there were multiple attempts to refine the water testing process that has been going on, but we know from the September 2022 CDC/ATSDR survey that there are almost 300 people that continue to report seeing sheens in their water as well as almost 800 people continue to have health effects. I want to urge continued thinking, regarding what might be the cause of the discrepancies. We can’t just dismiss one dataset because another dataset says the water is fine. There are folks moving into these housing units who really don’t have much informed consent to determine what their risk is should they decide to use their tap water for domestic use and consumption. We know there are many other issues with the water systems, there could be other things in there both in jet fuel which isn’t just pure TPH-d but could include antimicrobial, antifreeze chemicals as well as just issues with their water systems - as we know from the EPA’s investigation has not been operated and still isn’t being operated in compliance with safety water regulations. The third problem/issue is the need to be hypervigilant about the Navy’s water use. We just heard that they are dumping on an average 4.3 million gallons per day, multiply that by 360 days you get over 1.5 billion gallons. This Commission has been urging them for over a year now to start planning on some kind of alternative reuse of some of that water so we’re not wasting our most precious resource. There’s been discussions about evaluating the Navy’s water uses under their water use permits issued by the Commission. I do want to urge that you do take some bolder positions. I know the tendency is to be conservative about the state’s authority when it comes to the federal government, but we do have a gray area where now is the time to be assertive. If you’re going to assert an aggressive position, this is it. If it’s not now, I don’t know when that would be so to get a quick ask of you folks of the Commission members and basically everyone listening, this EPA consent decree does provide an opportunity for us to get provisions and concrete mechanisms and proactive tools that can avoid the issues with the 2015 Administrative Order and Consent which the non-enforcement have led the exacerbation of this crisis. For your Commission members in your individual capacity, your comments as trustees of our public trust, as guardians of our most precious resource will carry weight even if it is in your individual capacity. I have three basic talking points that you might want to raise or that I’d like to respectfully urge you to raise if you do choose to reach out. One is we need concrete deadlines, there’s no deadlines in the consent decree and the deadlines aren't something to be afraid of. The Navy’s pipeline repair is going to be done by November. Ask for a deadline for August, which I think is within the realm of possibility by talking to the EPA if they miss the deadline. It doesn’t mean you just let it go, you can have an order to show cause, you can have the Navy come forward and explain what kind of extenuating circumstances may have caused them to miss the deadline. It’s not like you’re going to force them to let it rip and endanger but at least you’ll have something there so the Navy knows they’ll have to identify any excuses or justifications they may have. That way we have some safeguards against some of the foot- dragging we’ve seen. Advocate for concrete deadlines where you can check on the Navy’s progress, urge the Navy not to use P5 concentrates because we don’t want another spill to push us past the point of no return and we need on-island testing. I’m happy to talk to any folks offline about these ideas and if you have any questions. Thank you for your time and attention.
I’m from Hālawa Valley and I’ve been testifying at every board meeting since last January. I just want you to know exactly what I said last January. You are going to have meeting, after meeting, after meeting, everyone is super polite and here we go one year later. We are that much closer to another leak. My positive suggestion for Commissioner Katayama, Commissioner Hannahs, for everyone on this board, was to ask for a blow-by-blow accounting of the leaks that have happened so far. How those mistakes have been incorporated and how the defueling, blow-by-blow, minute by minute, is really going to go down from the mouths of the actual engineers. This is a major surgery from which we, the people, who will be living with the after-effects. If it is a botched surgery because we weren’t looking at the details enough, it’s going to be catastrophic. If we know anything from the past leaks, it’s not about the tanks, it really wasn’t about the pipes, it was about the humans and the system, just like Commissioner Katayama pointed out. This series of exercises of dissecting what is the plan, we need that, I would like to ask this Commission to write a letter to be in support of this with a timeline of this month. I would like independent engineers from our community other than the Navy to weigh in and talk about these details. It may take a series of at least 10 times if you ask me, but let’s just have one this month. That’s my proposal and I agree with everyone prior, and I would like to ask you two things. Can you also see yesterday’s BWS meeting? It’s going to be online you’ll see the testimonies of people there in combination with what the Department of Health and the EPA were saying. I think it’s a must see along with the movie Dark Waters, that will explain to us what we are facing with our aquifers with respect to the forever chemicals. Thank you for your time.
Thank you so much Department of Health for your presentation and your updates and participation in our meeting. Thank you, Joanna, thank you so much for your team, thank you Kathy.
