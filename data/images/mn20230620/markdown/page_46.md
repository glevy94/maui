MS. RIVERA: Perhaps I could --

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: I guess, is it leaving the site?

MS. ONO: Excavating. This is Kristi Ono with the County of Maui Department of Public Works. Given the concern, I'm sure within the area, we could find a use for that material, and it does not need to leave the site.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Yeah, it's not a lot. It's only 600 yards. So the plan is that you will reuse it somewhere backfilling in that area to address Forestry's concern?

MS. ONO: Yes. If it's not appropriate material to reuse specifically for this project, I'm sure within the area of the Wailuku River, we can find a use for it as there are, you know, maintenance practices done nearby that could likely use material.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Okay, good. Thank you.

CHAIR CHANG: Any other questions or comments?

(No response.)

CHAIR CHANG: Do I have any -- those are the only people on the list. Do I have any other -- Kathy, anybody else on the Zoom that is here to provide comments on Item B-2?

MS. YODA: No.

CHAIR CHANG: Okay. Hearing no other comments, do I have a motion on this matter?
