PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Deputy Director Dean Uyeno
Staff stated the summary of request which is to approve SDWP.6001.2 in accordance with the Waimea Watershed Agreement.
Good morning again, Chair, members of the Commission. Maybe what I’ll do is we did submit testimony as well but maybe I’ll try to preemptively answer some of the questions and maybe related to some of the discussion in the last item. We definitely take to heart the point about we engaged in the mediation process, and we signed off on a plan. One of the challenges we ran into early on in that process was sort of this fork in the road question on, well what happens in phase one if phase one is all that happens permanently and what happens if you have phase one and then it’s transitioning quickly into phase two. From our perspective it was apparent that you would at least need an entirely different set of considerations in a phase one standalone scenario versus a phase one as a transitional to phase two. Then it became a question to us, and did we feel it was reasonable to demand that two separate phase one plans were fully engineered and permitted. The reason you would have had to do that in parallel was because of the lengthy time period that we did actually see realized in getting Army Corps and all the other necessary approvals. You had to pick what you thought was the most likely scenario and run that down to ground and it wasn’t feasible to say, well we have to keep in mind that if the less likely scenario ends up being realized we need to continue to do all of the work required to potentially implement that alternate universe instead of the one in which we all thought at the time the energy project would move forward. That’s not to say that maybe we made a mistake in taking that approach. I’m not saying that we necessarily made the right decision at the time but that was our thought process. We didn’t foresee that as a possibility, it’s that at a ground level what would it take to actually say, well if we really didn’t do phase two then what would you do that would be an entirely different and significant set of work engineering, permitting, etc. that in all likelihood if we went to Army Corps with two different plans they would say figure out which one you’re going to do and then come back and we’ll permit that one. There was a logistical hurdle to that idealized concept of, well we’ve got a standalone thing if we don’t do phase two and we’ve got a plan if we do phase two. We had to run with the more likely option at the time, at least that was our perspective.
Commissioners, any questions for Joshua?
I want to ask a more implementation question. If we approve a stream diversion permit it has to start work within what a year?
No, the permit’s good for two years.
Okay, so if we approve a permit and they don’t do anything then it expires?
If we don’t approve a permit, they can’t do anything?
And that’s what got us here is they had a permit, but they didn’t do anything.
Correct. The only issue may be that if there were concerns about the actions that they’re applying for, if there are issues with how they’re doing the construction at certain diversions.
My point is that if you don’t give them a permit, there’s no incentive for people to come to some conclusion. If you give them a permit then they got to do something and I’m not talking about the applicant, I’m talking about people, the applicant and people who are concerned about their permit. I don’t want to get stuck in foreverland forever. I’d like to force the issue.
Elena Bryant on behalf of Earthjustice. As I stated in my earlier testimony on B1 the mediation agreement required basic structural modifications to be done to ensure that stream flow would be restored to the maximum extent possible and to ensure connectivity and a wetted path for which stream life could traverse. For Waiakōali the dam there diverts all stream flow, completely dewatering the stream below unless a heavy rainfall event allows some of the flows to over top the dam. At the hydrologist meeting that was alluded to by previous testifiers on B1 there’s no modifications proposed for Waiakōali to ensure stream flow restoration, let alone connectivity. For Kawaikōī and Kauaikinana, planning boards remain in the ditch that prevent stream flow restoration to the maximum extent possible and the proposal set forth by KAA do have incremental improvements by moving boards up but not out. Again, this still doesn’t comply with the spread of the agreement. None of KAA’s concerns or DHHL’s concerns were ever brought to our attention, ADC claimed they were aware of these on November 7th. They weren’t shared at the January compliance meeting two weeks ago with Earthjustice or our clients. DHHL states they were made aware of this on Friday. Same thing, nothing was ever brought to our attention, so we do stand by the terms of the mediation agreement and the commitments that each party to the agreement made and ask this Commission to approve staff recommendation. If the Commission is inclined to defer, we would ask that this be placed on the agenda for the next meeting to ensure that the parties are in fact communicating and engaging in good faith discussions to meet the commitments in the agreement that were agreed upon seven years ago. Thank you and I’m available for any questions.
Good morning, Chair, good morning, members. Essentially, the same summary as before. We stand on our written testimony on this. Our main concern is making sure that DHHL and our users are able to receive the appropriate amount of water. If the analysis proves accurate, which it looks like it will, we’re just concerned about making sure that the users have the appropriate amounts of water.
Lyle, if I can ask you when you say the analysis, you’re relying upon Basil Gomez’s analysis?
Did you just hear his testimony that the same data was presented in 2015?
Yeah, I wasn’t here at the time, and I wasn’t aware of that, so for our purposes and admittedly we’ve had some turnover in this office, I became aware of this on the 7th.
Hi Lyle, this is Wayne Katayama. Are there any reservations for not renewing KIUC’s license or right of access to the site?
There is on our part at least until we know we have a holistic view of what this project is going to look like both in terms and I guess when I say that I’m referring to the old scope, the West Kauaʻi Energy Project, the hydro portion has been eliminated. For our parts we want to know what the new project is going to look like before we make any approvals. I think we just want to make sure we don’t piecemeal things and perhaps have an idea of what’s happening over here, but we don’t have a firm idea of what’s happening over here. We’d like a holistic view of what the project changes are and what the amended scope will look like.
I’d just like to make a comment about I’ve heard several times about we want to assure that our people get the water. There are no absolutes in these streams, we’re talking about stream restoration and off-stream uses. One does not trump the other completely so if there has to be a balance, part of that balance is that everybody doesn’t get everything they want. That’s my only comment on this.
Good morning again, Commissioners. For the record Dr. Jonathan Likeke Scheuer for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. I appreciated the comments and questions on the all the testimony given and the comments and questions from the Commissioners during B1. I want to add first a little bit of additional information that I alluded to. We have long-term plans for a small portion of our 15,000 acres of land, particularly the lands around Puʻuʻōpae, about 300 acres of lands have been issued by license to a homestead association and they are currently farming on those lands. In addition, for decades we have had five homestead lots at the very mauka portion of our lands and three of those lots are occupied by a homesteader who ranches on those lands. They receive water now from the ditch system coming from Puʻuloa Reservoir through the Puʻumoe divide. It’s fairly inefficient because it’s an unlined old irrigation ditch and one of our motivations for participating in the agreement was the promise that we would be able to get this water piped to our providing us and the Water Commission a much better way to balance instream and off-stream uses, you minimizing stream losses. We were surprised at the assertions shared with us on Friday and then Monday that this implementation of B2 could result in a lack of delivery of water to our lands. We haven’t had a chance as I said to independently verify it. I absolutely share with everybody including Earthjustice’s attorney and the Commissioners a frustration at we’ve been working for something for so long and hey at the last second, we’re asking for you to hold the breaks on it. I want to point out that DHHL has actually continued to do its part in the implementation of the Waimea Mediation Agreement in good faith, including spending hundreds of thousands of dollars going through an environmental assessment process for what homesteading would look like around Puʻuʻōpae. We also issued that went through the entire beneficiary consultation process, issued a long-term lease to KIUC for access to our lands for their portion of the project. We’ve continued to participate all along. The concern that I have at this moment on behalf of DHHL is I don’t know whether or not this implementation of these diversion changes which are required under the agreement would result in the failure to be able to deliver water six months of the year to our tenants. If that’s the case, we obviously have a very significant concern. That’s on the fly where we’re at with this submittal. Happy to answer any questions.
Jonathan, did you hear the prior testimony of Mr. Gomez that that data was old data from 2015 and that the parties knew that in 2017 when they executed the mediation settlement agreement. So why would it be a surprise that there’d be periods of time when less water was in the system and available to its users.
Thank you, Commissioner Hannahs, I did hear the testimony of Mr. Gomez. I was not the lead for DHHL during the mediation agreement so I can only represent what I had as a consultant supporting the leads for the Department. I apologize if I get some of this slightly incorrect, but this is my understanding. As the agreement was planning to move forward, operational control of the system was going to transition from KAA, ADC to KIUC. We repeatedly spoke with KIUC as the West Kauaʻi Energy Project was moving forward about how we would continue to be able to assure delivery of water to our homesteaders and homestead tenants during all phases of the project. When KIUC was involved with the entirety of the project through phase one to phase two, we had those assurances. They were very clear, yes and it was actually in our lease agreement with KIUC. Now, as it appears it might go KIUC’s obligation under the Waimea Mediation Agreement ends with their implementation of these phase one diversions and so the operator would now not become KIUC but would instead remain KAA and ADC. We have no assurances from them that they’re going to be able to continue to do that. In fact, what we’ve been orally conveyed is the exact opposite, so yes, the data existed, we relied on the assurances from KIUC that during all phases we’d be able to deliver water. I don’t know what they base that on in terms of their analysis of the data that was at hand. Is that responsive to your question, Commissioner?
It’s complicated, thank you.
Which is why respectfully and if there was an after analysis of everything that’s gone on, there is abundant blame to cast in many directions. But there’s so much context to this, this is why my initial suggestion was a briefing on the agreement as a whole as well as the current status of the West Kauaʻi Energy Project would allow the Water Commission to make a decision where it sees the relationship between the parts and the whole.
But rest assured I for one was not casting a lot of blame and finding people to point fingers at but just resolve this as best we can and honor the agreements that we have but also make sensible accommodation when things are different. Dean, correct me if I’m wrong but I appreciate Josh’s testimony on this issue that there’s a material difference, you have an agreement. One is about putting gages out there to give you more information, that hasn’t changed too much. Even though this part of phase one was separated from the commitment of the phase two creation of the utility system, these are material changes in the infrastructure that require permits and approvals not only by us but from Corps of Engineers and so forth. You might want to do it differently knowing that you’re not going to have the phase two that you thought you had back in 2017. I’m sympathetic to that, that’s a little bit different from gages.
In these cases, because the water and anybody can correct me if I’m wrong, but because the water is going through the hydro system and being returned to the stream, the ditches are being treated as streams in this case per the Army Corps jurisdiction.
This is your application and your application was based upon a particular project, is that correct?
The application before you today is for designs that were created to implement the phase one IIFS whether or not the West Kauaʻi Energy Project went forward. As we understood it our commitment was to make sure that those modifications when in place, the phase one IIFS could be implemented by the ditch operator regardless of what happened with the West Kauaʻi Energy Project. That’s what’s in the application.
For me I will always talk about what’s my lane and in this case my lane is IIFS. It’s to ensure that that’s been met and what I’m hearing you say is that this application even though it is more than just gages, it’s intended to meet the IIFS. Is that correct?
It’s intended to allow the ditch operator to implement the IIFS, yes. Clarification, implement the IIFS at the point of diversion. In other words the IIFS stays in the stream rather than go into the ditch and then return. That was what we were tasked with doing in our commitment for the phase one as we understood it.
Thank you, Chair for that focus. Dean, back to you. Do you agree given that there’s not going to be a phase two at this point this is the best way to achieve the IIFS objectives that we have? Would you like time to think about it? Some people are asking for deferral and so forth.
At its face it’ll implement the instream flow standards as per the agreement; however, with all due respect I think our lane is also to make sure that the diversions are installed responsibly and for the purpose that its intended, right? I recognize that there may be, given that phase two may not move forward, there may be concerns about how the diversions are constructed or modified to meet the instream flow standards. I can understand that there is some concerns by KAA and ADC to modify those plans to fit their needs as they move forward in managing the system.
No, and I appreciate that. I think that that is fair. I know that there are others still that have signed up, but does CWRM have a recommendation based upon what you’re hearing? Do you want to hear other testimony because that’s ultimately going to be my question.
I mean most of the others are in association with the agencies.
I have a question. I assume that the IIFS was reached by the usual balancing of instream and off-stream uses and if that’s the case what now comes up is that some of the off-stream uses might be affected beyond what the agreement was that sets the IIFS, is that right? Like what Jonathan was concerned about that some of the off- stream users may not get the water that they thought they would be getting. If that’s the case, shouldn’t they be trying to petition to modify the IIFS and if that’s the case, why should we wait for that to come forward when we already have an agreement on what the IIFS should be? There’s always going to be uncertainty about how much water is going to be available so I don’t see why, at least from my point of view, we have to revisit this issue all over again.
As far as the instream flow standards go?
Dawn, may I ask a question? As part of ADC’s testimony they attached what looks like a press release. Have you seen that as Exhibit A?
I have seen the press release, yes.         
One of the impacts, there were three listed, the third was the water delivery of water for irrigation and other purposes to users along the ditch of which one of them was DHHL, is that correct?
That was delivery of water through the energy project, not the phase one modification.
I think we’re on phase two, B2 now. CHAIR CHANG: We’re on B2 but I think it’s different than phase one.
Phase one was to implement the instream flow standards as quickly as possible, phase two was...
Does that change the impact of your water or water availability for DHHL?
No, the phase one modifications are flexible meaning different volumes can be diverted into the ditch. The press release is specific to the energy project which would have delivered all of DHHL’s water reservation actually but would have involved different modifications at the diversions. But the application in front of you is for the phase one IIFS modifications to implement the phase one IIFS and there’s flexibility in the modifications to vary the diversion volumes.
To meet the six million that Jonathan stated earlier?
The modifications themselves they would not prohibit diverting six million gallons of water.
But at that point you won’t be the operator? DAWN HUFF, KIUC: We would not be the operator, correct.
Dean, do the concerns that are being raised apply equally to all three streams that you’re talking about here or are we isolating one of them or two of them that are problematic and the other’s okay?
I’m not certain, I would ask that of the stakeholders.
I guess the issue I’m having here is that the applicant is making representations for somebody else and to the extent that the operator can’t remedy the situation, what’s the recourse here especially to users like DHHL? I understand how the parties need to be coherent; however, there’s a definite bifurcation once KIUC is done with their application and you have a third party that is given the keys to the car which might be great or not.
That’s a valid point. What troubles me a little is that some of this is speculation. If some of what I heard from Lyle was the reliance on Mr. Gomez’s analysis but his analysis was available over 10 years ago or about 10 years ago. What appears to be the major change circumstance is KIUC is no longer going to do their large project. I do appreciate your point.
Call upon your attorney background, do principles of attornment apply here that when somebody passes on an asset or the obligations go with them?
That kind of depends upon what the agreement is.
If I buy a piece of land that’s under lease I have to honor the lease.
But to me underlying all of that is the IIFS. It doesn’t matter who’s the operator, it doesn’t matter. That is the guiding principle.
DHHL has interest in this as well.
I see Jonathan’s hand is up, we’re having a free flow conversation. Don’t apologize, I think this is helpful.
Thank you very much, Chair. Just to make two very brief points in this conversation, the first is I think the difference between the consideration of...I’m trying to respond to Dr. Miike’s point that wouldn’t it just be our obligation if there’s now not enough water to amend the instream flow standards. Hawaiʻi’s courts have been really clear that there are four public trust uses of water, instream uses are one of them, DHHL is another, that there’s not a priority among them. My concern is that if sticking to the previously agreed to IIFS which may, we’re being told by one party our system operator, may not allow for meeting their deliveries to us. You end up privileging one public trust use over another rather than holding them without one priority even trying to satisfy all of them. I just wanted to throw that out for your conversation to consider that if you burden DHHL with having to petition to amend the instream flow standards to provide for our needs then you are fundamentally placing the burden entirely on one public trust user against other public trust uses. The second thing I wanted to just share was that I am frustrated by this whole process, I had no desire to show up this morning but again we have beneficiaries who are relying on this water now who in some cases have been relying on this water for decades. It’s just super concerning to us and we have a, I believe, fiduciary obligation. If somebody, our system operator is coming to us and saying, hey we won’t have enough water for you, we at least need to speak up in the process.
Let me respond to what Jonathan said. I am assuming that one sets up the IIFS, the opposing uses including instream flows have been considered and so it is not preferring one public trust use over the other. That balancing act should have taken place in the IIFS. If in the implementation of the IIFS it turns out that the assumptions that went into the IIFS are flawed then the burden falls upon the person who thinks they’ve been harmed to apply for modification of the IIFS. My basic point is that this does not favor one public trust use over the other. That act was balanced in the past however flawed that was and the remedy is to come back and say, I want to apply for a change in IIFS because the past one is not right.
Jonathan, do the concerns of DHHL apply to all three streams that are in this report?
I apologize, I’m not able to give a satisfactory answer due in part to the very short fuse that we were given to respond to the concerns raised to us.
Dean, do you know?
All three streams would contribute to the Kōkeʻe Ditch system which...
Goes to DHHL.
If I may real fast, let me just modify that last statement. Kōkeʻe Stream, it was proposed to return all stream flow and so the proposal here is to install a 24-inch diameter HDPE pipe. There would be no diversion from Kōkeʻe Stream contributing to Kōkeʻe Ditch if this were to proceed as presented.
If we found the other two streams to be kind of problematic, we could still amend this submittal to approve the actions for Kōkeʻe which is undisputed.
Sorry, repeat that?
If Kōkeʻe was meant to be under the agreement to be fully restored without diversion then the discussions about farmers not getting water do not apply to that stream.
In the event and I’m not sure we want to but in the event that we want to have further discussion about the other two streams, we could take action today on Kōkeʻe without dispute?
It’d just be amending that to say, approve three but not one or two or approve two and three.
Thank you, Commissioner. I guess that would be a good example of some of the concerns we have. I don’t think we’re concerned about trying to collect water from Kōkeʻe, but when we look at the long-term maintainability and reliability of the system our concern with that particular flume modification is that we believe it would get actually washed up during a heavy rain. If the system is modified for that flume to cross Kōkeʻe Stream and it gets washed out, it’s going to disrupt the service for a while and we haven’t done the work to figure out how frequent would that kind of flash flood event occur, how quickly could we replace a flume like that if it got washed down the canyon, is the remainder of the system post that modification such that we could affect a temporary fix to allow water to continue in the ditch system even if the flume itself is washed away? That’s a good example, when we’re evaluating it’s not necessarily about the IIFS, it’s also about is the system maintainable and reliably operable, separate, and apart from the IIFS.
I want to just follow, Wayne Katayama raised the issue of KIUC, they’re going to transfer, you’ll become the water purveyor. What better understanding do you need because you’re asking for a deferral of this matter is that correct?
I think we asked for denial but would be perfectly happy with that deferral.
You were asking for denial, okay.
I think we’d be fine with the deferral. Maybe to back up a step, I think we can come to a discussion and agree on a set of changes that should be acceptable. What we probably want to do probably would cost less actually to implement than what KIUC’s plans are but we just needed to be able to sit down and understand what the requirements are at this point and figure that out.
Listening to this there’s a lot of discussion and uncertainty hinging on a report that many parties including CWRM staff haven’t had time to really evaluate in light of this changing of the operator and the eventual operators comfort with the design. It is our duty to uphold the IFS and enforce these matters but I think in the spirit of trying to support a design that sits with the multiple parties and their multiple concerns, if I can make a motion to provide the parties that time and to come back before us, including having our staff look at this report that was from 2015. A major concern I have if is if it was written in 2015 and then decisions were made in 2017 and an approval was granted in 2020, maybe this is for Mr. Uyehara. Was that recent report updated to reflect those sort of design decisions or is there a new version or are we just looking at a report from 2015 that’s been unearthed?
I think I can answer that question for KAA’s part. There are several steps removed from the hydrological analysis underpinning a lot of our conclusions and the ramifications of the different changes that are being decided. A good example, I think the analysis shows that you cannot actually meet the IIFS for significant portions of the year because there’s just not that much water in the stream to begin with, but if you have Puʻulua Reservoir online, you mediate the flow to end users by use of the reservoir right. The final answer on do the end users at, for example DHHL have reliable access to water depends on all these intermediate factors that are separate from just what the IIFS number is and that can include how reliable is the delivery of water in that system when it’s available, what storage capacity is on the system to tide you over for dry periods. All of those answers sort of hinge on what actually happened with the project. Then to the basic point I think Jonathan made earlier. If a party says, look if we’re in charge of it and we build our infrastructure you will have water, that’s our commitment. Whatever reservations you have at that point if that’s their commitment to make, you can decide to if you want to take that forward. That’s sort of a different way to approach the problem which is what I think he stated was their approach.
Let me get some clarification then. I thought I heard that Kōkeʻe Stream would not be diverted and that’s the point. If it’s not diverted and it still is not having any water at certain times of the year, that’s a natural state. To say that the IIFS has to be a certain amount at a particular point but reflecting an undiverted stream, those are opposite conclusions. The point is that it should be a natural flow of Kōkeʻe Stream, not a specific amount of water at a particular place. I don’t understand why if it’s going to be an undiverted stream, water has to be added to it to reach an IIFS.
Everybody’s head is down, nobody wants to answer that question.
If that’s the case then I don’t see how it’s going to be affecting off-stream users if Kōkeʻe is to return to a natural state. The other way it would affect off-stream users is if their water is artificially put into Kōkeʻe Stream drawing it from either the ditch or someplace else.
I think in the case of Kōkeʻe, correct me if I’m wrong but it was the infrastructure issues there on that stream that if it were to be implemented as designed and proposed in application there may be concerns about it getting washed out at high flows.
What is getting washed out? Isn’t that separate from the issue about restoring Kōkeʻe to its natural state?
Right now the diversion is instream so they need to create some way to bypass the stream from the ditch. The ditch flows into Kōkeʻe Stream and then is collected on the other side. In order to bypass that collection system they need to construct some type of flume or pipeline to carry the ditch over and across the stream. So in this case I think the issue that Joshua brought up was only infrastructure-wise as far as future maintenance and concerns about high flows. In other case, I think what he brought up as far as meeting the off-stream needs pertains to the other three streams Kauaikinana, Kawaikōī, and Waiakōali.
I don’t understand it, now the place that will be washed out is where the Kōkeʻe Stream water goes back into the ditch, right?
What’s the point if you restore Kōkeʻe Stream to its natural state but in that segment between where the ditch goes in and comes out it’s higher than the natural state. If you take out the amount of water going in from the ditch and carrying it out, flowing down how is that going to affect the IFS? There’s no requirement that it has to be the same through the entire stream. Nothing’s even being taken out.
If you look at page 10 on the submittal, the ditch enters the Kōkeʻe...I can share my screen. Kōkeʻe Ditch enters Kōkeʻe Stream on the left bank of the stream. There’s a dam and a spillway here that would typically have stop logs or planning boards in it to back up the water into this area of the stream. The stream is flowing mauka to makai and would flow across the dam or through the spillway and to ensure that no water is collected from Kōkeʻe Stream the application proposes to install a 24-inch HDPE pipe across the stream channel. I think there were a couple supports that would be located on the edge of the stream channel and then it would continue to flow into Kōkeʻe Ditch on the right bank. That’s the type of concern that Mr. Uyehara raised as far as its design and ensuring that it it’s able to stand up to high flows and other future maintenance concerns.
Dean, and maybe Jonathan was correct it might be a little too late that we should have considered having a briefing, the watershed agreement, the changed circumstance of KIUC. I’m trying to understand that KIUC has determined that they’re not going to do their hydro project. Does that now mean that KAA is now going to operate the system, not KIUC.
We’re not privy to those discussions between KIUC and their process moving forward.
I think Mr. Katayama raises a point that if we’re going to have a new provider that may be saddled with something that somebody else puts in, maybe they need to have the opportunity to review everything.
I just wanted to respond to your question, KIUC is not the ditch operator now. We would have only become the ditch operator if the West Kauaʻi Energy Project had moved forward, and we would not be the ditch operator. There’s no longer a consideration for KIUC to become the ditch operator now that KIUC is not taking over Kōkeʻe Ditch and doing the hydro.
My understanding based upon your clarification is KAA is the current operator.
Under the KIUC proposed project that would have been transferred to KIUC, but you’re no longer going to do the project so KAA will continue to be the operator.
And KAA is now asking for additional time, a deferral because the application was submitted by KIUC based upon a sort of a hydro project that’s no longer going to be built. Since KAA is going to remain to be the operator you now want to reassess what kind of infrastructure you may want to install there to ensure that all the users get adequate water. Is that correct or did I miss something? Is that correct, Joshua?
Chair, I think what Dawn would probably say as she said earlier that they designed phase one separate from whether the energy project would go forward. The scenario that changed in the middle was whether KAA would remain the operator earlier in the process actually. The request was made, and ADC board had granted the request from KIUC to actually plan to remove KAA as the operator even prior to phase two. Just in the intervening period it became clear that if KAA was removed no one would remain to operate the ditch. We remained in the role to operate the ditch, but this was unclear when the designs were being evaluated at the time. The context of us just taking the design evaluation as something we would not have to operate and wouldn’t be responsible for ensuring the delivery assurances, that was our perspective when we evaluated even the phase one design originally. Now that we have very recently figured out that this is going to be in all likelihood permanent and we will be responsible, that of course presupposes we remain the ditch operator for ADC’s infrastructure which our agreement has to be renewed periodically. I can’t say that it’s the permanent situation but at least for now that’s the way we’re evaluating the design is, okay if now that we change perspective to being responsible for delivering the water to the end users in the amounts that they’ve requested and expected to receive even under the agreement, these are our concerns.
I’m a little confused. All of these parties have been involved in these decisions for what seven, almost 10 years and I find it not credible when someone says, oh we never knew we were going to take it over. None of this stuff was set in concrete at the beginning, these were all supposed to be part of the discussion and the decision making, so I just don’t understand why it would come as a surprise to any party that, oh they may be the one that’s running the ditch. But anyway, besides all of that, I’m fine with delaying this a bit but not very much. It seems to me that you’re either going to come to an agreement or not. You’re either going to have decided what the final decision is going to be and since you guys have been involved in this for years, I don’t see why we need to delay it much further than maybe next time.
Chair if I may, this is Dawn Huff again. If I may just make one clarification, the license that we had with ADC had an embedded lease and the lease was tied to KIUC, the execution of the lease was tied to completion of 343 for the West Kauaʻi Energy Project and KIUC taking over the operation of the ditch. KIUC did not contemplate or plan to take over operation of the ditch and our understanding of the license and lease agreement is we would not take over operation of Kōkeʻe Ditch until we initiated construction on the West Kauaʻi Energy Project or until we completed the 343 process and executed the lease for the West Kauaʻi Energy Project. I just want to make that clarification, maybe there’s some internal confusion or misunderstanding between us and ADC, but from our perspective that was our understanding of the terms of the lease.
I too find it a little frustrating that we’re now at this hour and after years of the working group meeting, obviously assumptions were made that the KIUC project was going to move forward, and nobody really put in consideration for other options. Now it’s saddled with the Water Commission when our real role was to ensure that the IIFS is being met and the terms of the settlement agreement are being met, but we’re sort of being asked, okay put a hold on our process to let everybody else catch up. I do find that a little frustrating because it does impact these people who have negotiated in good faith who are relying upon this water. I’m assuming that during this if there is a determination by the commission to grant a deferral that the downstream users including DHHL will not be impacted by the status quo, is that correct, maybe Jonathan?
Yes, that is correct Chair. If I may and this is also in response to the excellent point on frustration with this raised by you and Commissioner Miike. If we did things again perhaps, we would have started to investigate further how our deliveries would continue under a no West Kauaʻi Energy Project, but our investment and our good faith efforts have just been focused on helping the agreement successfully be implemented and that’s where our attention was. It was not, at least on behalf of DHHL, an attempt to deliberately delay the process or obfuscate any issues or do anything against the Commission’s wishes. We were working hard to make sure this would be successful because it was going to allow us to settle lands that were set aside in 1921. We want to see it happen.
I apologize, I’m just going to ask one more question to Joshua. Joshua and Lyle, both of you have raised issues. How much time are you asking?
Just speaking for KAA, I think 60 days probably should be enough at least for us to come to an agreement as to what we think would be a feasible plan going forward. I can’t speak to if there’s engineering work that needs to be done as a result of that and what it would take to prepare that in principal agreement into something that’s a submittal for the Commission to consider, but I don’t think it should take us very long to actually come to an agreement.
I was going to sort of dovetail on what Elena had said earlier about 30 days, but I think 30 days would be good. I think 60 days would be better. I think that would be our position and that’s just to come to agreement on how we should be moving forward. But ADC for our part, I’m not authorized to speak for the board, but I probably could. I know we’re committed to seeing this project through, seeing the terms of the Waimea Watershed Agreement, seeing this through. It’s just with the termination of this portion of the West Kauaʻi Energy Project, it’s thrown a bit of a wrench into what we were planning and now we’re just respectfully requesting a little bit of additional time to sort of regroup, come to some agreement within the working group so that we can move forward.
Dean would the applicant still be KIUC, or would the applicant change?
That’s a question for the applicant and the other parties, particularly KAA and ADC.
Dean, you need time, too, to write up the reports. If we said it came back here in 60 days and two months that means their agreement has to be achieved like in 30 days so that you have time to craft a new submittal.
I think in that case it Would presume that KIUC is the applicant, and the amendments are made to the application to bring that back in that time frame.
I would agree with that but if this is delayed any further and if they’re asking for more time then I would say that as part of the deferral is that if nothing is brought to us within say 60 days, then we consider the current application as the standing application.
I would be very interested if KAA is willing to share that report to make sure that our staff or we have access to it because it seems some assumptions, a lot of tension is sort of riding on it.
Okay, Joshua and Lyle can you share that report if you have...have you shared that report with CWRM? Ayron, why don’t you come on up.
Commissioner, Joshua Uyehara again for KAA. The base hydrological analysis was shared as part of the sort of discussions for the mediation and I think the discussion here today was how do you infer what the end result is going to be if this is the condition in the stream for our analysis. We look at the infrastructure that’s planned and we look at other things like whether Puʻuloa would be renovated or not, then what? The report is shared but there’s a whole bunch of steps in between and there’s room for reasonable parties to disagree as to what is going to happen in the end because it’s kind of uncertain. We’re taking what we view as a responsible view on that and opinion on that as a responsible ditch operator. Other people might not necessarily come to the exact same conclusions but whatever information people would be interested, we’re more than willing to share and that’s been what we’ve been doing in the spirit of the mediation process.
Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Branch. I agree with Josh that the original data that went into establishing the instream flow standards and the availability of water for off-stream uses including for DHHL, it was a modeling exercise that everybody agreed to the assumptions of the model and moving forward that was basically 2016, maybe early 2017 but mostly 2016. The plan was for the agreement to be implemented somewhat rapidly so that we could get monitoring on the ground to verify or update information available that went into the instream flow standards, principally water available at some of these smaller streams that don’t have a USGS gage or maybe had four years of data from 1921 to 1925 which may not be relevant in today’s climate period. There was a little bit of frustration in the delayed implementation because we didn’t get any of the phase one information coming until commission staff went out and actually installed the gages in 2022. We had five years of lost data opportunity and so now with KIUC not moving forward with phase two, I also understand that ADC, they don’t want to be stuck with infrastructure that’s going to be either costly to maintain or impossible to maintain or something they wouldn’t have designed themselves. I don’t want to speak for either entity but maybe KAA can come to some sort of agreement with KIUC where they either they share the costs or KAA decides on what design they would move forward to and they would move forward with the permitting process because there’s Army Corp permits that are needed. KIUC has been bouncing back and forth between agencies, between landowners and they want to just get what was on the books three years ago implemented but that’s not necessarily relevant today because the project, the phase two project, isn’t going to move forward. I also agree that we can come together and evaluate what data we do have now and compare it to what was predicted based on the modeling efforts that KAA did. Maybe we do need to update the IIFS, maybe there are other modifications that would meet the IIFS that aren’t being considered at the moment that KAA would rather implement. There is some wiggle room there and, but I also agree that KIUC wants to just move forward.
They should have moved forward a little earlier.
Rather than characterize wiggle room like you want to get out of something, I think really what we’re talking about is taking the moment to do something to affirm our commitment and to do it better.
60 days seems ambitious given what you said Ayron is that the original IIFS was based upon certain assumptions and models with the data that you had. Now you have perhaps hopefully newer data, but you may end up amending that IIFS based upon. Again 60 days and KAA may decide to have a whole different system because they’re now going to have to maintain it. We’re obviously extremely frustrated and I’m hoping Dawn that whoever the applicant is, I mean this was a responsibility of KIUC. I am hoping that KIUC will honor its commitment to work with these entities to come up with something that may be not necessarily what KIUC would have done and what you would have wanted, but moving forward now with these changed circumstances working with KAA and ADC and the other stakeholders on designing something that may be more appropriate given the changed circumstances. But KIUC is going to be a contributor to that process.
Certainly, we’re happy to work with the other parties on other design considerations.
And paying for that?
KIUC, their commitment is to implement the phase one modifications, so nothing has changed about that commitment.
Thank you, I really appreciate that. You have now shared that with all of us on the screen. Thank you, I appreciate that, Dawn.
I’m not saying that we need to modify the IIFS with this process.
Sorry, just to clarify the date so if you were to go with 60 days, that would put us at the end of March, roughly. The earliest that we would bring it back to Commission is at the April Commission meeting.
MOTION: (KATAYAMA / MIIKE)
To defer submittal for 60 days.
UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED (MIIKE/KATAYAMA/HANNAHS/CHANG/MEYER/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/HO)
