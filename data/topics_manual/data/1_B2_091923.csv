Request for Preliminary Approval of the Memorandum of Agreement between the State of Hawaiʻi, Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of State Parks and the Commission on Water Resource Management Regarding Installation and Maintenance of a Monitoring Well and Related Features at Hāpuna Beach State Recreation Area, South Kohala, Hawaiʻi Island
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Neal Fujii, Ryan Imata Staff stated that the Commission on Water Resource Management would delegate authority to the Deputy Director to enter into a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the State of Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of State Parks (State Parks) to allow the installation of a monitoring well within the Hāpuna Beach Recreation Area.
I just have a brief one. If you can just, because we have a large public audience, you want to just explain the value of this deep monitoring well?
Absolutely. The Waimea Aquifer system, which if you refer to your Exhibit, let’s see...the map over here. Oh, it doesn’t have the map. Waimea, there’s a lot of high level up in the Waimea town area, but much of the hydrology is unknown in the basal area. And there also may be some very deep fresh water in the area. The purpose of this well is really to get a better idea of the geology, hydrogeology, also to see if there is any deep fresh water in the area. If it turns out not to have the deep fresh, they’ll adjust the specifications and the depth of the well and things of that nature. That’s really the, one of the aquifer systems that we don’t have too much data for, so this is going to help with the science and understanding what we know. It’s also in a good location because it’s a state park, those types of easements and issues.
I just want to clarify, this is a CWRM initiative and that’s why CWRM is doing the Ka Paʻakai.
Yeah, Ka Paʻakai and consultation with Historic Preservation, all that’s going to occur kind of during the permitting process and Engineering division’s going to help us do that.
Is this the one time we’ll see this or will it come back to us?
Yeah, the permitting itself will come back to the Commission. It’s going to be like any other well that like an outside party would. This time it’s going to be like Engineering division coming in for the permitting and not necessarily CWRM personnel. Does that make sense?
Sorry Neil, I should clarify. Ryan Imata, Groundwater Branch. It’s actually going to be a ministerial permit, so we’re not going to bring it back before the Commission (inaudible). But we can certainly do some informational briefing once it’s drilled and once we’ve determined if we can find a deep confined lens or whether it’s going to be a drill as a conventional deep monitor well. Thanks, Neil.
Thanks for the clarification.
Just curious, how big a shaft is that diameter? Do you know?
No, I don’t.
Casing diameter? Are you talking about the casing diameter? I think the conventional deep monitor wells are about a 6-inch diameter well. We’re still discussing whether if we find the deep confined lens if we’re going to put two nested wells in one hole or possibly drill two holes. Because we’re so close to the coastline, into the basal lens it’s not that deep. What we could do is we could drill down into the basal lens, see where the basal lens is and see if there’s a deep confined. We could put one deep confined well in and then move over and drill another conventional well.
Thank you, I was just curious. That makes good sense.
Just for my own understanding, what differentiates a well permit being a ministerial versus what comes before the Commission?
That’s a good question. 
It shouldn’t be.
I don’t want to take up too much time on this. Back in 1997, the Commission adopted the Hawai‘i Well Construction Pump Installation Standards. That was to ensure that any well that’s drilled is in compliance with our standards and doesn’t need really sort of discretionary decision on part of the Commission. There are occasions, and I’ll list two of them, where we would bring a well to the, well three maybe. One of them is if there are serious disputes about it. And the other would be if they’re looking for a variance or any deviation from the well standards. And also just as a matter of course, when it’s in a designated water management area and we bring the water use permit to the Commission for approval, at the same time if there’s a pump installation permit, we bring that to the Commission just so that the approval process. We’re not approving a pump installation permit prior to someone getting a water use permit. So, those are three instances we would bring applications to the Commission. There’s also in certain cases, like with the Keauhou designation requiring some applications come to the Commission. We bring those, too. But over 95% of our well applications are approved ministerially, delegated to the Chair through the Hawai‘i Well Construction Standards.
Oh good. Thanks, Ryan. That’s all.
Maybe Ryan or Dean or Neal, I’m trying to distinguish Ka Pa‘akai. Is there ever a question as to the impact of an exploratory well on the nearshore waters, that we would require some kind of a monitoring requirement?
Ryan can answer.
Generally, monitor wells don’t have the kind of impacts that we would see via production wells. You’re not going to see any kind of depletion of freshwater coastal discharge or even impacts on other wells. We have to be very concerned though about puncturing into that deep confined and potentially causing short circuiting of the two aquifers, cross connection between the two aquifers. So, we’re very cognizant of that and want to make sure that the impacts are minimal.
I think it is just really important that we clearly distinguish that because of community’s concerns. Anytime we talk about a well permit, what are impacts? I think it is important that there’s a distinction between well construction and an exploratory well permit.
It’s not exploratory, it’s more (inaudible). CHAIR CHANG: Yeah, deep depth. Sorry, my mistake.
Sorry, I do have a comment then. In this case, we are talking about deep monitoring wells, but it sounds like it’s being used for exploratory purposes or understanding. But being cognizant that even though this might not have impacts, it might invite other types of...it’s going to drag up different kinds of questions and concerns and we should be prepared for that.
That’s a great point. And one of the things that Kaleo always advocated for was for us to have a better understanding of deep confined lens. Because I think there’s talk about drilling wells into that deep confined lens and Kaleo’s hesitation was always that we don’t have a good understanding of what’s happening with the deep confined lens. But we are focusing a lot of our efforts on trying to understand that deep confined lens so that questions can be answered and we can present the best information to you guys as decision makers.
But I think as you’re doing your Ka Paʻakai, you need to be cognizant of clearly articulating the difference between potential impacts on this well and another type of well.
Chair Chang and Commissioners my name is Jonathan Likeke Scheuer for the record. While I appear in front of you for many clients, I'm giving this testimony as my own. There is nothing that I have seen in the staff submittal that indicated that there was an attempt to drill into and discover a deep confined freshwater aquifer with low salt water in the submittal. The first I heard of it was happening to listen to the oral presentation from staff right now. I'm going to urge you to defer action on this matter for a number of reasons. Mostly and this is I think starting to hint at from Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani, if on the State's dime you determine that there is deep confined groundwater in this part of Hawaii Island, you effectively have de-leveraged all the risks that private entities will face in trying to exploit that resource for commercial purposes. It is, even if not designed explicitly as an exploratory well, functioning to identify a new water source which, given my understanding of the history that you have done a similar well along Hinalani Street and it has continued to leak water and has not been successfully capped for many, many months now is a dangerous proposition. I'm happy to answer any questions and I'm sorry to take time away from the people who have waited hours and hours like I have to testify on the Maui matters, but this matter requires testimony and I urge you to defer action.
I trust Likeke’s professional opinion and I will ask you, I will testify to ask please defer. This doesn't feel right in my naʻau and we're talking about our wai. We’ve been talking about wai all day when it comes to Maui, but this is Oʻahu and I've been at these meetings so many times and we're in a fight for our life and our future. I want to just say please defer so you can take a more careful look at what's happening here, thank you.
I would like to hear from our staff in response to what Jonathan said.
I’m going to do one question at a time.
Do you have any detail on the grouting protection should artesian conditions be encountered?
I’m going to have to defer to Ryan again as far as construction details and specifications.
Yeah, thank you. The question is about grouting with respect to finding the deep confined. I think our intent is really to approach this with a lot of caution. Again, what we learned from the Kaloko deep monitoring well and quite frankly a lot of other wells in the area is Jonathan’s comment about potential short circuiting of the aquifer. We take that very seriously and we don’t want the intent of the well to cause any kind of adverse impacts. So, as I think as they are progressing with drilling, if they find a deep confined lens and as soon as they punch through, the intent would probably be and we have to consult with our consultants on this, but the intent would probably be to seal it up. And potentially just develop, you know one well or the other well, whether we do it as a nested design or we drill two wells. Again, the intent is not for us to in any way turn this into any kind of production well. Kaleo and our staff had long discussions about the utility of this well and the utility of understanding the deep confined lens because one thing about the Big Island and actually quite frankly many areas throughout the State is we don’t understand the geology of deep confined lenses. So, that’s the intent of this proposed well. I will note that the action that you are taking today, too, has really no bearing on the actual permit itself. This is just a memorandum of understanding between CWRM and State Parks because the well is being drilled on State Parks land. Thanks.
Larry, you had a question?
Aloha, Rosa Pualeiʻia Monta, checking in from Kamuela, Hawaiʻi. I just wanted to, I didn't even know this was on the agenda today, but I just want to encourage you guys to defer also because this is another situation where we have a very resort dense area down on the coast and Hapuna has been without water for a long time. It's one of the few areas that our community is able to use and it's changed a lot in the years as far as the local demographic using it versus what it's used as now. I strongly encourage you to look more into this issue because if you all have ever been to Waimea, I want you to picture what you picture Waimea to be like because it's always been green and now it's brown and all of that water goes downhill. Gravity pulls it down to the coast. So, whether you're drilling down there or up here to feed down there, it still affects our aquifers and our water up here so please defer, mahalo.
Aloha mai Commissioners and e kala mai, I was here to testify on C-1 and just learning about this issue here. I’m calling in from Waimea. I just want to express my concern on multiple fronts. The Commission was briefed previously on the changes in the precipitation and the recharge rate for the Waimea Aquifer. I believe at this point we are beyond sustainable yield if we take into authorized planned use for Waimea. There was a proposition to combine two of the aquifers that never passed and as it stands with the data that we have and we heard that in earlier meetings by Dean, we're over 90 percent of sustainable yield and Waimea Aquifer should be designated. I'm extremely concerned with this idea that we're going to find deep water and somehow that that will change the present and current status. The work of the Commission should be directed towards addressing the issues that we have now with the data that is available and particularly with the lack of understanding of these deep- water wells as Jonathan has stated. We wouldn't want it not to be correctly done and potentially lose precious fresh water or get mixing with salt water. I would recommend the Commission also defer and I will state that you know this is another instance where if we had Deputy Manuel here, we could ask a lot more pertinent questions and I think the community might have a little more trust on this particular issue. Mahalo for your time and look forward to testifying on C-1.
Aloha, my name is Tara Rojas. I just wanted to say as well just sitting there you know I didn't realize what this issue was, but I just wanted just to bring this to attention that it says right here, Item B-1, the summary of request that the Commission on Water Resource Management Commission to delegate authority to the deputy director to enter into a MOA with the State of Hawaiʻi Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of State Parks to allow the installation of a monitoring well within the Hāpuna Beach Recreation. Then I just you know put it up really quick and I was looking at this and it says right there, the time of performance. Just to keep in mind that this kind of decisions, like where did it come up from? It seems that not a lot of people are aware until we were here and we hear about it and these are the type of things that continue to keep happening. The MOA says, shall be executed as of the date of Commission approval for this submittal. If this is going to be approved really quickly you know so we can continue on with the testimony for Lahaina, Maui, that is to be of concern. It said it would remain in effect for 10 years after which it is renewable at the option of all parties. Then there's other information about that, but just to keep that in mind. Then lastly says right here, consistency with the Hawaiʻi Water Plan, the proposed MOA will assist the Commission in accomplishing goals identified in the Water Resource Protection Plan. It says the goal of this WRPP 2019 update refers to the goal of constructing new deep monitoring wells in critical aquifers to gather and utilize data to identify impacts from pumpage, climate, and land-use changes, fresh water sustainable yields, and monitor recharge trends. Then the purpose of it is again to test the Waimea Aquifer System by collecting data but the thing is this type of thing I think we should all look at. What is this Water Resource Protection Plan and it's under Task 1.8.1 of the 2019 update of that WRPP. I guess we should be aware of what this is and to know that how this process is that this type of thing can pop up. It seems like a nonchalant, okay we'll just approve these things, but if somebody came up and spoke who knows about it and says uh-uh. Even sitting there was just like something in the naʻau that this is the type of things that we need to know what's happening because it's going to keep coming up. Things are going to keep getting passed and so we have to just continually be aware. Mahalo.
Aloha mai kākou, for the record my name is Kāpua Sproat and I am also testifying today in my personal capacity. I, like many others in this room and outside, I actually came to testify on C-1 and I will do so later, but I wanted to share my significant concern. Looking at the submittal as it's been presented, the MOA defers the Ka Paʻakai analysis until later on. I'm just wondering, my question for you Chair because I know you're very committed to Ka Paʻakai analysis, you understand that this operationalizes the Water Commission's kuleana under Article 12 Section 7, so it's really important to do. To me, if the MOA is going to be entered into and then the Ka Paʻakai analysis is going to be done at a later date, it puts the cart before the horse because shouldn’t the Ka Paʻakai analysis be done first to examine precisely the issues that Jonathan and other folks and Dr. Beamer and other folks are raising so that this Commission can make an informed decision about whether or not it's sufficiently protecting traditional and customary rights and resources under Article 12 Section 7? My additional concern is that if it's being delegated then what opportunity will the community have to participate in the process? Because in my experience it's often, and I'm grateful that the Commission is taking on the kuleana to do the Ka Paʻakai analysis. I will say that without Deputy Director Manuel, I have significant concerns about the staff's ability to be able to facilitate this kind of work in communication and in partnership with the community. There’s two points. One, this puts a cart before the horse but two, especially if the Commission is going to move forward with this without the assistance and guidance and knowledge and integrity of Deputy Director Manuel, I have concerns about what additional protections or opportunity there’ll be for the community to analyze the Ka Paʻakai analysis or provide input to ensure that it's adequate. I would also strongly recommend deferring action not just because I would like to testify on C-1, but also because I have significant concerns and I know Neil and Ryan and everyone else want to make sure that this is pono and do the right thing.
I think with this conversation that we’ve been having, how would you better understand the aquifer without doing monitoring wells? Having heard today’s testimony before the Commission, earlier you described what kind of permits come before the Commission and what kind of permits are handled ministerially. Wouldn’t this show that the permit should now be handled through a Commission review? And we can move forward with executing supremely because it has nothing to do with the permit. You will then work on the permit. It puts things in the proper perspective where the Ka Pa‘akai analysis would be done at the time of the permit presentation and it shouldn’t take any longer for either one, right? Other than getting on our calendar. Does that sound reasonable hearing the public’s testimony today?
Maybe I’ll speak up as the Chair of the department. Clearly all of you have raised some very legitimate questions about whether it’s ministerial or whether it should be a Commission action. I think that’s a very legitimate question. We’ve had some internal discussions about that. I appreciate, Kāpua, the question about Ka Pa‘akai and even Jonathan’s question about what does this mean. Perhaps, Dean, we should consider deferring this matter to really address some of the larger policy questions that have been raised here. I think that seems to be appropriate.
I would also advise deferment. We understand so little about how our aquifers are connected that if we, through punching these holes create a connection, we not might not be able to stop it. And again, if Deputy Director Manuel was here, I trust his input greatly and I would maybe feel more confident that we had the data. We have a lot of ways to understand what is under the ground now. I would like to have more detail about whether we're doing seismic testing. We can use minor charges to get information about what is under the ground we are on to make sure that we are not potentially connecting things that haven't been connected before. Thank you.
Can I add a couple specific things maybe for the staff to consider the concerns that were raised and should be addressed in the next submittal? And include the Ka Pa‘akai analysis on the front end. At least to address the concerns (inaudible). To the extent that these can really be considered and really justified. We value the O‘ahu deep monitoring wells for helping us understand our aquifer. We do need them in other places, but the geology is different on different islands. How are we addressing, thinking about this proactively and very consciously, given the drama around the other wells that sort of preceded my time. But like let’s take that in, address it in the front, and then make the next necessary steps. And why it’s needed for Waimea, just as Dr. Beamer had mentioned. To really justify it so it’s on record. I’d appreciate that.
MOTION: (MEYER / HANNAHS) To defer staff submittal. UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED (MIIKE/KATAYAMA/HANNAHS/CHANG/MEYER/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/HO)
