B3.  
B3, okay. Thank you. I don't see any questions, Scot. I think you've answered whatever we had. Thank you so much for the presentation.  
Okay, thank you.  
Thank you. You know, I notice it's twelve o'clock. Do you want to take a lunch break before we move into Item B3?  
It's up to you, Chair. I don't know how long Item B3 is planning to take, but let me   
Is Abbey and Franz there?  
Yeah, let me  let me admit B3 item presenters.  
I don't have the same lunch you guys do, so   (Laughter.)  
Abbey and Franz, do you guys know how long your presentation will take?  
I'm actually an observer on the  on the plan, so  but we do have meetings this afternoon, so   
Okay. Let's just go ahead, then. Let's go ahead. We'll do your presentation, and then we'll take a lunch break after that. Go ahead  Thank you so much.  
You know, you're gonna (inaudible).  
Great. So thank you, commission, for inviting us to speak today. I am  I have two different devices, so I'm gonna share screen from   
Go ahead. We'll do your presentation, and then we'll take a lunch break after that. Go ahead.  
Barry or Abbey, your YouTube is on; you've got to shut it off.  
Sorry. It's mine. Thank you. Sorry.  
Okay. So thank you, Commission, for   
Sorry about that. We were planning about a half an hour presentation and it depends on how the question and answer would go. So up to you if you want to take a lunch break. We're happy to come in after; it's up to you.  
Oh, Chair, you're on mute  you're on mute.  
Yeah. No, I saw Neil nodding his head. Let's go forward, and then we'll let you guys conclude  go through your presentation, and then after that, we'll take lunch and do our action item. So go ahead, Barry and Abbey.  
Okay. And I  just as one request, I am doing this from two different devices, and I'm still in the waiting room for my  oh, it looks like I'm being connected now. Great, thank you so much. I will share my screen from this device. 
Abbey, I'll start.   
Yes, thank you.   
So (inaudible)    
Thanks, Barry.   
This is a briefing on the East Honolulu Watershed Management Plan as part of the overall Oʻahu Water Management Plan, the county water use and development plan. So I'm Barry Usagawa, head of the Water Resources Division at the Honolulu Board of Water Supply. I'm with Abbey Seitz from Planning For Community. Next. Okay, next. So we're gonna  this is our agenda. I wanted to talk about the plan status, the framework, the goals and objectives. And then I wanted to just expand on the chapter  this is Chapter 1, Oʻahu Water Management Plan overview, which is the island water use and development plan. And then Abbey is going to then jump into the regional watershed plan, which is East Honolulu, talk about the planning process and schedule, the Watershed Profile Chapter 2, and the current and future water demands in East Honolulu, the specific objectives, and basically policies, project  projects and strategies and how we plan to implement it.And then we're just about ready for the public review draft. We just went through an agency review draft with the commission staff and the Department of Planning and Permitting, and then the approval process is how we think we are going to get the plan approved through city council and the commission, and then the Q & A at the end. Next. So the status of the plans, as you may know that we're instead of one island plan, we're doing eight. We've because it allows us to take a deeper dive into each region and come up with place-based strategies and projects and align better with the city land use plans. But we've so far got Waiʻanae, North Shore, Koʻolau Loa, and Koʻolau Poko Watershed Management Plans approved by the commission and accepted into Ordinance Chapter 30. We still have South Oʻahu still pending, and we apologize for the delay, but we're trying to address climate change, and so this East Honolulu is our first chance to actually tell you about what we've done to try to build that into some scenario planning. Next. So you're familiar with this, but I just wanted to dive a little bit deeper into this. Of course, the state water code, the general plan, and the legal..regulatory framework. A little bit on the Hawai‘i Water Plan, you're familiar with the four components that the county water use and development plan has to account for, include the state findings of the other state plans. You know, just the name of the county water use and development plan per se is somewhat limiting, although it's broader, but in the tight, it's basically a plan for water use and development, basically how much  where's the water, how much do you need, and how are you gonna get it there? And so it should incorporate management of water and conservation and protection and restoration. And so the council back in 1990 either renamed it or named it the O‘ahu Water Management Plan, and this is the framework. A little bit of the statewide framework of 2000, there is a Section 3-26 that allows for flexibility, for innovation to accommodate unique and county-specific concerns tailored to each county, and so that's why we broke it up into eight regional plans. In July of 2022, there was a presentation on some of the updates that could be made to the statewide framework. Those gaps were climate uncertainty, applying indigenous knowledge, ag water, plan utility, and integrating land use and water policies and agencies into the plan. And by breaking it up into these regional watershed management plans, we feel that we've addressed a large part of thatAnd so you may know that Oʻahu's broken up in the general plan into eight land-use districts. There are two development plan areas that are primarily urban center, basically Honolulu and then ʻEwa are the directed growth  directed growth areas, so all the growth is directed to these areas, and that's where our infrastructure investment is concentrated. The other six land use districts are rural and urban fringe, so it's to keep the country country by moving the development towards, you know, those two districts. And the specific policies in these land use plans that are incorporated in these regional plans, they're  these regions are very different, and so we are able to tailor each of the regional plans to the specific regions. And Act 152 for Watershed Protection, the Waiāhole Ditch Decision, the ordinance Chapter 30, our mission, you know, all provide guidance into the plan. And recently, the Mayor's Climate Change and Sea Level Rise Directive of 2018 and it was updated in 2022, I believe, brings in guidance on what to do with sea level rise. And the Ola Oʻahu Resilience Strategy is how we make the  Oʻahu more resilient to climate change, including, you know, the facilities, but also the resources. And so today, I'm talking about East Honolulu. So, next. So we've adopted the ahupuaʻa model in these.. watershed plans. I call it systems thinking, but it could  you know, the way I look at it, the goal is watershed health, holistic resource management, and self-sufficient and sustainable communities. We recognize that there's an interrelationship between mauka and makai, including the coastal resources, the conservation districts, the ag zones, the urban zones, and the nearshore waters, but also, what happens aboveground may affect what's underground in terms of contamination. What sets the ahupua'a model apart from traditional integrated resource plans is  the stewardship and kuleana that comes with the ahupua'a model around land, water, people, and culture. It's the culture that affects behaviors, and by improving those behaviors towards conservation, no waste, recognition of where water comes from, restoration of cultural sites and fishponds and kalo, you know, all of those get folded into these behaviors so that it  basically is the glue that supports the  what's in the plan. Okay. So, next. So our goal is  to balance the preservation and restoration, and management of Oʻahu watersheds, right, mauka to makai, with a sustainable ground and surface water use and development to serve present and future generations. In Chapter 1, we define this goal. We also define the five objectives of which are all  which are applied to all of th plans. The objectives are defined, and they are our  are defined as our future state, I guess. So what does a sustainable watershed look like? So promoting that, protecting and enhancing water quality and quantity; protecting Native Hawaiian rights and traditional and customary practices; facilitating public participation, education, and project implementation  and this is the behavior side that I was talking about from the ahupua'a model  and then meeting water demands at a reasonable cost. Each of these objectives drive specific policies, projects, and strategies in each of the eight regions and  and if it wasn't  you know, we're trying to make it explicit. It's not just happens if you do something; we're directly trying to meet these objectives in each of these regional plans. Okay, next. So I just wanted to talk about the  Chapter 1. Next. Chapter 1 was basically the  essentially, the same format as the first adopted O‘ahu Water Management Plan in 1990. The water code was adopted in ’87. So Chapter 1 is the  the islandwide water use and development plan. It also incorporates  what the commission did was hire Peter Adler, and he came up with the  you know, his Adler report on O‘ahu needs in 2020. So the  so the format and the  the organizational structure is very much aligned with that, andthis is in every plan. So we talk about authority and purpose, the framework which I went through in the water use and development plan, which talks about islandwide demand forecasts, supply availability for urban and agriculture, conservation, existing and planned sources, alternatives and transfers, and I believe there's a discussion about how we transfer water around the island because we have the infrastructure to do that. The Adler report talked about certain uncertainties such as in-stream and appurtenant rights, Hawaiian Homeland alternative source costs, alternative source impacts to aquifers, and the recharge rates and  and pumping effects to streams. What we added here is a contingency section that offers a list of strategies on what to do about it. And so I would encourage you to read that when the public review draft comes out, and I'll get into that in more detail. The plan implementation is how we allocate water, how we invest in infrastructure, you know, the reasonable and beneficial uses is defined first through the water use permits, and then we allocate water on a first-come, first-served basis with an adequate facilities review. I might add that when we do allocate water, we also look at reasonable and beneficial uses, ensure that conservation measures are employed, ensure that  require them to connect.to recycled water systems if they're adjacent before we can  before we issue the meter. So it's conditional to those types of uses. Next. In the uncertainties and contingencies, we describe what some of the  you know, all the uncertainties that we could think of that have been affecting planning over the last couple of decades. Estimating and recovering sustainable yield is  it's one  you folks were talking about estimating sustainable yield; how do we recover that? And you can't recover it all in a lot of places. How does climate change and drought impacts affect recharge and sustainable yield, and what to do about it? Contamination, of course Groundwater-dependent ecosystems are brought up the last  in the last administration, so we have a section on that Basically, sustainable yield is a percent of recharge. The remaining percent is allowed to flow to the ocean to support these ecosystems, and that  you know, we had some strategies around that I know there's some interim in-stream flow standards, effects on stream flows, and protection and restoration there Drought impacts to stream flows and the diversions and use, so it's conjunctive use of using stream diversions and wells, you know, in drought times to  so you can maximum the stream flow. How do you make ditch irrigation systems more efficient through piping the ditches? And then uncertainties around urban and agricultural demands. Urban is fairly  you know, it's  you know, everybody wants to bank water, so they end up having the demands high. I see agricultural demands as having a wider range. But anyway, we have these sections where we tried to estimate uncertainties and provide some solutions so  on an islandwide basis. Okay. The next slides, I'm gonna turn it back over to Abbey to get into the East Honolulu regional plan. Thank you.
Great. Thank you so much, Barry, for providing that context. As he mentioned, the remainder of the presentation, I will be zoomed in specifically to the East Honolulu Watershed Management Plan.  So just a little bit of background in terms of the planning process to develop this regional plan. This  our process is  was divided up into five key phases  starting off with the research and identification of the key water resource issues for the district, then moving into an analysis of the  both existing and future water supply, and Then moving into the development of both the agency and public review draft, and obviously we'll end on the development and adoption of the final plan. Having throughout this process, having stakeholder consultations as well as four different community meetings. As a quick note about the schedule, we did begin this process in early 2019, and with this year  at the beginning of the year, we had released the agency review draft, recently integrated feedback from that, and will be soon releasing the public review draft, and are looking to hopefully have the plan adopted by the end of this year. As mentioned, we've had stakeholder consultations throughout this process with both community organizations that work in the district on various activities related to watershed health, as well as county and state agencies, in addition to regular neighborhood board presentations to the district's three neighborhood boards, and in addition to the community meetings that were just mentioned. So now I'll be moving into Chapter 2, which really sets the foundation for the plan as it provides a profile of the district's eight  ten different watersheds. And as mentioned, as Barry mentioned, this plan takes a very comprehensive view of watershed health, so this chapter really digs into all the different historical, cultural, environmental factors that impact watershed health. As  just as a quick kind of context, the district again encompasses ten different watersheds and spans from Kahala to Makapu'u. Through our process of both research as well as stakeholder consultations, this Chapter 2 really kind of culminates around eight different water resource issues that kind of rose to the top of the community's priorities in terms of issues that are impacting watershed health in the area, and those are including climate change, sea level rise, nearshore water quality, flooding and drainage, wildfires, and others that are listed here. And so, while I don't have time in this presentation to get, obviously, into all of those topics, I just wanted to highlight within this plan that we do provide both analytical as well as spatial data both analytically and spatially to discuss these different topics that were just mentioned. For example, to kind of better understand both opportunities and challenges for topics such as cultural resources, our team both mapped out historical and existing resources such as fishponds, freshwater springs, heiaus, as well as the traditional ahupua'a boundaries. And then as another example, to better understand the topic of wildfire hazard, in addition to both mapping out where recent wildfires have occurred, we're also mapping out the wildland-urban interface to better understand wildfire vulnerability. And so, both of those are just examples to show the type of in-depth analysis that we went through for all the different factors that were presented in Chapter 2. So moving on to Chapter 3, as mentioned, this content is focused on understanding both the existing as well as the future water demand and supply and understanding how that essentially impacts the water source availability for the district. As I'm sure the commission knows, East Honolulu area encompasses two different groundwater aquifer system areas, the Wai'alae West and Wai'alae East, which combined have a relatively low sustainable yield at 4.5 million gallons per day. Historically, over the last about 30 years, the district has used more water per capita than the islandwide average. For example, in 2010, East Honolulu residents, on average, used about 194 gallons per water per person per day, which is about 25 percent higher than the islandwide average. So in total, and this map is showing the Board of Water Supply transfers based on 2013 to 2017 averages, the district used an average of about 8.38 million gallons per day of Board of Water Supply water, with the majority of that water being supplied by transfers from the Honolulu sources, and a smaller amount of that being supplied by transfers from Windward in addition to in-district pumping, which accounts for about 16 percent of the Board of WaterWater Supply water demand. Just kind of quickly to note in regards to the water uses, the majority, as you can see here, is for residential uses, with a smaller amount going towards commercial uses. And in terms of specific water users of Board of Water Supply water, the largest user is the Hawai‘i Kai Golf Course. So next, moving into future water demand, to project future water demand, we came up with a range of different scenarios, three different scenarios to project water demand in the year 2040, the low, mid, and high, and then two different water demand scenarios for the year 2100. We don't necessarily have the time here to get into all the specific details of these water demand scenarios, but the low demand scenario does represent the most probable as it follows the city's population projections as well as the anticipated water conservation efforts; whereas, the mid demand and high demand scenarios include potential other futures considering if population were to increase or water conservation were to be decreased in certain ways. Additionally, the ultimate demand scenarios include factors such as the impacts of sea level  of 3.2 feet of sea level rise as well as the differences in rainfall projections with two different sub scenarios being based on the wet rainfall projection as well as the dry So based on our analysis, we find that the low demand, the  again, that one being the most probable, would result in an estimated 8.5 million gallons of water used per day, total water usage, and obvious  again, the mid and high scenarios are unlikely that they would be proliferated, but we anticipate that in the mid scenario, there would be about 9.6 million gallons per day, and the high would be 11.96 million gallons per day. In summary, based on our analysis of comparing the  essentially, the water demand with the anticipated water supply in 2040, we have found that in the most probable scenario, there would be existing  the existing water supply would be adequate, but in the high or mid or high demand scenarios, that this would require additional water resources or improved water efficiency. Similarly, in the ultimate demand scenario, even though it is obviously more difficult to project out water supply, it  in  at such a great time distance from 2100, we estimate that under the wet scenario, because of  because of anticipated increased rainfall, there would be adequate water supply, and in the dry scenario that there would need to be improved water efficiency to meet the water demand. So kind of all this is to say in terms of our key takeaways from this water analysis that both kind of under theexisting situation as well as the future scenarios, that even though we do project that East Honolulu would have adequate supply under the most probable scenario, that due to their limited in-district supply, they have a heightened kuleana to user water efficiency  efficiently due to the impacts that water transfers can have on the districts that they're being transferred from. So next, I'll be moving into Chapter 4, which is focused on the goals, policies, as well as descriptions of the projects, programs, and strategies to achieve those goals and objectives. As a quick note regarding how these policies, projects, and strategies are all related, some of those  the water resource issues that were discussed previously in this presentation that were highlighted in Chapter 2, as well as the results of the water demand analysis informed the district's sub-objectives. From there, the projects with champions as well as the general strategies essentially align with those sub-objectives and are used to advance  advance those policies, and from  from all of those projects emerged the catalyst projects, which are essentially the  the vehicle being  we see as being used to implement the projects and strategies. As a note, we have identified 30 different projects with champions, so these projects with champions haveither an existing community or government champion who has been slated to carry out these efforts. And they cover a wide range of activities such as fishpond restoration, heiau restoration, coral assistant evolution, invasive species removals, and so forth. And just as  again, wanted to point out that these projects are both site-specific; we have about nine  we have nine projects that are site-specific with the remaining 21 projects being focused districtwide. So at a lower tier than the projects, we have the strategies and programs. And so while these activities are also slated to advance the sub-objectives that we've identified in the plan, they do not have an existing project  they do not have an existing community or government champion; however, they are, you know, still important for advancing the objectives that were outlined in the plan. So lastly, Chapter 5, we're moving into implementation. This chapter discusses the water use and development plan, so essentially goes into more detail regarding some of the topics discussed in Chapter 3 around the strategies for ensuring water source adequacy for the region, and then goes into the priority watersheds, the catalyst projects, implementation entities, and potential funding. So for the purposes of this presentation, I'll focus on the catalyst projects, which are essentially just a higher Priority project that will provide the energy and connectivity for the different projects and programs that we've outlined in this plan. Some components of these projects will be focused in priority watersheds, which we're defining as watersheds that require special protection for water quality or provide special opportunities for implementing watershed management programs. For the East Honolulu Watershed Management Plan, we have identified two key catalyst projects. The first is to improve water quality in Maunalua Bay, which came up repeatedly in our consultations with community groups as well as our government stakeholders. We're looking to focus that catalyst project in the priority watersheds, essentially the six watersheds within the district that feed into the bay. The second catalyst project is to increase water efficiency, stemming from our water demand analysis, emphasizing that water conservation is key in the district. For each of these catalyst projects, we identify measurable goals to achieve through these projects, including reducing the amount of invasive algae and increasing the amount of healthy living coral, among others. I wanted to emphasize that this catalyst project...sing the implementation of it within these priority watersheds that feed into the bay, and this  this catalyst project, we've identified various different actions to achieve and carry out the catalyst project. Many of these actions have actually been previously identified by the Moanalua Watershed Hui, which is essentially a collective of community groups that are working to improve the quality of the bay. So I wanted to highlight, as you can see from that last map, these actions are both located in both mauka and makai areas. For example, in the Wailupe Watershed, we've identified the Wailupe Watershed stream restoration as one of the key actions. In the Niu Watershed in the upper watershed, we've identified watershed fencing, mid  the middle watershed invasive species removal and native out-planting, and then in the lower watershed, the invasive algae removal, which is being carried out by Malama Maunalua. Kuli‘ou‘ou, we identified ongoing fishpond restoration as well as watershed retention and infiltration in the upper watershed. In Haha‘ione, we've identified wetland and heiau restoration, which is currently being carried out. And lastly, in the Kamilo Nui and Kamilo Iki, identified a range of actions, including reforestasustainable agricultural pilot project, as well as restoration of Kuapā Pond. So moving now into Catalyst Project No. 2, again, we  which is to increase water efficiency in East Honolulu, again, we identified measurable goals, which include maintaining East Honolulu's per capita water demand through 2040 at 170 gallons per person per day, and then a longer range goal to reduce per capita water demand to 130 per  gallons per person per day by 2100. So these actions that carry out this catalyst project are looked at a more districtive view from both increasing essentially water efficiency from the distributors as well as the water users. I can say with the exception of the action we've identified in the Koko Head Watershed, which is developing R1 recycled water for large irrigation users in Hawai‘i Kai. So I wanted just to note that within the plan itself  I know that was kind of a very quick overview of a lot of information, but within the plan itself, we want to make this as action-oriented as possible, and so we do include essentially a matrix that serves as an action plan and identifies the goals, champions, potential partners, the status, the costs, and target implementation for each of these actions identified as part of the two catalyst projects. So lastly, I wanted to end on just a few updates Regarding the public review draft and our timeline for approval. So as our next steps to the public review draft, we are very close to releasing it online. We anticipate making that publicly available by the end of next week on the Board of Water Supply project webpage. We also are underway in terms of presenting the public review draft to the district's three neighborhood boards, and we'll also be holding a virtual community meeting on the draft on August 24th from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. And lastly, I wanted to turn it over to  back to Barry to provide a little bit more of a detail on  on the approval process with the city and the state commission. Thank you.
Thank you, Abbey. Just wanted to get through the adoption process. So once we do the public review draft, and we obtain the comments and revise the plan accordingly, you know, we then submit it  we present it to our board, we present it to PPP, and the water commission, but  you know, I apologize for the complexity of the flowchart on the bottom right, but just to explain the city council adoption. And this is adopted by ordinance. There are five touchpoints. There are three readings, first, second, and third reading. The third reading is adoption. The first reading is just an introductionbetween the  those readings are two committee meetings, and the committee is planning and sustainability. That may be outdated; this is an older graphic. What we're trying to do is have some interaction between the public meetings, the council meetings, and the water commission public hearing. The timeframes historically have been different. So the city council, once we  once we get the neighborhood board endorsements, the city council in the past has processed and adopted the plan within about three months. So we were thinking that if we could notice the public hearing prior to us submitting it to council, and then that the public hearing would then occur such that in the  in the first meeting, we can say  we gather input, and then at the water commission public hearing, we can provide that input for the record. And then we go to the city council's second committee meeting, the input that we get at the water commission's public hearing can then be made record of, you know, in the  in the city council process. Because what we wanted to do is get that interaction before the  before the council adopts it as ordinance because once it's adopted as ordinance, it's hard to change. So we want to ensure that there's interaction and there's discussion there. And so after it's adopted by council, then it  then it'll be submitted for adoption at the water commissionThis is what we tried last time, and I think the public hearing occurred after all of the committee meetings. We were lucky that it went through, but anyway, that's what we're trying to do. If the staff feels that it's appropriate to notice the public hearing so that we can time the actual public hearing in alignment with the city council adoption, I think it took six months for the commission because of the 90-day notice the last time. So, anyway, that's the approval process, and I think that's the last slide there, Abbey. We're available for questions if there are any. 
A little longer than we thought, 30 minutes, but that's okay. Commissioners, any questions? Oh, Aurora. 
Sorry, question again. 
Go ahead. 
Just a quick question given what Barry said about East Honolulu having the highest per capita water use and then in the East Honolulu plan, there wasn't a—I'm curious why there isn't more aggressive reduction of per capita water use because it's not aligning for me what Barry said and what Abbey said on the projected demand being stable or decreasing my words are not coming together. I'm a little tired. So basically, why is there not more aggressive reduction of per capita water use in the plan?
It would  we were tying the reduction in per capita based on the amount of supply that we thought we would have, and so what we did in the  in our water research foundation study, we took the  the USGS recharge rates and  applied that to the UH 2100 forecast, the rainfall forecast, right? One wet, one  dynamical was wet; statistical was dry. And we  and then we calculated roughly what the sustainable yields would be in both scenarios, yeah. So in the low  I mean, in the dry scenario, the sustainable yields dropped by something in the range of 30 percent, and so reducing the amount of supply available to East Honolulu, we felt that bringing it down to 130 per capita would be sufficient for the demand to  to, you know, align with the  what we think the supply may be.  Now, these scenarios that's 80 years away, and there's gonna be other, you know, evaluations of sustainable yield. There are other  there are other cities that can go to a hundred per capita. And, in fact, when you see primarily center, because of the density, we think we can go down to a hundred. But in East Honolulu, there's a lot of large properties, a lot of swimming pools up there, so it's harder to get it lower. But if you can get the golf course off the potable system and onto recycled water, that will do a lot better. Ala Wai Golf Course has their own well. But the effluent at the Hawai‘i Kai Resource Treatment Plant is salty; they have to desalinate that, and the sea level rise is gonna make it worse, so that will be challenging. But we tied it to what we thought was the available supply, so 
Okay. Larry, go ahead.
Yeah. So basically, your answer is that to East Honolulu, you're only gonna get a certain amount of water, and you've gotta live with that, and that's why you're getting a decrease.
Yeah. And historically, it has been decreasing down from 190  the 170 is  when we started to calculate the 2020 numbers, they're actually at 170 now. And they can get a little bit lower with our rebates and stuff, but that's how we would do that rather than desalination because we're doing that, you know, at ‘Ewa. So instead of increasing or augmenting the supply, it's easier to just try to get their demand down to what we think would be available.
I've got a question. Oh, go ahead, Neil.
I couldn't go through your list of stakeholders consulted fast enough to see. Was Kamehameha Schools on that list as the largest private
Is it their landowner?   
It should be, yeah, they own the majority of the land.   
They own the golf course. Is it their  is that golf course lease renewal kind of part of their  is that an assumption?   
Yes.   
Has there been discussion with them to see if that's the highest and best use of that land in terms of their unique mission?   
No, we didn't talk about  as far as I remember, we didn't talk about changing or, you know, closing the golf course. It was trying to supply it with an alternative source.   
You might want to just broach the discussion with them. I'm not saying it's an easy  it's an easy  there's a lot of reliance and acceptance of the golf course, but given their mission, what it provides for their mission is fairly limited in relationship to the impact of this being the largest water user in  in that area. And granted, yeah, if they could get off potable, that would be helpful to this equation, but by the same token, that's a lot of land that might be  have a more powerful contribution to their mission if redeployed.   
I'm gonna be a little bit more candid.
I'm putting on my DLNR hat. You know, your report just emphasized the disparate treatment. We ask  I mean, here we are assuming that that golf course  and we can let East Honolulu continue to take more water than the rest of the island, and we are not  I mean, when I look at your Catalyst No. 1, that are  that's all conservation, environmentalists, culture groups who are willing to put, you know  I don't know who's funding all of this. I suspect they're all going out and getting private funds.
Yes.
They're getting federal funds. But I do not see a like  a like response by your largest users, the swimming pool guys, the golf course guys. I mean  but it just  when I look at one end of the  one end of the island, I look at  I look at Leeward Oʻahu, everything is getting dumped over there, and those guys on the  on the leeward side, they have a little bit of water for agricultural, which is sustainable. But on East Honolulu, we're paying for swimming pools and a golf course. I mean, I am sorry, I'm  because I struggle with that at DLNR.we are struggling with water management  watershed management plans. How  our struggle is how do we charge the users an equitable amount for their impacts to our watersheds?  And I guess I just  I'm frustrated because I don't see a like  a like kind of appreciation when, you know, here in  I don't  I guess I just don't see that there is a  a measurable response to those who are using the most. But yet I've got all of these nonprofit groups running out there trying to get money to do these wonderful projects, and I don't see government trying to, you know, tell  I think, you know, it's like Neil says, maybe Kamehameha Schools has to rethink that, or maybe the swimming pools.  But I don't know, Barry and Abbey, is there  I mean, what  what kind of efforts is BWS  you know, do we just ask nicely or do  or do we just turn off the stick? I mean, like I said, I'm tired; this has been kind of a long morning, but I  yet, I'm struggling at DLNR because we have the same issues, and I'm trying to tell these large landowners, you've gotta pay  you have to pay for watershed management on East Maui. 
Right.
How do  how is this  how is this equitable here?
Good question. You know, two thie going into the next water rate increase in the next month, and, you know, the golf courses—the three golf courses that irrigate with potable water right now from our system—they're gonna—you know, they may go out of business, man, I don't know. It's gonna increase their water costs, they're gonna have to raise rates, you know, and so, you know, that may be a way to—well, certainly when prices go up, people use less. And they've been trying to use less. I know the golf course provides an income stream to Kamehameha Schools to further their educational mission. They have the—they own the areas around Koko Marina as well, you know. Those—those commercial properties—in fact, there was a presentation last night at the Hawai‘i Kai Neighborhood Board where—led by, I guess, Michelle Swartman and her team on revisioning—their entire properties, you know, in East Honolulu. Most of them—most of the lands are mauka, as Commissioner Hannahs knows, and, you know, they're trying to fold in culture and—but also supply, you know, funding for their—for their educational needs. So they're just starting in that process. You know, those are real good questions, what's gonna happen with the golf course? And that's—we kind of—in the plan, we tried to react to that. We did do an investigation on recycled water for the golf course, this is with American Water, which isprivate company that owns the wastewater treatment plan, and the previous owners of the golf course, and it wasn't economically feasible. You know, they need an influx of grants or something to put in the treatment so they can use it. But we were trying to help  or I was trying to help their discussion. But I hear what you're saying; there is an equity issue there, but they're gonna have to pay the higher rates like everybody else, and the big users are gonna feel it, and then they're gonna have to conserve more or pay the bill. 
I'll be clear, Barry, especially with my background, I'm  I would not want to see Kamehameha Schools treated unfairly or  
No. 
in this, but I think they have the potential to be a catalyst project as well. And it's gonna take dialogue. And you've got good people like Michelle there to work with. Just gotta, you know, catalyze  make that dialogue happen and see where it goes. 
We'll express that to them. 
Aurora. 
Going off of Chair Chang's comment, given East Honolulu's reliance on transfers Are projects  I mean, how is the Board of Water Supply kind of addressing the dependence of the district, you know, on other water management areas that can't reap the benefits of these particular projects? Like, is there a way  because it's probably  the income, you know, disparity of East Honolulu versus ‘Ewa, you know, we don't  is there consideration of that kind of transboundary reliance and ability to build in sort of reciprocity in that to support  to recognize the reliance of East Honolulu on conservation activities, say, in Honolulu or Ko‘olau Poko to maintain their subsidized water supply?
You know, it would have been  it would have been easy to just say we'll just get more water from Windward, but it's not there. So they have to pull their load, you know, conserve kuleana, that one slide, they need to be more efficient. We didn't  what we  we also have two well projects in the Wai‘alae West and Wai‘alae East Aquifers too to supplement. So it's not only reliant on  on transfers and conservation. There are two small well projects that we  we have on the books. But, yeah, the  in the Ko‘olau Poko and Ko‘olau Loa Watershed Plans, there's a policy in those plans about the transfer of water out of these districts shall not be detrimental to these districts. That's the only way we could get the plans adopted and endorsed by the neighborhood boards. There. So that message was communicated to East Honolulu. What we got back was like, "Hey, we're conserving, you know, and  well, yeah, but you can conserve more." We have a rebate program for rain barrels; the stormwater utility is going  they're very interested in green infrastructure and trying to recharge the aquifer too. So the community there is very surprising; they're very motivated and very active in their activities around the coast and in these cultural sites and, you know  more so than I see in other communities, too. It's just the big users like, I think, Commissioner Hannahs was talking about it, and Chair was talking about, and, you know, we can  we can probably talk to them and see how that can be resolved. They tried developing sources. It's all salty aquifer water, so it's not irrigatable. But anyway, this is what we've done so far.
Sorry, a follow-up quick question asking  remind me, the Board of Water Supply is a member of the watershed partnerships?
Yes. The Ko'olau Mountain Watershed Partnerships, yes.
Yeah. And does that mean financial, like, support 
Yes  
So that is in some way  
That was redistributing? 
Yes. We provide annual funding to  because of Act 152, and because we created a stakeholder advisory group with folks like Mark Fox in there, you know, the big advocates for watershed protection, we're funding about 300,000 plus to the Ko‘olau and the Wai‘anae Mountain Watershed Partnerships as well as the O‘ahu Invasive Species Committee, and some funding also is going to DLNR DOFA for on-the-ground projects. Invasive species control like Miconia, Albizia removal, and fencing. And that's an annual thing that we continue to do with  with our budget. So in a way, you know, the rates are funding that investment in the mauka so that we can continue to make the forests healthier.  Okay, thank you. 
By the way, we're highlighting Kamehameha Schools' tenant's use of the water, but Kamehameha Schools is probably also your largest contributor statewide to watershed partnership investment of any organization, so   Yeah, (inaudible). 
(Inaudible) values. 
I guess, Barry and Abbey, I think one The policy that I see missing is environmental justice. Since you have an islandwide  while you have these eight water management systems, it is an islandwide system that you have. There should be some level of environmental justice that perhaps how you allocate the costs  I mean, you know, again, it just kind of pains me when I think about the agricultural users down the west end who  you know, who are asked to conserve or we may not even have water for ag, yet on the east side, we've got  and I'm sure they're motivated, I'm sure they're doing their best, and they're trying, but I think there's gotta be some policy that drives a more equitable both distribution  either distribution of water or distribution of costs so that, you know, some of these  these other areas, maybe their water rates are less because they're using less. I don't know. But this slide, this presentation, I'm sorry, was a stark reality check that  I don't know if a lot of people, you know, see the stark disparity in  in East Honolulu versus West Honolulu. And I know you guys are caught between a rock and a hard place, but I mean, I think we, as government, have got to try to do  do things differently when we can see such disparity  I mean, that  we've got all these guys on the west  on the west end on  you know, they're on like drought and water conservation, so  but I am not  I'm not just criticizing you guys. I mean, I.. 
I think we're all faced with this, but I would  Can I  if you're referring to the per capita demand higher than the average, yeah, you know, they are, but they're not the highest. You know, North Shore and Wai‘anae actually are higher because of the diversified ag that we serve off of our system, yeah.
Okay.
But certainly East Honolulu should have that capacity to use less.
Right, right, right. You're right, yeah.
Maybe we need  we need to focus our incentive program to these hot spots, perhaps.
Yeah.
But I think the big-ticket items are the large users and, you know, addressing that  may go a long  a longer way than, you know  I mean, both  both strategies work.
Yes, yes.
But, yeah, thanks for the feedback on the environmental justice and  and climate equity as well, you know, that's  
Yeah.
the same kind of concept, too right? In the  in the 2100, in the sea level rise, the demand goes down because they've gotta move away from the coast. It's gonna be all flooded, right? That's the same thing that's gonna happen in PUC is that when  with six feet of sea level rise, the water demand goes down. I don't know where they're gonna go, but they cannot stay there, right? So, you know, that's some of the things we're tossing around. What is the  what is a viable scenario to apply? But that kind of thing, they're gonna be really impacted in East Honolulu because all those rich homes on the coast, especially in Kuliʻouʻou and that area, that's really the hot spot of the  of the sea level rise, so  but those are, you know, 80 years, 50 to 80 years away.
Okay, thank you very much. Any  any other questions, Commissioners? Is there anybody in the boardroom or on the public that has a question for Barry or Abbey?
One last thing, the 170 gallons per capita, you're taking the total use and dividing it by the population?
Yeah, sir.
And those are really like apples and oranges. If you're talking about 
The golf course.
the big users, and thenyou're talking about North Shore being really high, but there are very few people on the North Shore. 
Right.
So I think you need a better comparison. It's very deceptive, and I think  I think it's making East Honolulu look really bad when it's probably not the household users that are doing that.
Ayron has a 
I can see your points.
Ayron.
Chair, may I?
Yes, go ahead, Kaleo.
Well 
It's Ayron.
Oh, Ayron.
Ayron Strauch, a member of the public. (Laughter.) 
I just want to point out the  the issues with using an average is very misleading, as it's being pointed out. There are a lot of densely populated parts of East Honolulu  and I know because I live out there  that don't use much water for irrigating landscaping, and they don't own a pool. There are a few neighborhoods that are very less  is much less dense. I mean, homes on 30,000 square feet or more, and they have lavish landscaping, and they dohave swimming pools. And I'm happy to hear that there's a potentially, a new rate structure because there are neighbors of mine that are using 500 gallons per day or per person per day or more. And I think my house is down at 94; I just calculated it out, so I'm very happy about that. But the average doesn't necessarily tell the whole story. So, yes, thank you.
Okay.
Yeah. We have an inverted block rate for residential because there's an essential needs tier that's the lowest rate, and the higher  the more water you use, the higher the rate gets, so, you know, it's gonna get even higher with the  if they adopt the rates. The non-residential rate, though, is flat because of the big diversity in commercial and nonresidential uses, but they'll definitely feel it. You know, it's over $5. When I started, it was $1.77 per thousand; now it's like 5, 5.20. So, you know, it's just trying to  everything  all the costs are going up. And we realize that, you know, folks are being squeezed, too, at the grocery store and all of that, inflation and stuff, but anyway, those are the dynamics at work here. I think, though, they work towards more efficiency, you know, and the extent that we can help with our incentive program, it's called Water Sensible, you know, we can help to quicken that pace, so 
By the way, I want to offer my four rain barrels in Kahalu'u to anybody in East O'ahu since it's always overflowing, and we don't need them.  
Great.  
Take him up on it, Barry. Take him up on it. Okay.  
I have one last  sorry.  
Yes, go ahead.  
As a renter, I would be really interested in understanding how the board considers renters who don't see a water bill, who may not be incentivized to conserve, and so if  and given the  like I don't know what the population that rents is, you know, like making sure that that kind of maybe is more directly communicated versus via jacking up rents. You know, that people can be engaged and aware. All of my students if I ask them how many of them pay a water bill, none of them raise their hands. So, you know, just really connecting to the population that rents that doesn't  that doesn't understand the (inaudible).  
Yeah, it's an ongoing challenge. It's the hard-to-reach customers that are renters that don't see the bill.  
Yeah. 
(Inaudible.) We're ramping up social media and all of that and trying to hit  you know, get to them, but it's challenging. 
Chair, can I  can I just add something real quick? 
Yeah. 
Maybe for the commission to consider and then the board. So thanks for the presentation, Barry; it's always good to see how the board is kind of taking the lead on this ahupua'a model and the behaviors and values that go with it. But kind of similar to what Chair said, they kind of of totally don't exist in this East Honolulu Watershed Plan. There's just conflict between the value set of sustainable, self-sustaining communities when you see this massive transfer of water from outside their community into a community and then the high use. But just maybe something to consider, you know, as a  we are in a water management area, right, and the commission does  while we issue water use permits to the board as a  as a permittee, you  it is a tool that this commission has. And I'm curious from the board's perspective on strategies of managing and encouraging or even regulating conservation, whether or not that was considered in your planning process or something that you would recommend even the commission get involved. While the code says that we delegate to the board or the board  Department of WateSupply to manage their end uses if there's complications in seeing conservation, as kind of Chair mentioned, from those end users, is something that the commission should be considering in terms of its review of your water use permit to the board and/or those end users that are benefiting from that allocation? Just, you know, that's a policy or a strategy or a tool that I'm curious you've  whether you've considered. It obviously would put a potential restriction on you as the holder of the permit, but if there isn't an incentive or disincentive to change behavior, is that something that should be considered by this body?
Thank you for your comment, Kaleo. Maybe we can start with a presentation one day, informational, on our conservation program and all the different facets. You know, you're talking about certain tactics and incentives on how to do that. You know, we've been expanding it as much as we can. Maybe we can just start there and then maybe the  you know, there are gaps that you see or not fast enough or something, and we can kind of, you know, react to it or address that. I think we're doing quite a bit, but it's a matter of focus so that we focus on the high  high-water users and, you know, we can  you know, if the commission is also saying that they support and are, you know, expecting, you know, greater efficiency, that may  I don't know if that would move the needle, but at least start with where we're at now and where we think we're gonna go and  and if you folks are willing, we'd be happy to make a presentation.
Yeah. No, I think that's good. I think it's also just you come up with long-term strategies as part of this plan, right? And as a planner, 2100 may seem a long time away, but it's  it is far to see that reduction from 170 to 130 as a catalyst project. But in the interim, are there other strategies, tools that maybe this body can support the board in its implementation towards conservation effort, right? So, you know, we can have  and we probably should have that dialogue before this body so that we can understand what you're currently doing, what the ultimate goal is, and if there are additional tools that we can employ or support you with as the regulator, right, as the trustee of water here in this state. So thank you, thanks for the presentation.
Okay. Barry and Abbey and Franz, thank you so much. I think this was a great presentation, good  it was good information, so thank you. I think with that; we're gonna take a lunch break. It's 1:05. Are you guys okay with coming back at 1:30?
Yes.
Because there are two action itemsOkay. So we're gonna take a break, we're gonna take a lunch break, and we'll come back at 1:30. Thank you again, Barry and Abbey.
