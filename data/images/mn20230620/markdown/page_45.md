COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: -- cubic yards of excavation that's listed.

MR. EVANS: Yeah, so what -- what's happened with the stream bank is it's eroded into a near -- you know, it used to be at a -- at a sloping embankment, and now it's eroded to a near vertical condition. And replacement without doing a vertical wall, which we wanted to avoid doing a wall, is -- we sloped it at the maximum possible gradient that we could, and that is what's required in -- bringing in a fill to sort of replace what -- what has been lost from past erosion. Does that answer your question?

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: So, no. Well, the material that's being excavated, Forestry is concerned about vectoring pathogens, so would that material be reused in sort of reconstruction of the embankment, or are you gonna store it on site, or what's the -- how are you going to handle that?

MR. EVANS: That is a -- I would expect that the material wouldn't be removed from the site, that it would be -- whatever is excavated would be reused on-site, so I don't -- I'm not sure what the -- how to better answer that.

Gwen, would you have anything to add on that one? It's more of a biological kind of question.

MS. RIVERA: In terms of the -- the placement of the excavated material?

MR. EVANS: Yes.
