Dean Uyeno, CWRM Stream Protection and Management Branch
Mr. Uyeno stated the summary of request stands on its written submittal and read the staff’s recommendations as noted in the submittal.
Okay Ms. Ho‘opi‘i, I'm not too sure if you've heard the previous conversation, the discussion. But did you want to add anything?
Aloha Chair Chang and Commissioners. Well, I first want to express, thank you to Rebecca for all the help that she has given. My family has come from Wai‘ehu since before the time of the Mahele. I have also submitted in my application a verification from OHA stating that they verified the genealogical tie to the original awardee or the property, the kuleana property. And we've been growing taro on that land for generations. The water did initially come direct from north Wai‘ehu Stream and was severed because of vandalism and other things that took place. If you're asking, can you please remind me what you're needing me to comment on related to Wes and Jodie's?
No, well this one is more on yours. We're deciding to take the two matters together since they seem to have similar issues raised by both you know Mr. Chumbley as well as Mr. Geiger regarding the potential impacts to the PUC compliance and then second it was you know, providing, we were looking at providing a deferral until that legal question can be addressed. The consultation with PUC to ensure there's no adverse impact.
So, I think that's the issue is, okay, well, one, we're contemplating a deferral for 30 days to permit staff to meet with PUC to coordinate under the MOU. And are you comfortable or have any objections to that?
I find that just a little bit hard to answer simply because I'm not aware of what the MOU is or the PUC requirements are. We have been waiting a while for the water and so I was hoping that it could be approved pending the PUC follow-up, but I guess I would have to defer to the Commission to make that decision.
You know I appreciate that. I'm sorry, if you have access to our website Wailuku Water Company’s testimony, I believe, was submitted and you can see what their concerns are. They're not necessarily saying that they have an objection to the use or the water but it's the process. That there is this, they have a PUC order, we have this MOU with, you know, the Water Commission. Wailuku Water Company and PUC and we may need to coordinate with PUC to ensure that we’re not putting Wailuku Water Company in jeopardy so that we can move forward.
Understood, which is why I'm saying I’ll leave it to the Commission. I don't have one way or the other because the approval and all the forwarding approvals need to come from the Commission. So, if that’s what needs to be done, yeah.
I greatly appreciate this because I think Mr. Chumbley said if we do proceed forward, it is likely that they will request a contested case hearing. Okay Mrs. Ho‘opi‘i, Mr. Mundy’s hand is up, but I'm going to provide you an opportunity. Do you have anything else you want to add?
I don’t think at this time, thank you. Chair Chang: Okay, thank you. Mr. Mundy, your hand is up.
Thank you, Chair. I wanted to and if I’m wrong please correct me, Michelle, but as I understand it the water distribution to that property was actually previously, has already been approved. And they’re just requesting that it be restored. So, if it was already approved would that even make it an issue for the PUC Commission? Because again it’s not adding to the draw, it’s using, it’s restoring an already approved draw that has been in place for I believe before Michele's, passed generationally to her and her portion of the family. And again if I’m wrong please correct me, Michele, but that would seem to make it not a PUC issue and maybe not even in line with our application.
Actually, okay so I was, my family was not part of the Na Wai ‘Eha case because we already had water coming to the property. Both where I'm asking and both on the other side of Malaihi Road. The problem is that the ditch was severed, cutting off our water to the property. So, I’m a new user not even related to anything that the Na Wai ‘Eha case was related to.
Thank you, thank you.
Commissioners, do you have any questions? Larry?
I guess a couple. If it’s a new use then we still, still falls under the concerns that I previously expressed. The second part is that looking at Ho‘opi‘i’s application, it would have from my standpoint, met what I quote-unquote call the old standard of what T&C is. But what I'm concerned is that whether the analysis was done assuming that the new standard on the D&O was used and I’m worried that if that is so, if the Supreme Court looks at this issue and raises it and changes it, whether it would affect our approval of their permit. So that even though I look at it and say, “looks to me like it’s a slam dunk case, they have both appurtenant rights and T&C rights,” but if the Commission made its decision under what is the new standard of T&C I’m just worried about the legality of it.
Yes, Mrs. Ho‘opi‘i?
I wanted to add, the water used to come through from north Wai‘ehu Ditch through Maniania Ditch and the plantation at that time, there was a diversion to have the water redirected up towards how white pipe is running. So, from the sugar plantation to Wailuku Ag to Wailuku Water Company, that's the course of where the water was flowing. So those are the entities that had to redirect our water to the property. So, Wailuku Water Company is just a lead from the past previous entity owners so we technically was still getting water through Wailuku Water Company, Wailuku Sugar. So, it's not like we're a brand new user. We've been having water to the property from way back Mahele time. And just to give more clarification the property is in conveyance to me from that LCA awardee to my tutu, to my tutu, to my tutu, my mom and then me and my other siblings. So, what I'm saying is that we've had existing water to the property since before the time of the Mahele. It's only because it's been severed at the point of white pipe that we now do not have water. We've had continuous water up until 2014.
You’re entitled to water based upon your relationship to this land and as you have historically, your family has exercised traditional and customary practices so the fact that the water isn't running and you're trying to restore that. But you have an independent right as a traditional and customary practice.
Yes, but I'm wanting to make clear that I'm not technically a new user.
Right, right. I appreciate the point of clarification. I think that and you know quite frankly if you can assert a traditional and customary practice, that is a pre- existing right that runs with the land. But I am curious to see the intersect between PUC, the Water Commission under this MOU because I'm having a hard time seeing how the PUC can trump our jurisdiction, but it may just be a matter of coordination and it may just be a matter of consultation. I am concerned that if we proceed forward, we've got an indication that there will be a contested case hearing which will put us into a much more protracted process versus giving us 30 days to see if we can do the PUC consultation to confirm that we have the right to proceed forward on these permits.
Yeah, can I just add for clarification? In the conversations with PUC in the development of the MOU, they made it very clear that they're not the experts on water rights and that they defer all of those decision making to this body. And that a lot of times in sequencing, which is also tied to kind of a decision in Nā Wai ‘Ehā , they basically put a hold on the CPCN until the decision was made by this body in order to determine whether appurtenant rights or other water rights still existed or granted. And then they would act on the application or the docket before them. It's just a sequencing issue more so than I think a jurisdictional issue has been framed, but again we are supportive of kind of clarifying that and getting and maybe even having the PUC present or staff here to answer any questions this body may have in a future decision making on these two items.
Yeah, I appreciate it. If Mr. Chumbley and Mr. Geiger weren't on the call asserting that they may file a contested case hearing, I'd be real comfortable with just going with that. But I mean I think moving cautiously I mean that's kind of what I'm thinking. Mr. Geiger your hand is up?
Yes, Chair. Thank you very much. I know we're not entitled and have no right to do this, but again in the spirit of cooperation to the extent that if the Commission decides to defer for consultation I think it would be helpful if a representative of Wailuku Water Company could be in the room so that we could have our questions answered and feel comfortable with whatever coordination is adopted by the Commissions.
If I can. Mahalo, Jim for the request. You can make the requests; I will say that because you are a party before the PUC oftentimes in our conversations directly with the PUC they cannot have conversation with you as a regulator. So that's where the MOU came into play and where we were trying to agency to agency look at policy and jurisdictional issues. So, I will make the request, but having you as a party with a docket that's open, they're really reluctant having this ex-parte communications with you or with somebody in the room. So totally understand the operational issues. Let us take the first step and then hopefully we'll have findings from those conversations and then if it's possible to bring you in and other parties that may have standing in that conversation, we’ll do so.
Appreciate that, thank you.
Avery, your hand is up. Oh, you're muted.
It keeps muting itself. I guess you don't want to hear me. Thank you, Chair. Deputy, I would note that it's not ex-parte communication if the PUC attorneys are present and our PUC attorney would be present. Then as long as both of those are there then it would be appropriate. Mr. Geiger is not our PUC attorney. Doug Codiga in Honolulu at Schlack Ito is the PUC attorney so without having us involved in the discussion to be able to raise the issues, I think we would be missing a lot of the critical points that need to be deliberated on. Thank you.
Nope, you raise a good point, but what we'll do Avery, we'll make the request and it'll be up to them. They may want to have separate meetings, I don't know, but I think...
You may want your Deputy Attorney General, Julie, there too.
Okay, so with that being said, do I have any other questions? We're having a real nice free-flowing conversation, so any Commissioners do you have any further questions, comments? Do I have a motion? Hōkūao, I'm gonna let you one more time before we make a motion. Go ahead.
Sorry, I didn't have a chance to speak.
Oh, I'm sorry. You're right, my apologies to you.
Mahalo, Chair. I just again wanted to go on record that Hui o Nā Wai ʻEhā is in support of Ho‘opi‘i ‘‘ohana’s request for a water use permit and any assistance that they need, additional assistance that they may need we're waiting to support. I also did want to note that I did but I didn't specify in my testimony prior to this which I was going to repeat on this particular docket was just one particular concern. Again, this is probably kind of moot at this point because it looks like both items will be deferred but I did again want this to be on the record that just one of the concerns that we had not necessarily with the applicant but pertaining to the source. And it's been our understanding, our organization’s understanding that over the last two to three years water use permitting specifically in Waihe‘e and Wai‘ehu have not been receiving adequate flow amounts from both sources which includes the Waihe‘e and Spreckels Ditch based on the total amount allocated to users. I believe CWRM staff is well aware of some of these challenges especially specifically to the south Waihe‘e kuleana ‘auwai via the Spreckels Ditch. Again, that's not necessarily pertinent to this however, there are some similar challenges based off the Waihe‘e Ditch system. So, we just ask that the Commission staff continue to support, you know, and having staff maybe come out continue to measure some of these sources not only for the different kuleana ditch and ‘auwai intakes, but also from the main source for which these traditional systems connect to. You know we can be giving water away all day or at least approving water, but if it isn’t available then really these don’t mean anything right? So, I just wanted to put that on record on behalf of Hui o Nā Wai ʻEhā, again that we support the Ho‘opi‘i ‘ohana and the Mundys and that there are some source challenges as well. And hopefully that we can get that rectified at some point, mahalo.
Thank you very much for that, Hōkūao. With that being said, Aurora did you want to make a formal motion to defer?
I had a question first that earlier there was some discussion about going into executive session. Do we need to?
I think with your decision to defer, you've covered pretty much everything. Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani: Is 30-days sufficient, Kaleo?
We'll work with staff to try to expedite this and bring it back as expeditiously as possible. Because it involves another agency we’re also on their time schedule as well, but we’ll relay the urgency to try to bring it back in time for September.
Do we need to set a date, a time or can we say until such time as, you know, this meeting has occurred?
Yeah, I mean I don't mind keeping the pressure on especially for the families who have been waiting. So, this puts us, the onus is on now on us to move this matter along and if you need additional time you can come back to us and ask for a deferral, but we will try to have. And you know those of you on Maui you just really can appreciate how that you know Maui's becoming a priority for so many other things. So, we're going to, staff is going to try their best to meet this deadline within 30 days coming back and bringing this matter after consulting with PUC. Okay?
MOTION: (KAGAWA-VIVIANI / HANNAHS) To defer items B-2 and B-3 for 30 days to permit Commission staff to coordinate with Public Utilities Commission staff and address questions raised. UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED (MIIKE/KATAYAMA/HANNAHS/CHANG/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/MEYER)
