There. So that message was communicated to East Honolulu. What we got back was like, "Hey, we're conserving, you know, and -- well, yeah, but you can conserve more."

We have a rebate program for rain barrels; the stormwater utility is going -- they're very interested in green infrastructure and trying to recharge the aquifer too. So the community there is very surprising; they're very motivated and very active in their activities around the coast and in these cultural sites and, you know -- more so than I see in other communities, too.

It's just the big users like, I think, Commissioner Hannahs was talking about it, and Chair was talking about, and, you know, we can -- we can probably talk to them and see how that can be resolved. They tried developing sources. It's all salty aquifer water, so it's not irrigatable. But anyway, this is what we've done so far.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Sorry, a follow-up quick question asking -- remind me, the Board of Water Supply is a member of the watershed partnerships?

MR. USAGAWA: Yes. The Ko'olau Mountain Watershed Partnerships, yes.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Yeah. And does that mean financial, like, support --

MR. USAGAWA: Yes.
