Briefing Summarizing Select Legislation of Note Related to the Commission on Water Resource Management from 2023-2024 Legislative Biennium
Staff shared the status of House and Senate bills relating to or directly affecting CWRM.
If I could just add to that. I didn’t want, knowing that the bill is from last year, and that the counties subsequently did raise concerns to the Governor about this. I met with the county as well as Chair Ichiyama encouraged and I told her that I was going to meet. I’ve met with the county, all the water departments. It was great conversation. I think we’re going to try to do this on a regular basis, meeting with the county water departments. I think that their opposition was more...because I said nobody opposed the bill during the hearing. Let me just put it this way, I think that they were and I’m not going to speak on behalf of the counties, they appreciated the outreach. I think they were more comfortable with an incremental increase rather than going up to the $60,000. I said, okay we will decrease it to $25,000 and I’m hoping that that will be a more acceptable compromise with the county water departments.
Was the Governor’s veto based on the counties’ objection? I mean he’s the big elephant in the room right now.
That’s my understanding. That’s why I said I will reach out to the county water department because I don’t want to waste people’s time if it’s going to be vetoed again but I think that was my guidance. Talk to the county water departments because that’s where the objection came from.
LURF (Land Use Research Foundation) and the Hawaiʻi DWS (Department of Water Supply), I think in the initial hearing, Kauaʻi County had also provided testimony and subsequently I think only Hawaii Department of Water Supply and Honolulu Board of Water Supply had some testimony along with LURF and others. You may want to take a look at those testimony to see where their positions are.
Let me ask you, what is the objection to a high penalty?
I think the way the Code and the Bill points out is that it’s a daily fine. So, it could conceivably, theoretically end up at these high million-dollar fines right. We tend to work with the counties whenever we notice something or something happens with the wells. We measure on a 12-month moving average. We certainly work with even the counties and private purveyors whenever we’re setting instream flow standards. We try to work with them as much as possible.
What kinds of violations are we talking about?
Could be anything, over-pumping, not meeting the instream flow standard. But in a lot of cases, especially like the instream flow standards. Understanding our staff and understanding how measurements take place and the difficulties in getting out to intakes, it’s difficult to accurately measure and maintain an instream flow standard especially when the weather is changing daily. We’re more apt to work with the diverters in those cases than to come down heavy with a fine, but if it’s a continued violation that we see and they’re not listening to our staff then that’s when we’ll tend to take an action.
In addition to a penalty, can you take away? For example, if they have a well can we shut it down or if you’re doing a diversion, can we cut it off? That’s within the power of the Commission, right?
I think it’s possible. That may constitute a takings action that we would have to bring before the Commission.
It seems to me that if you have a violator who doesn’t care about what the fine is and they keep on violating, but it every day there’s a fine...
Alexa did an analysis of all of our violations, to a large extent, we’re not into punishment as we are into mitigation, do something and move. A lot of the violations have turned into mitigation measures but I think it is helpful to have a stick if you don’t get compliance, so looking at alternative ways to get people in compliance. I think for the objections to the $60,000 was we went from $5,000 all the way up to $60,000 even though we showed a real good rational basis. It was consistent with DOH, it followed EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). I think there was just suspicion, I will be very candid. I think there was just suspicion of CWRM’s intention so I said okay, we’ll do it incrementally.
I’ll give up my shirt.
I’m hoping with better coordination with the county water departments, I suspect we will never change LURF’s mind, but the county water departments, I think we are trying to be much more collaborative with them and talk about these, in particular legislation, ahead of time and I should have spoken to them earlier. I’m hoping that this one will proceed forward.
If I could just add to this. I’m not too sure if you recall at the same time as Red Hill there was a WAI, Water Alliance Initiative. It was a coordinated effort between state and county agencies and governments with respect to the remediation of the Red Hill, not to circumvent or in any way to intervene with existing regulatory processes, either by DOH or EPA, but more to supplement. The WAI report asks for more than what DOH could do. It includes research but it also looked at an ecosystem approach to remediation and so I think the determination was that DLNR (Department of Land and Natural Resources) was in the better position to oversee the coordination of this effort to implement the WAI initiative. That’s why it’s being placed in DLNR with some capacity.
If I can just add to this one. I was trying not to take this personal but I thought this might have been the anti-Chair Chang Bill, but nonetheless that was my caution to the legislators is not to change the organizational structure of CWRM in response to an incident but make sure that it is done in a very thoughtful way. Let me share from my perspective, I see CWRM as an integral part of DLNR. I’m really looking at how do I manage mauka to makai, how do I look at ecosystem water resources, how do I look at ecosystem management. CWRM is an integral component of those discussions internally with other DLNR divisions, separate and apart from the regulator, and the expertise that they bring. To take them out of DLNR and to truly make them a totally independent agency would in my mind...we miss the opportunity to do true indigenous resource management. That’s why we have comments, we have opposition, and we have support for various components of this measure, but it is moving through the legislature so if any of you have got any comments, I’d welcome that, but otherwise that was some of the thought process that went into our testimony.
I wouldn’t support that bill. I think it has too many changes and it’s basically a reaction to what controversy was when some of us opposed, but I won’t comment on all of it. One of the things is that to make a chairperson from one of the appointed areas, you and I know that chairperson is not just a figurehead position. It takes a lot of energy and I don’t see how any one of us would have the energy or the commitment to be the chairperson and be that involved. For that reason alone, I would oppose it. As far as the conflicts of interest, I think the current laws are adequate. We don’t need that, but anyway, for what it’s worth, I wouldn’t support this.
Don’t worry, they put those takes effect on those dates just to keep the bill alive, but if it moves forward that’s just a placeholder. They’ll change it should the bill move forward.
I think that was Land Division, they were much more concerned. They thought that was going to be transferred to Land Division. I said I don’t think that’s the intention. I think the intention is possibly to transfer these over to the county water departments. We have amended our testimony to provide more comments because I think we do support the counties having management over the water infrastructure.
If that goes through, the part about the executive director, how is the executive director appointed?
They would have to be approved by the Commission.
Right now, Dawn would pick someone and then we would approve. I think some of the executive offices like Office of AG (Attorney General) is the Governor that reports.
I don’t know. Chair may have some based on the KIRC, Kahoʻolawe Island Reserve Commission. I think it would be similar in nature to that.
I think the way that that’s done is the Commission actually they do their own solicitation and they hire so it’s not even someone from either the Governor or the Chairperson, the Commission on its own. A truly administrative attached agency like KIRC and like Mauna Kea Authority, they are totally independent. They have their own office, they have their own staff but they select their own executive director.
They still rely on the personnel services, fiscal services of the Department.
At DLNR, we provide HR and fiscal support but they are truly independent. CWRM is a little on the hybrid side. They’re not truly independently attached. I’d like to say the best of both worlds, some say the worst of both worlds. I don’t know, depends upon which way you sit, but there would be a distinction in the administration if they are truly administratively attached like KIRC and Mauna Kea.
I would have preferred keeping the way it is but clarifying that if we approve hiring, we also approve firing.
Fair enough. I don’t have an objection to having the first deputy be an executive director that’s not politically appointed that could be appointed by the Commission. It’s essentially an exempt position, but they’re not subject to change of administration.
Then the other part would have been like in the past that we would be able to get independent counsel but only under certain circumstances when there’s clearly a conflict. Right now, the Attorney General can say no and that’s the end of it, even though from my standpoint there was a clear conflict like the original Waiāhole case. I think the court was pretty spot on with saying if there’s a conflict then you should have [inaudible]. But if there’s a conflict but there was no way around it, for example when Michael was in your position, DLNR was a party in it and then he was also the Chair over it. In a situation like that he can stay on because there’s no resolution in other words. I would have preferred it that.
There are some agencies that they do have authority to hire their own attorney and I think that the way that this provision is drafted, the AGs did oppose that. There are certain circumstances where there is a clear conflict of interest.
I believe just to address your concern, this bill authorizes the Commission to annually evaluate the executive director’s work, so basically can hire and fire them.
What are the chances of these bill’s going through?
It’s moving notwithstanding. My sentiment is if you’re going to reorganize CWRM, make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons not in response to an incident because I will share with you, there’s tremendous value having CWRM part of the Department. I bring them into meetings that we have like on this Maui temp housing. They wouldn’t come into those meetings, they’d have to wait till there’s a regulatory process, a permit that comes to them. But in situations where we’re looking at watershed management and impacts on nearshore waters, CWRM participates in those discussions. I find them to be an integral part of the overall. If we’re looking at a truly ecosystem-based management, an ahupuaʻa-based management, they need to be at the table during the planning process not at the purely regulatory process. I see CWRM as being more proactive in that role, but if they become a regulator and administratively attached, that opportunity wouldn’t be available to us as it is now. That’s my manaʻo on that one.
It creates this Red Hill remediation special fund. The intention is that the State is going to Congress and we have spoken to our Congressional delegates about providing additional funds specifically for Red Hill remediation and those funds would be placed into this special fund to be managed to implement the WAI initiatives.
I just wanted to quickly address the comment about House Bill 2703 which is also relevant to Senate Bill 3327. I don’t think either bill is an anti-Dawn Chang bill, it’s about giving the Water Commission independence and it finally implements the 30-year-old review Commission recommendations. As I’m sure this Commission is aware a lot of these bills seek to implement recommendations of a Review Commission report issued in 1994 in the same initiative that created the Water Code. A Review Commission was established to perform a comprehensive review of the State Water Code five years after its enactment and a seven-member commission held multiple public information meetings, public hearings throughout the state and 30 years ago it issued a 200 plus page report with recommendations for improving the Water Code. Fast forward 30 years, for people working on water issues for generations, it’s heartening to see that finally there’s a potential for these Review Commission recommendations to come to fruition with the goal being to allow the Commission to act proactively and be free from political influence. I think that’s the driving force behind these proposals and so I just wanted to comment on that. Also, to comment on the statement Dean had made I think it was about SB 3327 and the ability to retain independent legal counsel. The comment about the AGs providing sound and timely advice to the Commission, we did review the testimony that was submitted on that bill and the irony of the Department of the Attorney Generals taking the position that this Commission shouldn’t be able to retain and consult independent legal counsel is remarkable, especially considering historically and recently the AGs have been wrong on the law. Respectfully, if you look at the AG’s track record on appeal in this area, they’ve lost every case and this has caused a multitude of problems for the Commission. The fact that the Commission is getting bad advice is part of the problem. The AG’s testimony on this bill also is case in point for why the Commission’s ability to consult independent legal counsel is so important. That testimony made multiple misstatements of law including that commercial ag was a public trust purpose that was squarely addressed by the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court in the Waiāhole Case and wrote the exact opposite of what the AG is claiming. I think that it’s important for this Commission to be able to consult independent legal counsel in situations and that bill also just gives the Commission the flexibility to do that when necessary. That’s all I wanted to comment on this briefing. Thank you.
Wayne Tanaka of Sierra Club of Hawaiʻi. I just want to say this is awesome. I really think getting briefings like this is something that more boards and commissions should be doing especially since you’re essentially relying on the administration to advocate on bills that could impact your ability to fulfill your kuleana. I’m also glad to see that we are aligned on many measures including the penalties bill. I did want to note for that bill HB 1544, the stated justification last was that increased penalties would somehow result in the max penalty being automatically levied on county departments of water supply and then that would impact housing security. To be frank that was just ridiculous and non-credible fear mongering. The Commission has almost never pursued penalties except against egregious violations and the express language of the bill requires the Commission to consider a whole range of factors in fine amounts. The fear mongering from LURF that the Governor unfortunately listened to was not grounded in legal and political reality. And just for perspective, right now with your $5,000 a day maximum penalty a violation involving just five MGD (million gallons per day) would be subject to a max fine of 1/10th of one cent per gallon. Obviously this needs to change if there are bad actors that are recalcitrant and don’t want to stop violating the Water Code. We are looking forward to supporting the Water Commission as you advocate in support of this bill and there’s a lot of community support for this measure as well. I did want to add a couple things about HB 2703 and SB 3327 which is the bill that Elena from Earthjustice just talked about. It would basically democratize the Water Commission’s leadership and sets some employment protections for staff and it’s absolutely not personal to Chair Chang. It really has been a long time coming for 30 years from before Waiāhole. It’s been a long-standing recommendation and it would help protect the Commission and its staff from both the perception of political influence as well as awkwardness of balancing public trust mandates with other less substantive considerations. The public trust needs to be independently and objectively upheld and the Commission would be able to speak clearly and act objectively with some of the insulation that these measures would provide including at the legislature and without having to worry about certain special interests with political influence such as LURF without exposing the Governor and his administration to political liability. Just want to express my gratitude to Chair for agendizing this item and I’m happy to answer any other questions that the Commission may have. Thank you.
Aloha, I’d just like to underscore one point that the Sierra Club just made with respect to the penalties bill. I think a lot of the focus has been around the departments of water supply because they along with LURF led to the bill being killed last year, but I do want to uplift what the Sierra Club mentioned. This bill is very important to a lot of communities, especially in Maui Komohana for example, where we have had repeated violations of the interim instream flow standards and where even the Commission’s own staff has struggled with diverters to try and have the law fulfilled. The ability for the Commission to be able to implement maximum penalties doesn’t necessarily mean that it will and as we all know I’ve been appearing before the Commission for more than 20 years now, we’ve seen huge fines in only a small handful of cases and I trust the staff in the Commission to be able to work with that. Mahalo to Chair Chang for negotiating that agreement with the departments. I would note that the initial $60,000 recommendation would make this the same as DOH. $25,000 is much better than $5,000, but I also think there’s no harm in standing by the $60,000. Mahalo for this briefing and for the work that your staff has been doing on the Commission. It’s been heavy at the legislature, it’s been a big lift.
I have a question as somebody who doesn’t, but probably should track legislation more carefully. Both House Bill 2703 and SB 3327, do they say that the DLNR chair cannot chair or just that other officials can?
Specifically says is ineligible to serve as a chairperson. So DLNR Chair and DOH Chair, we only serve as ex-officio.
I’m just going to admit my ignorance in public here. You submit in support or opposition but what is the ability for the Commission to weigh on revisions or direct that?
You are always free to provide your own testimony as an individual. That was part of the briefing is one, to provide you an update of the legislation. There’s a lot of legislation but so that because some of these things are relevant to some of the issues we discussed previously regarding Maui. It’s also to get an inclination because we do represent the Commission as well. I didn’t want to, in particular SB 3327 and House Bill 2703, the whole reorganization of CWRM. For me it’s important, I am just but one Commissioner so I am interested to hear if any of the other Commissioners have any thoughts about this. Then it can fashion our collective testimony as well.
There’s a lot packed into it. And also understanding how the companion bills may move.
They’re not totally companion, but they have similar provisions.
What I appreciate is this briefing at this point in the year because I think in the past it’s been afterwards and it’s like, oh maybe we could have weighed in or said something.
This was intentional.
We should be able to find the testimony that staff submitted.
Status and you can also sign up to be notified when a hearing is coming up.
You can always ask us but if you go on the legislative website and you put in these bills you can find it.
This is a really, I think, a helpful rundown and also understanding of the rationale.
There’s a little more breathing room. Michael Yoshinaga who used to be part of the Commission staff, retired at the end of last year and divisions have been tasked to take on their own review of all the bills. That was a huge lift and thank you to Alexa, especially, for helping to review that and Neal and Nicholas on his team and Ryan Imata for reviewing the bills. Initially we were tracking 150 bills, fortunately we didn’t have to testify on all of them but at least monitoring many of them. We’re still monitoring a bunch but primarily testifying on these that you see before you.
As well as processing permits. A lot of this, from what I understand, is motivated by that 1994 report. I guess some things are still problematic and some things may not be anymore and I would wonder about staff’s take on that ‘94 report. Just weighing in on that.
I mean we certainly would be happy to send it out to you folks to take a look at. Personally, I haven’t had a chance to review it yet, it’s on my list of things to do.
When did you start at the Commission? I’m just wondering. Before that?
It would be interesting to see, as this is your job, to see how much of that could make sense.
There have been several reviews. I think there was one ‘78 prior to the Code. That one was already envisioning water shortage issues occurring on Oʻahu and Maui. That was one that Alexa had found. There was a ‘94 one and one other one, I thought.
1985, that was the Advisory Commission report to draft the Water Code, but that was the drafting of the water code itself.
In reviewing the bills, she went back and found these documents and took a look at them. We can forward them out to you folks.
In mind there’s been a lot of court decisions that have really provided us those additional guidance on public trust principles. The whole implementation of Ka Paʻakai, so in my mind a lot of the issues that were raised in that report have been addressed. Some of them may not have been but I think that time has changed. Alexa’s also going through a rule amendment review because we haven’t amended the Water Code since its original adoption and that’s 1987.
The rules haven’t been amended, the Code has.
Right. She’s really putting a lot of effort into that. There’s a lot on CWRM’s plate, they’re trying to juggle a lot of things but I think having guidance from the Commission and for me, that’s what’s important. I’m only but one Commissioner so whether it’s Maui temp housing or whether it’s bills, I think it’s important to provide the Water Commission an opportunity to weigh on some of these. These are policies. In my mind, the Commission drives policy, staff implements our policies so some of these legislation, it is a change to policy. I think it is important if you have thoughts about that, let us know. They are important.
I would appreciate it if the staff, when these bills come up, let us know about it because we might want to testify as an individual. I certainly would have wanted to do that at some point.
We’ll do that.
May I ask that you sign up on the website for email notice? Only because we’re tracking a lot of bills. If you tell us which one specifically, we might be able to let but oftentimes we’ll get 48-hours’ notice to submit testimony. Testimony has to be within 24 hours.
Usually that’s the case really short terms. 
I think you can do that on the website, right?
Send us the link with some instructions. I had to remember my login.
It’s just enter your email and then you have to select the bills that you want to track.
Is this week lateral?
Lateral just happened last week Friday.
A lot of the bills are going to whittle down so we will know this week what survives. Again, a lot is also happening, there’s a huge briefing that’s going on at the legislature. It may be pau by now before WAM (Senate Ways and Means) Finance committee on Maui. A lot of things are in flux, in motion and legislation is one of them. There’s just a lot going on.
I for one, when I was active, hated legislative session because they always expected us to be there even though we weren’t needed.
You’re right, there is an expectation and it’s very difficult both to physically be present as well as maintain the operation. We have a new First Deputy Ryan Kanakaʻole. Ryan is a former AG. Ryan’s task is primarily legislation so that’s been very helpful in reviewing leg(islature). The fact that we’ve changed now, all of the divisions are required to review all of the bills. It’s really given everybody this holistic approach to how even bills that were not necessarily admin bills because CWRM has no admin bills but as you can see there are a lot of bills that affect them. This has been a full court press with each of the divisions to dedicate the time and the resources to one, stay up with legislation. Also, our budget, as well as responding to legislators but at the same time they have to keep the daily operations of their division moving forward. It’s a lot. I appreciate this staff, CWRM has got unbelievable staff. The professionalism, the work, their work ethics, the values that they bring, I’ve really appreciated CWRM staff.
