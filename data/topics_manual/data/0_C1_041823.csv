Informational Briefing on the Pacific Drought Knowledge Exchange by Dr. Ryan Longman, University of Hawai‘i
Mr. Neal Fujii of the CWRM Planning Branch introduced Dr. Ryan Longman, with the University of Hawai‘i and a fellow at the East-West Center, and an associate researcher at the Water Resource Research Center at UH.
Dr. Ryan Longman provided a slide presentation on an overview of The Pacific Drought Knowledge Exchange (PDKE). It was framed within the context of the data life cycle, which includes data monitoring, processing, storage, access, analysis, product creation, and dissemination. It encompasses many of these elements. (Slide presentation attached.)
are you coordinating or is the school of public health interested in your research and the effects climate change has on public health and the environment?
it’s an open research question. I’m sure there’s an interest in that. I’m not particularly working with anybody in public health but it’s certainly an area to explore and certainly something that they might be able to utilize.
as you were going through this, I was thinking this is something that we could probably use.
It’s just a matter of identifying the type of data needed and getting it to the people that need it.
thank you Dr. Longman and his team saying that his presentation was the most precise, accessible presentation ever heard from the University of Hawai‘i. I have never seen or was aware of many of those products. I have one question and one comment for future potential work for them. The question is: I know these are based on certain climatic models. What's the plan to verify the models and update some of the existing fact sheets that you have? And the comment is: a future need that we have, and it really relates to an issue we're dealing with today is the commission has really looked at some of these large episodic storm events as opportunities for our dams and reservoirs for water storage, but we do lack sometimes is the actual science that can kind of predict the amounts of some of these episodic storm events that can help us do some of the financial analysis to really help the majority of private landowners to see if they can maintain these dead dams and reservoirs. Episodic storm events are hard to model but that is one data element that as you look for future needs, I know the Water Commission could really use. Thank you for a great presentation and great work.
to the comment first, saying with the Mesonet coming online. This is data that is available in five-minute resolution. We may not be able to predict what’s going to happen in the future but can get a really good idea of how much rainfall the storms are bringing to the island now once they have that high-resolution data. I think that that could be a model for what could happen in the future. If you can determine how storms might change you can base it on the information that you have but until they have that really high temporal resolution data. The second, that Mesonet station gets installed, and they have about 20 installed right now they start using that data. They start pulling it into the portal in real-time with data acquisition and product development. In terms of the question, a lot of the products and they’re developing like the rainfall maps, and temperature maps are all work that they’ve spent years on. They have been working on the Hawai‘i climate data portal for a decade and conceptually for two decades. If you go back to Tom’s (Thomas Giambelluca) tenure probably 4 decades, I don’t want to date Tom too much, but it’s been a while so the work that they do, and the mapping they publish that in peer viewed scientific journals. The future projections is not on their shop it’s on the periphery and can only use what’s out there so when folks develop something they make use of it but it’s just a matter of more folks putting their head down and looking into the future and then us utilizing and leveraging their efforts to get that information to folks in Hawai‘i.
(thanked Dr. Longman for the presentation saying it was excellent) I was struck by your data utilization and your data life cycle slide. But there was something missing from that. You get to dissemination and what I was looking for was data utilization. Once we have the information what do we do with it? I think it’s really important and that’s why I said the implications which may not be so much on you as so much on our DLNR leadership and so forth that we recognize how then do we take this and have sounder policies. Then I looked at your models, your co-production models which I appreciate are better than the other options that you presented before it. I guess we’re not just looking at the value of information for its own sake so that we can adapt to here’s the trajectory and here is where we will end up so here’s how we’re going to live. I think part of our job is to really optimize, develop optimal strategies and move us toward a strategic optimization model. So that we’re again sensibly taking the information we have and making better policies. What comes back to Commissioner Buck is we just read in the paper Civil Beat today and we’re thinking what do you do with one reservoir? Kalihiwai reservoir on Kaua‘i. We’re going to close another reservoir and there’s a big dispute over the investment value of that and who bears that investment. Those are great examples of how we need to take the information that you’re providing and really put it in the hands of policymakers and make better decisions that are informed by your science. I’m not sure if that’s a statement or a question but I’d really like some discussion on that from both you as well as our staff.
(Thanked Commissioner Hannahs). I often get this question. My capacity is at a limit when it gets to that dissemination point considering all the things that I'm doing. But you want your data and your work to have value and I'm not in the Ivory Tower approach so when I get to the dissemination part you would hope that in the co-production model that you're actually creating something that somebody wants, and they will utilize it. I have gotten feedback from people like Sierra McDaniel at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park who has used the information to make restoration decisions on planting silver sword species and for managing invasive species during certain times of the year. I'm getting some anecdotal information from folks that are using it for in terms of the ranchers in Hawai‘i. The ranchers have to make decisions and what's going to happen is they're going to either make the decision with no information or they're going to make it based on some information that we provide them. I'm not telling them what to do but it's a piece of information they can have that they might not have access to on the other hand. I can say is that we want to create the data and information the most relevant information for folks to utilize and find out what they need and give it to them in a format they can use.
Ranching is a good example; you can look at your data in one decision you could adapt and reduce the stocking rate but when we have community goals to increase food production, we’ve got to take your data and figure out how do we have the stocking rate we want on our ranch lands that meet our food production goals and make sense with respect to the burden upon the land and the utilization of the resource. It’s not all your kuleana we need our public policy representatives in this to step forward.
No, I think the goal is to utilize the data both in short-term and long-term decision-making. Reflecting on our kuleana to manage permits for example and bring forward recommendations to the Commission to the extent that we have a robust data set to work off the better. The trends are what we’ve been most interested in from a long-term Hawai‘i Water Plan perspective and for you folks as decision-makers and policymakers to make decisions based on new relevant Hawai’i-specific data versus these larger climate models that we’ve been basing our decisions off of.
(thanked Dr. Longman) I have a question and then I have an offer. One, for the Hawai‘i Rangeland Information Portal which is super cool. Are you folks thinking about sort of intermediate range like two-to-three-year projections? I think that sometimes the scale at which decision-making happens; if you're going to manage head and all it's also like the El Niño kind of windows that are extremes that really swing decision-making. Three months is good, but I remember working in cattle country and that window of time was kind of important.
the ranchers that we've talked to and work with, Hawai‘i Cattleman’s Council. On a day-to-day management level, we're finding that they're interested in the short term mostly. But I think it's probably some larger planning thoughts as you're looking into developing in the future. The information is useful on that but I'm very careful, I'm not a modeler in terms of what I do so, it's an almanac perspective, it just says that this happened past El Niño, this is what happens on average. It’s a real kind of careful way to get into that space in terms of projections. Now we can show the data and talk about what happened yesterday, last month, and what we think is going to happen, but I don't know if I have the capabilities to move too far into the future. But if that information is available in a robust way, we're happy to provide it to anybody that wants it and put it into the portfolio. That is something that we can do on a gridded basis.
In that case, I have a follow-up or preceding question. Which is, you were talking about the data life cycle and about the knowledge exchange which I think kind of closed the loop. I noticed there was an arrow back, but we start with the kind of sensory data I think you and are very familiar with. But what room is there to include other indicators based on the feedback with stakeholders? Maybe we're not measuring the right things. Is there a way to incorporate those recommendations, maybe not in your project but are they documented and placed somewhere for the future? Maybe we're not measuring the right metrics that matter to the stakeholders.
The portfolio is something we can do for anybody. So, we make the portfolio, and the next step would be to sit down with the stakeholder and go through the portfolio and say here is the information that you need. What else can we provide for you there? Then the idea of the knowledge exchange is to document lessons learned to get any information we can and compile it into a centralized clearing house to create these drought needs assessments; these things that encapsulate the broader issues and maybe even specific issues that might be relevant to other folks. So, there is that part of the exchange also it's kind of bringing together information from individuals and putting it in a cohesive way where others can kind of learn from those lessons.
that's kind of where the incorporation of local knowledge comes in but it's not something you carry out. Is it just something you document?
it's more documenting and disseminating it to others that might be interested in that information.
Maybe as I sit on the commission for a couple more years, we can have more informal dialogues and think about ways that the continuing work of Hawaii Climate Data Portal (HCDE) and PDKE more directly guide commission work. This is focused on drought, but I think Dr. YinPhan Tsang, when we're thinking about extremes, she's doing a lot of work on flooding and there's going to be more work done on flooding. She works with folks on Kaua‘i as well so that would be a good complimentary informational briefing.
The Pacific drought knowledge exchange is not limited to drought information and will also include flooding information. A fire risk and warning tool is being funded at a high resolution by Sayed Bateni at the Water Resource Research Center. The goal of the HCDP is to achieve water balance for the state, which will incorporate information on rainfall, runoff, aquifer recharge, and evapotranspiration. Dr. YinPhan Sang is developing a gridded soil moisture product to allow for effective precipitation analysis. The ultimate goal of the HCDP is to provide a comprehensive water balance for the state, which will take a couple more years to achieve.
(thanked Dr. Longman for his work) I’ve been in the water and water management business for over 40 years. Your information is tremendously valuable to water utilities, public and private professionals, farmers, ranchers, and the public in terms of warning about drought and flood events. I feel that this work is filling a significant gap in the field and encourage you to continue the excellent work.
(thanked Dr. Longman for his presentation) This has helped me gain perspective. I’m interested in understanding the timing of climate cycles and how your research can help in long-term water balance decision making. Who are the decision makers that you work with in developing this model, and how do you determine which areas to focus on? Specifically, about whether high-risk or low-tolerance areas for weather swings are prioritized. Overall, I’m seeking to gain a better understanding of your work and how it can be applied to address climate change.
For the first question regarding whom they are working with on modeling projects, they take a stakeholder approach and work with those who are willing to collaborate with them. There is no specific targeting involved, and it is more about networking and the capacity to help. We can make a portfolio quickly for anyone. Overall, our approach is flexible and open to collaboration. 
who are the decision makers that you are collaborating with at these various sites that you've selected? Our collaboration partners vary depending on the project and location. We work with the resource management unit in Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park and individuals who manage land resources such as ranchers. We aim to work with people who will actually use the tools and data and try to identify them early on. I am currently working with the Hawai‘i Cattleman’s Council to meet with individuals who manage livestock and see if this tool can help them. We also work with organizations such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service, USGS, and Nature Conservancy, who put us in touch with the right people. It is really a grassroots project, and there is no specific model for identifying resource managers.
Your research, what is the window for climate trends?
the climate in Hawai‘i has crazy annual variability with wet and dry years. The last eight of nine years have been the hottest on record and the next El Niño could send temperatures off the charts. We’ve been in a La Niña for the last three years so we have not felt the full effects of what the atmosphere and the ocean is doing and the next El Niño could occur next winter and bring a hot and dry winter. Rainfall trends are uncertain, but temperatures are rising, and models predict a much warmer environment in Hawaii in the future. This will cause species, certain agricultural products, and people’s health and comfort to be at risk. Mitigation efforts are somewhat working, but we need to plan for a warmer world without any doubt.
well, I think that's a challenge for this group is how do we protect our water resources so we can continue to enjoy a healthy and vibrant lifestyle. So, I think this research is key. We really need to have the ability to make long-term decisions that will protect our future so hopefully, you can help us. There are a lot of (Commission-designated) Water Management Areas on Maui that could probably benefit from your work.
I have some final comments. I really appreciated this presentation and as a process person in support of community engagement, I view the tool as leveling the playing field, providing access to information for informed decision-making without paying for a consultant. The tool is helpful for various issues, including climate change, shoreline erosion, and trends in water issues. I believe that the tool will assist in making informed decisions and provide greater flexibility in incorporating changes into permit conditions. I appreciate the cultural integration and indigenous knowledge incorporated into the tool and praise its balance, credibility, and integrity. Finally, I’d like to thank the staff for their excellent work and believes that the department will use the tool frequently.
thank you Chair Chang for your comments. I like your idea about making the tool a part of the staff protocol. He suggests highlighting the relevant data sets, including agency reviews and the Ka Pa‘akai Analysis, and creating a template for staff to ensure that there is a review against those data sets for matters that come before us. I believe that this is possible and I think that creating a template will make it automatic for staff to check the relevant data sets.
I agree that the tool can be incorporated into their discussions on climate data and that I can work with staff to utilize the data in their analysis and recommendations. I suggest that building the tool into their routing and review process can make their submittals more robust. I believe that we can make the water plan a living document by utilizing the tool and incorporating it into our discussions.
thank you Commissioner Hannahs and Deputy Manuel for your input and I suggest a formalized way to pull in the HCDP or PDKE information as part of the assessment. I believe that this could be a tangible way to make it happen. Thank you Dr. Ryan Longman, how to access the HCDP or PDKE and his contact information for the general public who may be interested in following up?
could make the slides from the PowerPoint available to post on CWRM website so people can have access to it?
or links to it?
you can access the Hawaii Climate Data Portal and the Pacific Drought Knowledge Exchange by simply searching on Google. I didn’t really get into the weeds on the portal, but the Hawaii Climate Data Portal offers an interactive tool where one can make a rainfall map, and real-time data can be accessed through an API. Cyberinfrastructure can also help with accessing the data. Currently for the portfolio, one has to email me or the HCDP, but eventually, it will be a tool for everyone.
