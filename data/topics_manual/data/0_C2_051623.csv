Legislative update presented by Deputy Manuel on legislative bills, budget, and CIP
Kaleo, where are we on commissioner tenure? Any vacancies and do we need resolutions? Is somebody going off soon.
yes, Commissioner Buck’s term ends next month. Next month will be his last commission meeting. His position has been filled by Dr. Larry Miike; he will be rejoining the comission in July 2023. He has been selected by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate and will serve another four-year term.
this is Michael with comments. The Board of Water Supply really just focused on consultation or were they more deeper than that?
There were concerns raised about the bill potentially circumventing the authority of the Governor under 127a regarding the declaration of emergencies. In our testimony, we explained that our goal is not to bypass the Governor’s authority but to have the ability, similar to the Department of Health’s regulation of water quality, to address water quantity issues. Even during a declared emergency, we would work collaboratively with the Governor as a state agency and develop specific orders to address the emergency. The commission, with its expertise in water resources, would provide guidance on these orders. It’s important to note that there can be confusion between the Board of Water Supply and the commission, but we have an obligation to all water users in the state and take a comprehensive view of the situation. Concerns were also raised about the lack of criteria for issuing an emergency, but the definition in the code explicitly states that an emergency can be declared when there is insufficient quantity or quality that affects public health and safety. The decision to declare an emergency would be made by the Commission as a whole, and the process would include transparency and public input. This is how we intended to propose and draft the bill, ensuring due process and inclusivity for all stakeholders.
well done Kaleo and team. Do we have the capacity to accept philanthropy?
so, have we thought about that at all. Is there any bandwidth, to think about some of the sources we might tap to give a significant gift to take care of a precious resource.
we're open to it. I haven't been able to strategize or come up with the time really to frame; what is the ask? We definitely know the budget needs. I think the closest we've focused on is the freshwater council with Hawaii Community Foundation. And it's not necessarily us accepting the philanthropic support, but it's really to support others in the community. Whether water purveyors or private agricultural just becoming better stewards. That sometimes is even better if it's given out that way rather than it come directly to the Water Commission as a state agency. We oftentimes have more strings than anything else to accomplish that ultimate goal. Before I continue, I want to mahalo staff and our Branch Chiefs and our legislative team Michael Yoshinaga, Neal Fujii, Alexa, our legal fellow, all our branches Ryan, Katie, and Dean as well as Ayron really put in the time this session to kind of get us to where we're at. So, it takes a team to get there but Katie's been the lead now that she's been on the team to really help us look at Federal funding. We have a good chance we're going to get quite a substantial amount of federal funding from support from our entire Congressional Delegation this year. We are waiting for the final budget to kind of get through. But this will be helping us, we'll be able to leverage our de monitoring well CIP with federal funds to basically double almost triple down on our resources. And then to help support us in other water audit and well abandonment programs. So that's really where I think our core is versus philanthropic funding.
but on the philanthropic, there's a big push; migration from just funding- worthy activity to funding impact and transformation. You can't know your impact if you're not measuring. So, when we think about some of the gauging and the expense of putting in that system, maintaining it, getting the data, and analyzing it. There might be some room there so just a thought.
I will welcome your expertise in the philanthropic center on how best maybe we could approach that.
happy to chat with you and the team about it and connect with some other people who know.
The Green fee introduced by the governor is aimed at creating a vehicle for philanthropic donations. Despite having exceeded expectations in many ways, the DLNR faced capacity limitations. The legislators showed increased understanding of DLNR’s challenges and were generous in allocating funds to DLNR in the budget bill. The Water Commission has emphasized the need for better coordination between government agencies and entities. A unified statement of support for the cleanup of Red Hill and the assurance of clean, fresh water for the future was issued by the governor’s office, legislative leadership, and the City and County of Honolulu. A collective body of government representatives has been formed to hold the Navy accountable and develop strategies for addressing cleanup and future water sustainability. The Governor’s Water Council, consisting of representatives from various agencies, including the Department of Health, Department of Agriculture, and Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, is working on water-related issues statewide. The Hawai‘i Community Foundation’s Water alliance, with representation from Kaleo and myself, is involved in water-related initiatives. Monthly meetings with Ernie Lau and his team, facilitated by Kaleo and I, will focus on discussing water issues. There is a growing recognition among government stakeholders, including the legislature,governor’s office, and City and County of Honolulu, about the need for better coordination and collaboration on water management. The vulnerability and fragility of Hawai‘i’s water resources, highlighted by the Red Hill incident, necessitate collective action and a departure from isolated approaches. The Water Commission’s advocacy and the efforts of the staff have been instrumental in pushing for better control and coordination. The aim is to prevent incidents like Red Hill from occurring again and to be better prepared for natural disasters or storms that could expose vulnerabilities in the water system. Mahalo to the Water Commission and the CWRM staff for stepping up and shedding light on a lot of the issues.
as presented in the workload of some of the legislative initiatives. As you increase your staffing to comprehend all the duties that need to be accomplished. Will you continue to be O‘ahu-centric? It seems that a lot of the work is outside of that.
you're absolutely right. As a matter of just policy and leadership here at DLNR I am really trying to empower our Island staff. We are being criticized by the community for being O‘ahu-centric. I have told all our Island staff whether your land division, DOFAW, DOBAR, or DAR. I'm trying to get everybody out of silos. Whenever an issue comes up, we are triaging with all of the different divisions so that everybody is putting in their mana‘o. But at the same time trying to build capacity within our neighbor Islands as well. We learned that through covid we have to have capacity on each of these islands to support us. So, we are trying consciously to build that capacity on each of the islands so that we are supporting each other. I'm also trying to do multiple within the divisions. When an issue comes up how can we share information resources; knowledge to be much more effective?
the Aquatic biologists that we talked about; two of them will be on Maui with the workload that Ayron shared and the amount of stream work that we do have on Maui, that'll be the first CWRM shift out of Honolulu. Which I will say is a culture shock for an institution that's only been O‘ahu Central. So, I am working with staff to make sure that we have the communication in place, the support system is built. But like other divisions that do have base yards outside of O‘ahu, is to really look outward. Another thing that we're looking at is as we start to onboard or look at options maybe even for some of the planners or compliance people if we can actually recruit from the outer islands where there is a need for more jobs and provide teleworking which is now kind of an option that's evolved in post-covid as an incentive. To get and recruit really good quality staff because some people don't want to be on O‘ahu they want to stay in Kauai or Maui or a big island, we're still working through the complexities of DHRD and our HR process to make that happen but yes, I am having coming from the neighbor Island we are looking at ways to provide a diverse kind of approach to our management and regulation. So, yes.
we spend a significant amount of our time on litigation, which includes case hearings and court sessions. Our leadership team, Kaleo, Laura Ka‘akua, and I will be going out to each of the islands doing listening to sessions and really trying to engage with the community. We’re trying to be more proactive and develop that trusting relationship. I know a lot of community members don’t trust DLNR and I think the trust comes through physically being present by going into these communities and listening to what their issues are. I’m hoping that time that we spend will develop trusts and likewise, we’ll have commensurate reaction. Response with lessening the amount of time doing litigation I’m hoping we will be able to channel some of that energy into something more productive.
I'm happy to give you some free advice. I've worked with seven different DLNR chairs looked at a lot of organizations. But you have some divisions that have regional authority where their staff is at a level where they're both responsible to make decisions on the island; you have other divisions that are very Honolulu-centric, and things need to go back. So, I'm happy at any time to give you some structures of potential. And I know reorganizations are just horrible. I've been through in my share, but to really manage the island so you can break down the silos between the divisions. There are some personnel reorganizations in certain divisions that that's not how they're aligned, it's not their history, that's not how they make decisions, and I think there's some real opportunities there I'm happy to offer you some free advice on your request. Thank you.
you were speaking from your larger broader DLNR perch but from the Water Commission standpoint. Do we have any active litigation right now?
We have current contested cases that you've approved. We haven't started that process a lot of it is timing and working with AGs. The Land Board takes up a lot of the contested case capacity. We don't have much, and we've been really trying our best to walk through and walk with the community and applicant. And in the regulation and stewardship of resources so right now I think there are only two pending plus we have appeals of former contested cases.
two pending plus we have appeals of former contested cases that we are defending in the appellate courts. And there's the land division water RPS but those are not your kuleana.
just off the top of my head. The Wailuku water company, Pale‘a‘ahu waste that's in a contested case. There’s the Kawela IIFS that is pending us coming back to the commission to either Grant or deny a contested case; there's a petition for that. And then there is technically the Ota Well, that was the Kona well, contested case petition. So, there are two petitions that we have to bring back to the commission with some kind of resolution or actions or next steps but that would be the only three at this point that are pending, and then the Nā Wāi ‘Ehā appeal so that would be four judicial types of processes that we'll be engaging in.
well, it feels like the nature of the issues that we're involved with, it could be a lot more. I really want to credit the staff and Chair Chang. You mentioned that people don't trust us; people trust Ayron. I mean we hear that all the time, he’s out there in the field and so forth and we get a lot of good feedback on his work so I'm optimistic that as we have more neighbor island representation by our team, things will fall in line, and we'll avoid these contentious and expensive and delays of contested case and all this litigation and so forth.
you guys have done a lot of really good work here to sort of address a lot of those community concerns. I think having a lot of the community engagement process has also helped with respect to the Water Commission lessen those numbers.
Chair, item D’s next meeting is June 20th so it's our standard third Tuesday, but July 26th is the next one so that's the last Wednesday in July. Then August 15th we're back on schedule to Tuesday.
I did have one more on the government matters. When you mentioned Wailuku didn't the new mayor of Maui make a statement about wanting to buy them and is there any progress that we're aware of the county acquisition of the major purveyor for Nā Wai ‘Ehā.
I can provide an update on that one. We did hear from the Department of Water Supply staff that Mayor Bissen is interested and that they are going through their due diligence on that acquisition. Having heard that we already proactively reached out to the Department of Water Supply and their new leadership to kind of walk through the Nā Wai ‘Ehā decision that the commission made and that the obligations that they would have to commit to if they were to take on that kuleana in lieu of Wailuku water company and then discuss some potential future opportunities.
