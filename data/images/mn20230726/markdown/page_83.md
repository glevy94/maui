The next -- the gentleman, why don't you come on up and identify yourself, please?

**MR. GARRICK:** Hello, I'm Matt Garrick, a member of the public living in MƒÅnoa, and I really appreciate the commission for having these public meetings, for allowing public testimony, and for your -- time and consideration of this matter in looking into it.

In one part of the meeting, I -- I heard a concern whether this is relevant, and we were on the slide that was talking about the repurposing of Red Hill and whether that's relevant for this commission. And I just want to ask, don't you think that given the tanks are located in or on -- right above the aquifer, depending on who you ask, that any repurposing of these tanks would have a relevant impact on our water, potentially permanent impact on our water. So I hope you consider that.

The other thing I noticed from the presentation was that I didn't see anything about ag land, and it's been known that these PFAS allow these chemicals that are being polluted into the water can be taken into fish, can be taken into plants, move up the food chain, entering into our bodies. I was recently -- someone recently reached out to me who lives on ag land in Aiea, and they said the military came, asked to make sure that no one was drinking any of the water that's being pumped into their homes, and then left without doing.
