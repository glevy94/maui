Now. So where we're getting the tunnel and the Adit close to where the November 20 release occurred and close to the Red Hill Shaft, preparing, getting the holes that we need and the equipment that we need to do the soil vapor extraction, where this is basically we're pushing air -- we've identified locations from below the surface of the tunnel all the way to the top of the aquifer where we believe there may be fuel that's trapped within those layers to where we will be pushing in air and pulling back air, out air, sucking that air out to try to pull all of that fuel that might remain anywhere trapped within the soil. So that effort is currently in progress. We're getting the equipment ready; we're getting everything we need ready to proceed with that.

We also have to be very careful that none of the efforts that we're doing now, we're not gonna do anything that could in any way slow down or impact the defueling operations. So it is a little bit -- there are some pauses at times, and there's a lot of working with the DOH where we know a lot of people on their team that would be reviewing and are working with this, on these plans, are also the same reviewers that are working on all of the defueling. So a little bit of patience, not moving as quickly as we would like, but still an effort that we are fully pushing forward with.

Yes.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Oh, okay. A quick one.
