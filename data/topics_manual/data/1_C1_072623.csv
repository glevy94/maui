The next item on the agenda is Item C1. It is an action item, Request to Authorize the Chairperson to Enter Into a Joint Funding Agreement With USGS to Conduct a Seepage Analysis on Waikoloa Stream, Island of Hawai‘i. Ayron. 
Thank you, Chair. Ayron Strauch with the Stream Protection and Management Branch. I'm gonna briefly do a presentation on the background and reasoning why we're funding this specific stream  stream flow analysis for seepage run. I also want to add that in the title, it's (inaudible) the project is exempt from the environmental assessment requirements under HRS Chapter 343 and HAR Chapter 11-200.1.  So taking a step back, Current and Future Priority in-Stream Flow Standards. We have been working diligently in..i and West Maui throughout the last decade or so. We have in-stream flow standards in West Kauaʻi, north and south shores, and we are currently working to develop them in Southeast Kauaʻi. Last year, we established in-stream flow standards on Molokai. And in 2020 and 2021, we established in-stream flow standards in Kaukonahua, and then the Waiāhole Ditch case established them in the Waiāhole area. The Waikoloa Stream on the Big Island  can you see my cursor? Anyway, this blue segment on the Big Island is our  and Wailua on Kauaʻi are two areas of focus right now where we have developed an in-stream flow standard assessment report, which is the compilation of best-available information, and we are working with the water users and the community to develop an in-stream flow standard or an interim in-stream flow standard that protects public trust uses. Here is the draft in-stream flow standard assessment report that we published online in June, and we have sent out notices via email to stakeholders throughout the Waikoloa and Hawaiʻi Island region. We have a landing page for the in-stream flow standard report online. The report utilizes a seepage run conducted by the US Geological Survey in 2021 which measured seepage gains and losses through the main stem of Waikoloa Stream from its headwaters down to the mouth, and so the headwaters is this stream branch  sorry, you can't see my pointer.
Are you full screen, by the way, or is that   
I am. Yeah, it should be full   
It's (inaudible).  
Try that. Hold on.  
There's the pointer.  
We'll just do this (inaudible). So we'll share screen (inaudible), and you can share, and you can access it.  
Make it bigger.  
So it's a little bigger.  
There we go.  
And then you can actually see your pointer now.  
Oh, okay. So the Waikoloa Stream headwaters start in the Kohala protected  watershed protected area managed by DOFA and then flows down through Waimea Town all the way up through  and the lower reach is actually referred to as Waiʻulaʻula, and the stream is gaining flow up the mauka areas and it gains flows in this region of Waikoloa  or Waimea Town, but it's losing principally between the  the stream diversion that feeds the county water supply and where it  the geology transitions.   So, how do I  okay, there we go Okay. So here's the underlying geology. Again, These green dots are the measurement sites. The orange line is the stream where it's losing, and then the transition from the Hawi volcanics to the Hualālai volcanics  or Hamakua volcanics, sorry  is where it moves from losing to gaining, so it actually gains stream flow in this region. And this unique geology  we'd like to confirm that this stream flow is losing and the rate of loss, and then it's gaining at the rate of gain because it has implications for meeting the public trust needs of this stream Particularly, this region just below Lālāmilo Homesteads, this agricultural area has a historic ʻauwai system, multiple historic ʻauwai systems, and we have an informal complaint at this stage that there is insufficient water to meet the traditional practices of the agriculture in the area. This stream also runs through a number of parks and provides aesthetic and recreational value This stream was also identified in the USGS Water Resource Management Monitoring Needs Assessment published in 2020. Particularly, this seepage run right here, this blue line that's highlighted by USGS as a point that needs to be monitored, as understanding surface water-groundwater interactions in this region has implications for groundwater recharge as well Runs funded by the water commission, in the 2018 funding for the low-flow statewide low-flow project, a number of West Maui stream seepage runs were funded. In 2020, the commission approved funding for a number of West Lahaina side of West Maui seepage runs. And here on, in 2023, we're funding the Waikoloa Stream seepage run. Because we are physically constrained, we cannot just fund all stream flow or all streams identified as priority streams for seepage runs, but where the data are needed to make management decisions, we are going stream by stream, essentially So that's all I have for a presentation. The request (inaudible) the staff recommendations which are to authorize the chairperson to enter into a joint funding agreement between the Commission on Water Resource Management and the US Geological Survey to collect and (inaudible) to conduct seepage analysis (inaudible) measurements for one high-priority stream for a period of one year until June 30th, 2024. A joint funding agreement in the amount of $21,300 would be shared by the commission for $11,300 and the US Geological Survey for $10,000 Authorize the chairperson to make such further amendments or modifications to the contract agreement consistent with the terms set forth above as may be necessary to accomplish the goals described here, provided that any Amendment or modification does not require additional commission funding. Request that Hawai‘i Department of Water Supply comply with any stream diversion operational needs USGS deems necessary to conduct a successful seepage run. Declare that the project is exempt from EA requirements under HRS Chapter 343 and HAR Chapter 11-200.1. Are there any questions?
Not a question, but it's fascinating, East Maui when you talked about the different characteristics of the geology. So between Hamakua and Hawi, what are the different characteristics?
So there are perched water bodies. The Hawi volcanics tend to be thin and perched, providing some level of perched water bodies which contributes to lots of spring flow. The Y  that particular area of the stream in the Hawi volcanics is losing  is not yet determined.
That's what 
But one of the reasons why we're doing the seepage run, again, most of these volcanics are tend to be pretty porous, so  but that  there is a high elevation region where the Kohala volcanic, you know, chill building phase and the Mauna Kea chill building phase overlapped, so there's somewhat unique geology, especially in that Waimea Town region, that has higher elevationgroundwater. And that's known, there are a number of DWS wells that take advantage of that high-elevation groundwater for drinking water supply. But it also clearly contributes to sustaining stream flow. So it's just really a unique location, and there have been the biota data that are available demonstrates the stream supports native amphibious species, we know it supports a lot of recreational values, and this region has heavily concentrated in archaeological sites that relate to agriculture, both cooler dryland agriculture and wetland agriculture. C
How much is being diverted, and what percent is that of the base flow? 
Great question. So the capacity of the diversion off the top of my head is somewhere, I think, 2.5 mgd, between 2 and 3 mgd, and that is a hundred percent of base flow. 
And so, historically, it went all the way down to the ocean? 
Yes. 
How far down are those people that  with the agriculture lots? 
They're just below Waimea Town, not far. I mean, it's pretty high up. 
Okay. 
Maybe just one thing to add, this would be one of the only fresh streams that we potentially restore mauka to makai from Upolu to Puna, basically. It would be the only perennial stream that this commission could balance on an in-stream full-stream restoration  or at least base flow restoration that supports that type of ecological support. 
And Waimea Town has no other source currently? 
No. 
They  they have two high-elevation groundwater wells that could meet most of their needs. It's just  
Cost. 
cost, basically. It's way cheaper to utilize surface water. 
Ayron, this is Dawn. I just have two questions. One, your  your Recommendation No. 3 regarding Department of Water Supply, so what kind of requirements do you have of them? 
We just want them to  we want them to be cooperative with USGS. There isn't a specific requirement necessarily. 
Okay. 
Other than maybe don't adjust things during the day while they're trying to take the flow measurements, they just  we just need them to be cooperative. 
And you're gonna coordinate with them? I mean, this is not an unusual request?   
Correct.   
Okay. And the other second question I had is who are the users of this  of this stream?   
In terms of domestic water supply    
Yeah, that's    
via the county or the    
Okay.   
Is that    
I mean, if there's diversions, who's  who are the major diverters?   
The two primary divergences that are on the books are Parker Ranch; they have a two-inch pipeline that takes an unknown amount of water because they did not  they have not metered their  their system. But we have been engaging with them, and they are  they have ordered the meters, and they are working on installing them as we speak. And the County Department of Water Supply  back in the '40s, Marine Dam was built to supply the Army's drinking water needs for  during or post World War II training in the region, and that then was  is now utilized by the county for drinking.hat and a diversion on Kohakohau Stream which all contribute to the reservoir system above Waimea Town.
Okay, very good. Any other questions?(No response.)
Do I have a motion?
So moved.
Is there a second?
Second.
All right. The motion has been moved and seconded to approve the chairperson entering into a joint funding agreement as well as the EA exemption. All in favor; please say aye.
Maybe, Chair  Chair, before the vote, just to note for the record that there's nobody present in the room or online for testimony, just for the record.
You're very  usually, Collin is the one who reminds me about that.
He is reminding us in the corner.
Okay.
But to verbalize it.
He's always so good about  I always forget that. So, yes, let me just ask, is there anyone in the room or on Zoom that would like to testify on this matter?(No response.)
Okay. Hearing none, a motion has been made and seconded. All in favor; please say aye.  *(Response.)*  
And Mr. Katayama, are you on the  are you  are you with us?   
Commissioner Katayama is not here. He had to leave for the afternoon. So we have quorum.  
Okay, we have quorum. Okay. So there has been a unanimous vote of the five members present. Mr. Katayama did not return after lunch.  
MOTION  (HO/MIKE) To approve C1 with EA exemption.   
UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED  HANNAHS/ KAGAWA-VIVIANI/ HO/MIKE/CHANG  
Okay, thank you.
