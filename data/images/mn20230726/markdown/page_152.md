mean, DLNR, we are struggling with water management -- watershed management plans. How -- our struggle is how do we charge the users an equitable amount for their impacts to our watersheds? 

And I guess I just -- I'm frustrated because I don't see a like -- a like kind of appreciation when, you know, here in -- I don't -- I guess I just don't see that there is a -- a measurable response to those who are using the most. But yet I've got all of these nonprofit groups running out there trying to get money to do these wonderful projects, and I don't see government trying to, you know, tell -- I think, you know, it's like Neil says, maybe Kamehameha Schools has to rethink that, or maybe the swimming pools. 

But I don't know, Barry and Abbey, is there -- I mean, what -- what kind of efforts is BWS -- you know, do we just ask nicely or do -- or do we just turn off the stick? I mean, like I said, I'm tired; this has been kind of a long morning, but I -- yet, I'm struggling at DLNR because we have the same issues, and I'm trying to tell these large landowners, you've gotta pay -- you have to pay for watershed management on East Maui. 

MR. USAGAWA: Right.

CHAIR CHANG: How do -- how is this -- how is this equitable here?

MR. USAGAWA: Good question. You know, two things.
