Minutes  

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** That satisfies the immediate issue before us, but the larger issue is that’s a lot of uses for a small amount of water. Where will the Commission be going with that, balancing there?  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** That's why we're focusing our efforts on Honokōwai first, especially since it's all ground water. We don't really have the complexities of dealing with the ground and surface water interactions and then once we get there, then we'll move back up north towards Honokōhau, Honolua, and then start making our way south. After Honokōwai, we will start getting to the complexities of ground and surface water. There's the major diversion from Honokōhau is there which feeds municipal uses for both private and public developments.  

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Any progress on the county side with the treatment of the wastewater?  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** I'm not sure where we last left it, but I think they are more serious about it, but nothing that we've been apprised to.  

**CHAIR CHANG:** They’ve got other things on their plate. How does our Maui temp housing, the water that's being used for Maui temp housing fold into…because we've been saying if it's an existing use, we've been permitting it. If it's a new use, you've got to wait for our water management process.  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** Correct, as of now close to all of the developments are being fed by the County. Those that may be fed by private are currently on hold and so until we get more information, we are moving forward with that. The only one is a small project which Hawai‘i Water Service, I think it's only 50 homes on the golf course where they're building the temp housing for the workers. That's the only thing we need to assess.  

**CHAIR CHANG:** I think Commissioner Miike’s concern about, we're going to have a lot more challenges in this designation. We're just not going to have enough and I'm really worried about where we're going to…You’ve got so many different moving parts with the EP, the Maui temp housing, and the restoration of Lahaina.  

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** When is your vacation planned? Pardon me, that was really unfair. You're doing great, you really are.  

**DEPUTY UYENO:** To Alexa's credit, when the whole admin bill thing came up, she was looking at the State Water Code review and I think was that the ’86? Back then they did recognize that the water shortage issues in West Maui and so back then they were already contemplating designation and we're in this situation now.  

**CHAIR CHANG:** That doesn't make me feel any better.
