Increases looked. The bigger the dot, the bigger the increase. These increases are based on the permitted rates at the water commission, and in most cases, the permitted rates are actually higher than the actual groundwater withdrawal rates.

And here's a map showing the water level changes caused by that scenario, and we can see that the big impact was in the Schofield Aquifer. You can see that's because there's a bunch of increases here. Oops. But there are also changes along the central corridor where the groundwater levels were increased. There's some increases in the dike-impounded groundwater areas. These are high-intensity; you can see the color here is kind of dark, so that indicates a high-intensity water level change, but it's not widespread.

This is a map of the change in the saltwater-freshwater boundary, and you can see that, again, the big change is in the freshwater lens areas both in the south and in the north.

This is a map of the change in streamflow, and the biggest change that's apparent here is at the springs by the cap rock, so the Pearl Harbor Springs and North Shore too. You don't see so much in the dike-impounded groundwater area, but that's probably because the model did not change the withdrawal in the tunnels, and much of the water that's...
