-- and the branch lead, Dean, maybe comment on that to really assess aquifer health as a -- in a more holistic manner.

DEPUTY MANUEL: I'll -- I'll jump in real quick, and then if Ayron comes back, he can jump in. So I think you hit it on the head. Our groundwater guys are good at what they do, right, evaluating water levels, chlorides, the -- the profile, right, of our aquifer, and oftentimes the changes in -- in groundwater take years, if not decades to see, right, over time. So it's kind of just monitoring that. It's not a -- you know, a rain event that all of a sudden our aquifer increases exponentially. But with that said, we do know there's interaction, and there's additional data sets and data gaps that we potentially need to fill. Kind of we're -- you know (inaudible) of what Chair Chang had mentioned, we -- the more data we have, the better and more informed decisions we can make holistically as it relates to aquifer health. So there -- there are studies here. These are some gaining streams, so there is a groundwater-surface water connection per my initial conversations with Dr. Strauch. And if that's him, he can also add in.

(Laughter.)

DEPUTY MANUEL: Perfect timing. But there are spring sources, as we're aware of, along the coast which also indicate kind of this interaction or something -- geology, right, creating that space for ground and surface water.
