Minutes

transparent what this delegation involves. I think it's just more for like public understanding and I know you have a lot on your time, but I think it would sort of front end some of the concerns and questions, as well.

**RYAN IMATA:** We can do that, yeah we can do that.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** It would certainly help my brain, so thanks.

**CHAIR CHANG:** I would just say for the record, in December when Hāpuna came out, I would tell you I was very concerned about everything being delegated. It wasn't delegated to the Chair, it was delegated to the First Deputy. When I came on board and then hearing the concerns by Jonathan Scheuer, Kapua Sproat, and it was more process than it was substance. For me I distinguish two things - procedurally it is wanting to have transparency, wanting to make sure that our process is fair and objective. Since December to now, we've taken away the delegation to the Chair and we've given it back to the Board. I think Ryan has had comments, he's consulted apparently with like the water departments, not fully with DHHL, but you did have a conversation with Jonathan that there seems to be good recommendations that have come forward. I mean for some of the substantive issues are being addressed in the Ka Pa‘akai guidelines because there may be a difference of opinion with some of us on the Commission. I do believe that there is a requirement for Ka Pa‘akai Analysis in everything we do. The scope of that analysis to me is determined based upon the action that's being proposed. There may be a big difference between an individual domestic well, less than 27 versus a water bottling use. I do think Ka Pa‘akai, the issues may be different, like the 343. To a certain extent I sort of saw this as an SMA minor-major. SMA minor- there is delegation to the planning director, but it fits certain categories. I think that's what this was an attempt to do - as saying we're going to follow the Ka Pa‘akai guidelines, if it follows the pump installation standards that can be delegated, I think, if the two different criteria that you put under here. I also like the one that Aurora brought up that there should be another section that says, “it shall not supersede any Commission actions including for example the Keauhou designation, eight conditions that were put on there that should apply. In any case where the Board has taken action, that this delegation should not supersede that, that those other conditions should be included or brought back to the Board. I also like the comment by Andrew Choy about additional forms of notice. I think even publishing an OEQC [former Office of Environmental Quality Control] bulletin, that's probably much more widely read than perhaps our own website. I’d also like us to consider, Andrew made a recommendation to amend two and adding F - pumps and aquifers where DHHL has a reservation. That seemed to be reasonable. In my mind, procedurally we've begun to address that. My concern was transparency, due process, if we're addressing notice. Substantively, it looks like the staff has come down with some criteria, whether that's rulemaking, that's another question. Obviously we're not going to be here to answer that, so Commissioner, your thoughts.
