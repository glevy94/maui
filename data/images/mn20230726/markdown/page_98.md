**DR. IZUKA:** Great. That's progress, okay.

**COMMISSIONERS:** There we go. Yeah.

**DR. IZUKA:** Okay, here we go. Okay. Let me hide this guy.

Okay. Well, thank you, Neil, and thank you for inviting me to speak about this study that we've been doing. So I'm gonna talk today about Hawai‘i Volcanic Aquifer Study and give you some highlights of the results. This was a study—one of the studies that the USGS was doing across the nation of the groundwater availability of the principal aquifers in the United States. The final report, the third and final report of this study, was recently published, I think maybe about three or four months ago, and I—most of what I'm gonna talk about comes from this final report, but there are two other reports.

The first report is a summary of the hydrogeology of Hawai‘i, and it includes updates all the way up to when it was published was kind of like the mid-2010s or so. It also includes updates on groundwater recharge for Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, and Maui.

The second report—let's see. Let me get my pointer out here. Oops. The second report, that one goes down into the weeds about groundwater modeling. So for those who are interested in that, you can look at that, you know, if you're into mod flow and all of the details that go into that.
