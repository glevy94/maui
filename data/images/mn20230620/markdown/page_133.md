Joanna, do you want to --

**COMMISSIONER SETO:** Just a short one.  
Thank you for all the hard work that you've put in on the commission, eight years and plus. We appreciate everything that you've done for the water and the big picture of water, not just one focus of quantity. So, yes, there is the overlap between quantity and quality, and we do need to work together. So thank you for also being on the PIG -- sorry, the permitted interaction group -- and providing the input that we needed for the Red Hill situation.

**COMMISSIONER BUCK:** And thank you for what you do. You've been in the spotlight the last couple of years. I know it hasn't been easy.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Wayne, did you want to say anything to Mike?

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I think one of the signature characteristics of an effective organization is the composition of its members in that each member provides a very distinct and unique skill set and a point of view. As you look at the composition of our members today, I think we have that, Mike, and your perspective has filled a very important segment of how we approach issues and how we resolve that. So, you know, again, thank you, Mike. And unfortunately, our first interaction was I replaced you on your seat, so I apologize for that.
