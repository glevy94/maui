Mr. Dean Uyeno, SPAM Program Manager, CWRM
Dean Uyeno with the Commission Stream Protection and Management Branch here to present on submittal item C-2. Approval of stream channel alteration permit application scat 5955.3 by the state of Hawaii Department of Transportation. The project is proposing to widen the Kalihi stream bridge on the ocean side of the H1 Highway and affect approximately 14 linear feet of the East and West Bank wall to accommodate the extended bridge abutments and foundations. The details are in the submittal and just want to note that we did not receive a comment letter from the State Historic Preservation division. We did however receive comments from the division of aquatic resources and the division of forestry and wildlife and so their comments are reflected in the recommendation. If I may, I would jump straight to the recommendation, but the commission approved stream channel alteration permit SCAP 5955.3 application subject to the standard conditions in exhibit four and the special conditions outlined below. a) approval is subject to SHPD concurrence to SHPD requires conditions authorities shall be delegated to the Deputy director to attach those as a condition of the stream channel alteration permit in confirmation with conformance with the Hawaii division of aquatic resources recommendations. The permittee shall ensure stream flow connectivity around the project site at all times with no more than 50 percent of the stream channel being diverted around the project area to enable ‘o‘opu and opae passage incorporated by reference to exhibit two. The applicant shall contact the division of aquatic resources should unforeseen events pose a potential threat to the aquatic environment in conformance with the Hawai‘i division portion of wildlife recommendations. The permittee shall seek to minimize impacts in a species, utilizes native plant species for landscaping and prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species and the letter from the division of forestry and Wildlife is attached to exhibit three. Other than that staff stands on its submittal and I'm available if you have any questions?
good afternoon, Commissioners. I'm Miya Akiba with Jacobs Engineering. I'm an environmental planner and I prepared this permanent application. I don't really have anything to add unless there's any questions? And I am in agreement with the conditions of the permit.
I just have a quick comment that it's kind of nice to know that there is ‘o‘opu‘akupa, you know other native aquatic animals that can handle Kalihi stream.
