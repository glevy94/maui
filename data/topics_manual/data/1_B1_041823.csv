Approval of Stream Diversion Works Permit Application (SDWP.5951.6) and Special
Conditions to East Maui Irrigation, Company, LLC, for Abandonment of Stream Diversion Works No. 184.6, Allowing Applicant to Breach and Remove the Kapala‘alaea Map Key: (2) 2-8-007:001.
Deputy Kaleo Manuel, CWRM Branch
Deputy Manuel read the summary of request as submitted and stated that staff stands on its submittal. Deputy Manuel then read the staff’s recommendations.
Kaleo, seems like the theme for this meeting. Obviously, our East Maui decision was abandoning a lot of unnecessary diversions, yet we talked about the potential for storage of reservoirs. So, did any analysis go into it? Is this a potential reservoir or dam that could offer opportunities to store excess water? And if not, as you know there is a Senate Bill 1066 that the commission might be setting up a priority list of capital Improvement projects that could include restoration of the dams and reservoirs. So, the question is, was any analysis done on this reservoir? I know you read the news today and the land board is looking at a decision on Kalihiwai on Kaua‘i. It's just important that we kind of go through that thought process before we close down these reservoirs. Is this an important reservoir, whose partner? What would it take to restore it? Does it offer us opportunity? so that’s much of a comment. But I'm just curious about this one. Was any analysis done in that regard?
Mahalo Commissioner Buck. I will start the response and then we do have the applicants here and they may be able to address directly more of your comment about analysis of use etc., So, specifically to the Water Commission, that level of analysis of use of reservoirs for storage etc. in this context isn't something that we've looked at. Right now, this is just a stream diversion works permit as it relates to dam safety. Dam safety is working with the applicant to review it. I don't know as a state as a whole who is ultimately responsible for driving this analysis. Is it department of AG? Is it State Engineering? In DLNR, right now the Water Commission isn’t doing that level analysis. Something that we could look at and into but that's not currently what we're looking at. Right now, it’s purely from the regulatory perspective that we're looking at it. It could become more of a component, for example, of the State Water Projects Plan. And just to note, this is a private dam. Right now, private property so to an extent the state works with private parties to help support them and analyze that. But we've never really done that analysis on non-governmental plans to look at this approach comprehensively.
Aloha Chairperson Chang and fellow Commissioners and Deputy Manuel. Mahalo for having us. In early 2000, we did an internal analysis of this dam. Not just historical, but in a time that I've worked here in my 25 years. We're looking at the amount of time that reservoir actually held water. When we were in sugar, we've been farming all these years and at that time even on a conservative basis we were looking at like 20 percent of the time. Now with climate change, as we had that excellent presentation done earlier, you know climate change is a whole other different animal. The changes in the atmosphere and in the area. I've seen over my 25-year career, we will be taking even less amounts of water in the reservoir and speaking briefly with dam safety over the years. I've been working with them closely for many years and you know we've been talking about this remediation of this magnitude would be anywhere from possibly from 12 to 15 million dollars and for something like that to hold water 15 percent of the year. Water is important but for 15 percent of the year that's just a tough pill to swallow for anyone. Is it an important reservoir? It is, but we've been able to function without it since 2007. We haven't operated it since 2007 and then you add the IIFS that's coming in. That's just even less water that's available for the reservoir so, we just felt that this was the time, plus there are safety hazards in there that could potentially get worse so we felt like this was the time to address this and so we came up with our own internal analysis. Commissioner Buck: Mark, I appreciate that. I think we totally understand that a lot of the private dams and reservoirs are a liability right now from private landowners. I think we are pushing the legislature to understand that, and it has to be a modicum of public funding in partnership with private landowners, to at least preserve the important reservoirs that offer a whole multitude of benefits. So, I hope in your analysis, and I totally appreciate it from your perspective, that you keep that in mind, and you can share with us some of the factors. What would it take on the public side to help you preserve this might not be the reservoir that we're talking about, but I think in the future there will be public funds available to try to partner with private landowners to be able to restore and bring these reservoirs and dams back up to a level because if they don't produce a lot of public benefits, in addition to potential water storage during dry times and to capture episodic rain event. So, I just appreciate, because I know you do have a lot of dams and reservoirs in your portfolio, that if you can provide us that kind of context that will help, at least the public policy makers to identify the public benefits involved and the types of contributions from the public side that would work in partnership with you to keep some of these dams’ reservoirs in place. Thank you.
thank you for your comment’s, Commissioner Buck. We've taken all of that into consideration and we are working on remediation projects for other dams and reservoirs that we feel would be more strategic and more beneficial, not just for the farm because these are all just farm reservoirs, they don't supply anything to the public. But we're talking about making improvements to other dams and reservoirs that are going to be more strategically important for us. 
well, I would check out Senate Bill 1066. And it does ask the Commission for next year to come up with a priority list of capital improvement projects that include both public and private contributions. So hopefully we can use your data to come up and help move up some of the list of these priority reservoirs. Thank you.
thank you, Deputy Manuel for presenting that. I guess I’m mostly responding to some written testimony received and will probably hear about it later, not about the agricultural use for climate change but the other end of it. I first read stream diversion and then I read dam. Those sort of confer different levels of hazard and risk to downstream communities. I wanted to better understand what the status of the engineering review is, and any potential dialogue was SPHD since the submittal was posted. Archaeological features might not be on site, but they might be affected by changes in the flow regimes especially during high rainfall events.
I’ll start and see if we can address some of these questions. Again, so related to what's before you are what we have authority over. The stream diversion, in this case in the stream, the dam itself is what is diverting water. That’s just a design and how it was developed. So, one of the permits that we require stream diversion works abandonment. If you're going to formally abandon a diversion in this case, because it's also a dam, they have to comply with safety standards and their application and review process. So, what we're trying to do is make sure that on our books the diversion is taken off. It's no longer a diversion, something that's allowing the applicant to divert water. But on the dam safety side how that's designed, how it manages the water flooding etc. that application is still in process based on what we understand. There's still going to be a process that DLNR and dam safety is going to look at in terms of managing potential downstream impacts. We also submitted this to SHPD but haven't received a response yet. If SHPD does come back to the commission with recommended preservation or archaeological inventory, then we would add that as conditions to this permit. And if the applicant is not happy with that then we come back to the Commission basically and say here's the situation this is what SHPD’s recommending we're saying to add it as a condition. But the applicant may have concerns or not want to address that. Those are things that we can address as part of this process. Right now, we're taking our piece of the pie in this larger decommissioning effort to make sure we're meeting our compliance requirements. So that’s my simple response to where we're at.
so, does engineering division have regulatory oversight?
they have regulatory oversight over the dam and how it's designed for decommissioning. They issue permits and manage it and fine and have regulatory oversight. The Board of Land and Natural Resources manages that process.
So, they have a separate approval if they agree that removing the dam itself, not just permitting the dam but removal meets their requirements. I'm just worried that if we approve something then we take on the liability in case it becomes a hazard. So, we're seeing these as parenthesis.
that’s the way I understand it. I apologize that dam safety is not here or engineering is not here and maybe I can ask Ryan to run down the hallway and see if we can get somebody from engineering to jump on. That would be great. They reviewed the application, and their comments were, we are working with the applicant on their dam removal application and will be coordinating that. And so again the applicant is here and is going through all of the regulatory requirements in order to be compliant with the work that they're proposing. I don't know if Mark has any additional information to share based on their conversation with dam safety. But, from our perspective, we're coordinating on the Water Commission side and dam safety will be reviewing it on the Land Board side which is purely within their authority and regulatory review.
we've been working with dam safety for quite a while on the removal of this and meeting all of their requirements and their criteria. Design criteria, restoration criteria, all of that. As Kaleo mentioned, we are in SHPD review. They are reviewing this currently and I know that Pilale bay, a lot of the archaeological sites there are awesome. And they've definitely been inventoried. I’m sure that SHPD would have something to add about that.
Aurora, do you have anything else you want to add to that? Can I just tag on following up with that comment Mark. Under the engineering and the abandonment on the dam safety side. What is going to be physically done? I’m thinking of environmental impacts. Because the Water Commission is saying there is no EA trigger but I’m wondering, is there a trigger at the dam safety site?
dam safety gives us the requirements to complete removal of the embankment, and they do flow dynamic studies to decide the width of the breach in the actual removal so we have to take out the entire embankment that has to be removed off-site and then all of the sedimentation has to be protected and the stream bed has to be protected with thousands of yards of rip rap just large boulders and rocks that are placed along the bottom to keep the sediment from flowing out. There's embankment restoration on either side of the stream banks that has to take place so that we minimize any downstream impacts along the way. It's a whole transformation of as best as possible restoring everything to what it was prior to this dam being built in 1885. That’s the goal of dam safety and the restoration of ecology, and the rest of the entire waterway being restored to pre- contact or pre-erection of the dam itself.
do you know whether they're going to require an environmental assessment to be completed?
I don't know. I don't believe so. I'm not sure we went through this before with them Kaupakalua dam and that wasn't required for that. But again, we were given a list of the requirements, and I didn't see that on the requirements. That may be a question for dam safety.
we'll check with them prior to coming to the board because I'm just thinking that's a lot of restoration of the embankment. You are moving a lot of potential dirt, soil and putting rocks there might be some impact so. That might be a more relevant question to the engineering department than to CWRM because before us, is only the abandonment of the stream diversion.
So, in this case there’s overlap where the thing that is diverting water is the dam. It functions as that and most diversions do too, but sometimes we just have a pipe or a pump that’s located in the stream. In this case what we are primarily doing, and this is ultimately tied to follow- ups of abandonment of diversions following irrigation throughout the decision in order, is working with East Maui to get through this to take the kuleana off. Knowing that once this is done, we don't have to regulate them as a diverter, and they are no longer required to report to us and meet all those compliance requirements, kind of cleans up the books. But this is part of that formal process.
I appreciate that clarification. And I appreciate the good work that you guys are doing Mark. I guess sometimes when there's overlapping jurisdiction you don't want something to fall through the cracks right. Okay.
is Dr. Ayron Strauch or if someone from stream protection and management division is present. She is concerned about the downstream implications of removing a reservoir in the context of climate change. She believes that the engineering division may have more information on how these changes will flow. She also expresses worry that restoring the area to pre- dam period may not be feasible due to changes in the stream dynamics caused by climate change. She asks for clarification on the stream dynamics and their implications.
the dam in question is an in-stream dam that captures high flow events in the stream. The frequency of these events is changing due to climate change. Peak flow estimates are based on a long-term record and not projected future events. The peak flow for a two-year flood event is roughly 300 million gallons per day, while the dam’s capacity is only 100 million gallons. Currently, the peak flow would overtop the existing structure every other year. Removing the dam would not affect the regularity with which high flow events pass through.
so that's the periodicity. You don't have this 100-million-gallon buffer, so you actually are going to increase, maybe the frequency of like if you're downstream, you're going to increase the frequency at which we see these bumps and I guess I just want a better understanding.
there are still upstream diversions in the watershed that capture lower flow events. However, even with the dam in place, the two-year storm event was still overtopping the existing infrastructure, meaning that removing the dam would not significantly impact the frequency of high flow events downstream, but may have a small impact on their magnitude.
okay that was my question. I'll pass it to Wayne. I'm processing.
looking at the requirements of other diverters. How does it affect them during the low flow? Because now you have no release even if you had 100-million-gallon storage that somehow was controlled, you have no control now so, how does that impact those diversions and those users?
what I understand about the watershed is that the diversions downstream are owned or operated by East Maui Irrigation. How they manage their system, whether they release water from the reservoir or not, would only be impacting themselves. Is that what you're asking? What is the implication for downstream users? I don’t see it being consequential.
so, during peak flows. The attenuation of the flows, how does it affect downstream users or facilities at the stream mouth for example?
downstream landowners are primarily EMI themselves. The larger flood events: the one in 10-year flood that is now occurring more regularly, as you might be expecting with climate change. It was 1300 CFS so approximately 900 million gallons per day. That dam is going to have no impact on that flow event, and we don't predict that the removal of the dam is going to substantially affect the magnitude or the frequency of the high flow major flooding events.
EMI manages low flow events so that's not an issue. The engineering division is going to go through all this analysis as well.
Of course, the engineering division is going to go through all this analysis.
okay, good. Thank you.
thank you very much. This dam presumably was built for a good reason because it was necessary either to slow down large rainfall events and flooding. But secondly, I would think it was built as a storage device for irrigation of farmland. Whether it's HC&S or other users somebody spent a fair amount of money to build it in the first place. Is that need prospectively non- existent today? In other words, is there no reason for that additional storage? Is it something that is really unnecessary prospectively for the future as a storage device?
we took all that into account. This was back in the early 2000s when we did our own internal review and that was with sugarcane and the projection came and Mahi pono took over. Now we're looking at storage which the plan is to use half of the water that we used back when we were in sugar. And that's currently what we're doing. Because that reservoir doesn't hold 100 million gallons. My records indicate 52 million gallons and that was prior. I have only been here over 25 years and we haven’t dredged it or tried to remove anything so that has settled in. So, there's probably even less storage in it now. It’s expensive to rebuild. They're also very expensive to bring into compliance, maintain and operate. Then you carry the liability that goes along with that. Now we're talking about climate change where water is even less. So is it worth expanding that amount of money to preserve something that's even less and it just becomes more and more difficult to manage, it's a question of economics as far as maintaining or bringing the dam into compliance. Remediating all the things that we need to remediate. It just ended up being that unfortunately it's not going to be as beneficial to us as we would have liked it.
hypothetical question, if there were a government agency responsible for managing distribution of water resources would it make any sense to have a governmental agency take over the responsibility of this dam and to manage it for the community interest in the long run? One of the things that's poignant in my memory was the sort of devolution disrepair of the West Maui ditch. That was largely made unfeasible in terms of operation by virtue of the decommissioning of reservoirs along the way.
I cannot speak about the history of the West Maui system. The current location of Kapala‘alaea dam where it is located and the ditch that it does supply, that water is only farm water. It doesn't service the community in any other way, but just brings water across to irrigate crops. I think that has the smallest watershed of all of them.
thank you for answering those difficult questions and sharing your wisdom in that respect. EMI’s position with respect to the decommissioning on that and there are good reasons for it from your perspective.
Chairperson of the Sierra Club Maui Group. The streams affected by the dam are not part of the East Maui decision and are not regulated by IIFS. The land where the dam is located is no longer owned by EMI but by Kamehameha schools for conservation and restoration. She raises concerns about the impact of high storm events on traditional Hawaiian practices and infrastructure. She suggests involving the ‘Aha Moku Council and conducting an inventory of the area around the dam.
Consultant for East Maui Irrigation. He clarified that an environmental assessment is not required for the project since Nationwide permits number 3 and 13 will be applicable. An endangered species Section 7 consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service is required and has been completed. They are waiting for Nationwide permits from the Corps of Engineers for Section 404 and section 401 blanket coverage from the Department of Health.
She is the ‘Aha Moku representative for Hamakualoa and has some concerns about the proposed project. She was not able to listen to everything, but also did not find any communication in her emails about the project. She has reservations about the way the project is being approached and wants to learn more about the history and intent behind the dam or diversion that was put in place in 1885. She believes there needs to be more consideration given to the cultural significance of the area and wants to reach out to kuleanas in the area to gather more information. She is also concerned about the lack of response from Departments that were contacted about the project and asks for more time before making a decision.
regarding local consultation with ‘Aha Moku Council as well as immediate residence. Is it possible to add them as a layer in concurrence to SHPD recommendation since its subject to?
based on the conversation and having to wait for SHPD and because this is also tied to a jurisdiction of DLNR, I'm comfortable in terms of timeline differing a month or two to do specific outreach. The recommendations: - Kamehameha schools, if they are a downstream landowner, if they have any comments on the application. - Department of Transportation based on Sierra club's comments about whether the drainage in the road is sufficient to handle additional flows. I’m comfortable with taking a quick pause but would like to check in with Mark if there are any critical timeframes.
I want to address the Department of Trans in terms of consultation. We ran the required design flows that they asked us to run through that watershed and they responded that it was okay to move ahead. The culvert that we do have in place on the highway is sufficient to take the design plot that they gave us. As far as delaying, we are sitting on SHPD, and it can be a lengthy review as they turn over all stones, but it's good because they do you know they do turn over all the stones.
I want to address a kind of procedural issue. In my view from the Commission standpoint, we have the Constitutional obligation Article 12 Section 7. Based on the information that's presented to us, I do not believe that that is kuleana of our staff. In my mind that is the kuleana of the applicant to provide sufficient information to make that analysis. I am proposing that Mahi Pono, the applicant, talk stories with Joyclynn to address some of her concerns as part of your application to us.
ultimately if our goal is to decommission this dam and it's going to affect downstream, something that Joyclynn feels strongly about, then yes of course.
Mahalo. I really appreciate that. The burden is on the applicant and then the commission applies the information provided. If we don't have enough information, then we shouldn't take action. Makes sense commissioners?
That sounds like a deferral. The other option that I thought is to say we approve it if you get the concurrence of SHPD and if you want to add ‘Aha Moku we could condition it. That way we don't need to see it or touch it again if the concurrence is there.
I don't want to delegate Ka Pa‘akai to SHPD. My preference would be, that Mark, you tell us when you're ready to come back. This reservoir has been abandoned for quite some time. It will give you guys time to talk story. That is more appropriate that we have the landowner talking story with these families who have a connection. I don't think we should be accepting that responsibility on behalf of the applicant.
I think that's really important to have that dialogue. But then in the future there might be settings where an applicant has a vested interest in maybe taking a selection of that information. There might be certain powered dynamics and local dynamics where I think the commission staff, I want to look to the commission staff to say, is this a good Ka Pa‘akai analysis? Is it complete? Are we doing more than just citing an oral history but speaking to the living practicing practitioners here today. I don't want to supersede the staff's role in this because they have so much experience with multiple applications, but I agree with you like we don't want to prevent direct communication.
I appreciate that. In my mind from a legal standpoint staff can do the assessment based upon the information provided. So, if there is not enough information, they should let us know that or we can make that assessment or like these public meetings I really appreciated Jocelynn’s comments. A public platform provides the opportunity for the community to tell us you don’t have enough information and then we can make the assessment to defer. I don't have a problem legally saying I cannot fulfill my constitutional obligation therefore I'm going to have to deny the application. I hope we don't have to do that, but again I don't want to place that burden on our staff. Because then that shifts in my mind, a legal burden from the applicant to CWRM staff to do.
I have no problem with the deferral especially since we're dealing with an applicant who's really trying to do the right thing. But I think we owe it as we try to get better relationships with restoration of dams and reservoirs. We have three different divisions in our department that are involved, and we need to kind of coalescing and get more organized so we can communicate to the landowners either restoring or removing dams that the department can have a much more coordinated approach, rather than having them step through all three different division approvals.
that's a good point. As the chairperson you're right I mean we should be facilitating that coordinated effort rather than having landowners go through so many different hoops. There should be much better coordination. We will work on that.
