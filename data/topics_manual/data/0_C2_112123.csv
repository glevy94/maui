Informational Briefing by University of Hawai‘i Biota Survey in Hālawa Stream, O‘ahu
Dr. Yinphan Tsang, University of Hawaiʻi, Associate Professor in Hydrology
Dr. Ayron Strauch introduced Dr. Tsang and her team from the University of Hawaiʻi. She explained the effects of the Navy’s water discharge from the Hālawa Shaft into South Hālawa Stream.
Thank you for your research. Seems like the rising tide floated all the species or it benefited all the species. Will over time the non-native species propose a habitat transforming risk because they outcompete or they are predators of the natives?
That's definitely a very unfortunate situation but that's what we are seeing right now and so far. You are probably already aware that we are experiencing a quite unusual drought situation this year. I think that's also contributing to this unprecedented dry condition that might have increased this environmental stressor like hotter environment and allow those more tolerant invasive species that can stay there while our native is probably not so happy there. So yes, that's likely what's going on right now.
Putting the drought aside, are there strategies that you recommended or that are available to really better reduce that non-native population?
The invasive eradication is challenging in many ways but it's not impossible. There are definitely other efforts I know of in different watersheds. For example Ala Wai watershed has been trying to take out the invasive species but, another thing that we should definitely try to understand is their differences in terms of their habitat usage and different preference. I think we can better create a habitat that is better suited for our native species, at the same time taking out the non-native species to restore our aquatic ecosystem.
Your results are what would be expected, you increase flow you get more recruitment of native species, but you get a hard time getting rid of non- native species. Did you do any studies on mollusks? Hīhīwai? No? Did you do any studies on whether mollusks were able to get back up?
Currently my lab doesn't have a study looking at the mollusk and funny that you asked this. I forgot to point out that the ʻōpae kalaʻole and it was there and then I think there was some sighting going on with other mollusks, but then I was not actually ready to summarize that information, yet. Cory, I saw you light up. You want to say something?
We didn't see any native mollusks. They're pretty cryptic, too. We didn't want to disturb the habitat too much, but there's a lot of non-native mollusks, the quilted melania and other types of snails that were listed on the non-native figures. Unfortunately those were very obvious and very dominant so not likely that many native mollusks around at least in Hālawa Stream that we could tell. We weren't about to flip over all the boulders and rocks though but, there was some rock scrubbing. If there were some present at least on those size rocks they would have showed up in probably the benthic samples at least. We didn't see any.
When they stop putting water into Hālawa Stream, everything will revert back to what it was, correct?
That's definitely something we are concerned with and that was exactly the reason to do this research. This is actually more of a question to Navy. As far as we have learned from the last meeting we had with Navy is that they are planning to discharge the water indefinitely. Please correct me if I misunderstood that. Anyone on the team, is that what I understand correct? I think that's what I understand. Our team does meet with Navy, CWRM, DAR, and Department of Forestry and Wildlife monthly and to checking our results. But that's what we got so far that we are learning the Navy is planning to continue this discharge. Yes, now that we are attracting the native species back, what if they decided one day to discontinue, what does that mean.
When we've had changes in the interim instream flow standards, those were more or less permanent. You could, for example in the Maui streams, you see a return of wildlife and that's probably going to go on indefinitely whereas these are episodic increases in streamflow so my expectation is when you stop it you revert back to the old signature. I guess you would agree with that?
I will agree, actually.
I would say not that it's in high density, but the Tahitian prawns are also a amphidromous migratory taxa, so distribution expanded as well and they were able to climb further upstream the more continuity there was. Again, that's I think what all of us expected but I just want to point out that on the non-native taxes side that those have an ocean larval phase so they are definitely migrating from upstream probably at a higher incidence than it would have been without that water. That's it.
Did I hear correctly that it is the understanding that the Navy will be flushing two million gallons of our water forever indefinitely?
I actually was not aware of their full plan. My understanding is their gag discharge right now still continues on. I don't know when they’re going to stop. The gag discharge right now is 5 million gallons per day, but I wonder if what you meant in terms of two million gallons per day flushing is from a different area and different mechanism.
Oh no, the Navy said they were going to try to get it down to two million but I guess it's still five million a day so that's two billion and counting that they flushed into the stream. My comment to the Commission would be, we really need an answer from the Navy whether they're going to continue even five million or even two million or less a day indefinitely. I think we really need an answer from the Navy. That’s just not sustainable like I said before with the drought we're in and climate change. I do appreciate all the research that you did, thank you so much. Looks like it was a lot of hard work and analysis so I appreciate that.
I know that the Navy, they were taking notes while they heard all the comments. Let's hope they respond to your comments as well.
That's mind-blowing that their solution is continue and if that is their solution even at two million gallons a day I would hope that this Commission would then decrease their allotment or their permit by two million gallons a day because we can't live like this on Oʻahu. Thank you.
This is for our staff, Deputy Manuel and Dr. Strauch. Can you refresh my memory whether we granted the Navy permission to pump Red Hill at 5 mgd for the purpose of plume containment? Is that correct?
That's a groundwater question.
This is where we get confused because I'm seeing you and the stream but it is a groundwater question.
Yeah I'll start, so the Commission didn't take an action to permit that use of water. Their water use permit is for Waiawa and in Red Hill the shaft itself was for their municipal system. So change in use from municipal to then using it as a remediation well to create this capture zone was something that was discussed by the Commission, but the Commission never acted on the water use permits of the Navy.
Then I guess I have a question for Department of Health because it seems to lie in the space between the Commission and Department of Health on when that flushing will end. From my understanding of our last item, that is in the works.
Yes, like I said we don't want to decrease it while they're defueling. Once it's defueled we are in active discussions how to address this after defueling.
Thank you very much Dr. Tsang for your team's great work and the information. Encouraging but also managing expectations, it all depends.
