Request for Approval of the Memorandum of Agreement between the State of Hawaiʻi, Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of State Parks and the Commission on Water Resource Management Regarding Installation and Maintenance of a Deep Monitoring Well and Related Features at Hāpuna Beach State Recreation Area, South Kohala, Hawaiʻi Island
Neal Fujii, CWRM State Drought & Water Conservation Coordinator Staff stated the summary of request to authorize the Deputy Director to enter into a MOA with the Division of State Parks to allow a deep monitor well into the Waimea Aquifer System Area within the Hāpuna Beach Recreation Area.
Do we typically enter into MOAs with ourselves because it's the State with the State. Is that a regular practice?
This is the first one I can think of but I think it was because the Hāpuna Park is also under management by the National Park Service.
Real quick, it’s a requirement. There's, I forget the acronym, but basically there's a conservation easement over this area that National Park Service regulates and so State Parks is the implementor of that conservation easement. Any type of land uses that could impact the recreation of that area have to get approval through National Park Service and also State Parks so this was a formal agreement in consultation with National Park Service that they required in order for them to be very clear on what the extent of this project is within the context of the larger Hāpuna Recreational Area. It's specific to that land use control ultimately that requires this type of MOU and Agreement.
We normally don't do MOAs.
Right, but was that in the report? I think it's germane to have in the record and the minutes are okay just so that we don't set a precedent in here where every time we deal with another State agency we're doing an MOA.
Thank you for that.
Aloha mai kākou, Commissioners. Jonathan Likeke Scheuer. On this particular matter I testified at the September meeting as an individual. I am also here again as an individual. There was a meeting after the September meeting where staff reached out. We discussed some of the issues, I followed up with a long email with nine suggested things that I thought would address the concerns that I had raised. The commitment that this is not trying to discover deep confined groundwater addresses nearly all of the concerns that I have so I'm very appreciative of the changes to the submittal. To be super clear I'm not opposed in theory to trying to discover whether or not there's deep confined groundwater in different places but it should be done in a particular, methodical way as well as towards management of that resource. My largest concern slash question is in the chart that's included in the submittal. A typical deep monitor well plan it says depth shall be as directed by the engineer based on the conditions encountered in the field. I'm just wondering what kind of particular direction and restriction is being given in this authority. Related to that I'll just note that the decision made here is in some ways related to what will come up on item B4, the delegation of authority because if I read before correctly this kind of exploratory well would remain as a delegated authority to the chair, not something that would appear in front of the Commissioners. The chance for the public or practitioners or other people to comment on this in conjunction with the proposal in B4 doesn't exist. I realize this is just an MOA but the way before is written is that there's not allowing for this kind of thing to appear in front of the Commission if there are other concerns associated with the development.
And we'll get into a lot more of the B4 discussion but thank you.
Just noting that those two are related. I'm very appreciative of the staff’s work on this.
Let's take a hard look again. In line with Commissioner Hannahs, let's make sure that the MOA reflects that NPS requirement because it does not.
We will work with finalizing, there's a draft MOA language that we worked on already with National Park Service and State Parks but to make it very clear what that trigger is and why we're executing the MOA, we'll put that in the intent purpose of the MOA or MOU.
MOTION: (MIIKE / KATAYAMA / KAGAWA-VIVIANI) To approve staff submittal. UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED (MIIKE/KATAYAMA/HANNAHS/CHANG/MEYER/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/HO)
