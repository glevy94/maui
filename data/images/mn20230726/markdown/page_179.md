The commission. We just need to be the local partner in this effort. And because the commission already gathers the data from drinking water systems, both surface and groundwater data from irrigation systems, both surface and groundwater data from (inaudible) power systems, now that we've really worked statewide to get water users to report consistently, this data is now available for USGS to bring into their system to code it to their level of consistency for their federal or countrywide analysis.

So with that, the staff recommends that the commission authorize the chairperson to enter into a joint funding agreement between the Commission on Water Resource Management and the US Geological Survey to collect and enter site-specific water use information for the state of Hawaiâ€˜i. This JFA will be funded solely by the USGS with no cost to the commission. Authorize the chairperson to accept further amendments and modifications to the contract agreement as may be necessary to accomplish the goals described here, provided that any amendment or modification does not require additional commission funding. Declare that the project is exempt from EA requirements under HRS Chapter 343 and HAR Chapter 11-200.1.

CHAIR CHANG: Very good. Thank you, Ayron.
