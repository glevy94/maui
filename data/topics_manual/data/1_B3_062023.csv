Good morning.
Item B-3, this is Dean Uyeno again with the Stream Protection and Management Branch presenting Item B-3. And this is requesting approval of the Stream Channel Alteration Permit, SCAP.5974.3, by Castle & Cooke Homes Hawai‘i, Incorporated. The project proposes to convey and discharge on-site stormwater runoff into Kipapa Stream that has been consolidated and treated in the Koa Ridge Stormwater Treatment Facilities. The proposed Drain Line 2, or DL2, is designed to accommodate the peak runoff from the second phase, which is the northern portion of the Koa Ridge Development. The drain line will be approximately 1600 feet in length and will consist of two box culverts that discharge into a 12-foot wide trapezoidal channel with articulated concrete blocks that terminates in a riprap channel lining and concrete rubble masonry stream bank protection at Kipapa Stream. A 10-foot by 8-foot box culvert would be constructed in Row G to connect to the upstream portion of Drain Line 2. And staff stands by its submittal. And if I may just read the recommendation that the commission approve the Stream Channel Alteration Permit application that proposed to convey and discharge on-site stormwater runoff into Kipapa Stream that has been consolidated and treated in the Koa Ridge Stormwater Treatment Facilitieses subject to the standard conditions in Exhibit 3 and the special condition below, which is approval of subject of  approve  excuse me, approval is subject to SHPD concurrence. If SHPD requires conditions, authority shall be delegated to the deputy director to attach those as a condition of the Stream Channel Alteration Permit. And that concludes staff's recommendations.
Thank you.  
Commission, do you have any questions for Dean?  (No response.)  
Dean, I would  I have this little  I have to be careful  concerns regarding the SHPD. Do they ultimately send you a letter of concurrence?  
Yes. It may take a little while. I was in communication with Susan Lebo on this one, and she did   
Okay.  
They were trying to push through this thing. They did admit, admittedly, that they were a little behind.  
Okay, very good. Thank you so much. Neil.  
Dean, what's the risk of this stormwater runoff containing chemicals, petroleum in particular, from the roadway systems or from which they're gathered and depositing that into our  our streams I would  actually, I'll probably defer to the consultant who is on the call, but my understanding of the stormwater retention facilities is that they will  they are intending to construct detention basins upstream to settle out any  any particulate matter and all of that.
Particulate, but not necessarily, you know, chemical that's 
Right. And maybe the consultant can speak to that more in detail.
Thank you.
Is that Mr. Russell Arakaki? Are you the consultant?
Yes, I am.
Okay, go ahead.
Good morning, Chair, Members of the Commission. My name is Russell Arakaki. I work for Park Engineering, and I am the principal design engineer for the Koa Ridge Off-Site Drain Line No. 2. To answer the question about chemicals, the Koa Ridge project is designing stormwater best management practices to meet the City and County of Honolulu Department of Planning and Permitting's requirements for water quality, so we are following their rules. As far as the design, we are designing infiltration methods to get stormwater runoff in the ground where appropriate. There's also filtration systemsIt could be either vegetated filtration or these manufactured treatment devices. So that's all designed or will be designed as part of the Koa Ridge Drainage System. City's reviewing it, they have been reviewing and approving construction plans for the roadways and subdivisions.
Thank you, Mr. Arakaki. So in your professional view, it'll be effective in mitigating any of those concerns?
Yes, it should be.
Thank you.
That's  that's the best technology that's available now, yeah.
I have a question. This is maybe for Stream Protection, or maybe Dean. What's the sort of ecological status of Kipapa Stream?
Kipapa Stream is a fairly  so it's a tributary to Waikele Stream, which is a pretty urbanized stream. Ecologically  let me see. I don't have it on hand, but it's  it's pretty filled with invasive species, especially the lower reaches. If I recall correctly  I'm trying to pull up the  sorry, if you'd give me a minute, I'm trying to pull up the  there was also a biological  a stream assessment that was completed by ECOS as part of the  what's it called  environmental impact statement, and they basically found that there'd be no impacts to the biologicas on the stream.
Great. Yeah, yeah. It'd just be nice to sort of have a little bit more detail around it to demonstrate that. So, okay, I mean, I don't know this stream, so it would help to understand because, I mean, a big construction project will have short-term and long-term implications for this.
If I can kind of just add on, Dean, and maybe Kaleo, what I am finding is that we don't  we don't have really good baseline data on a lot of our streams, so, you know, it's very difficult. We're all  and Mr. Arakaki, I don't question your  your comments; however, I think scientific data is gonna be really helpful to us in the long run. I am  I believe if we had good stream gauges  is there a possibility that we could ask  or maybe I should ask you, Mr. Arakaki, given  given the project that you're doing, are you guys willing to put in a stream gauge in Kipapa to at least give us some good data to monitor the impacts? We hope you are absolutely correct; no impacts by this activity in the stream, but a  anecdotal is nice, but having some scientific measure  so we have a really hard time, the state, putting on stream gauges, but is that a possibility that you could do that? Oh, Ayron, what do you think?  
(Inaudible) to let him dance(Laughter.)  
Well, only if he's gonna say yes, he can do it.  (Laughter.)  
You're open to  well, I've  go ahead, Ayron, introduce yourself.  
Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection Management Branch.  
Yes.  
Waikele Stream is monitored   
Okay.  
long-term monitoring stations across the state, but it's also heavily regulated.  
Okay.  
There are other upstream diversions. When you say monitored, Kipapa Stream has been monitored in terms of flow, but you're interested in more the ecological impacts.  
Yes, yes, yes.  
Which a U.S. stream gauge is not gonna help you with.  
Okay. So what will help us with that?  
Encouraging DAR or the legislature to fund a stream program in the Division of Aquatic Resources.  
Wayne. 
Chair, may I ask a question, please?  
Yes  
Mr. Arakaki, once the stormwater is collected and passed through whatever filtration or processing that you're planning, is that covered by NPDES?  
Yes, it is. It will be. It'll be under the City and County's NPDES permit.  
So, isn't there a requirement to measure water quality in the discharge?  
I'm not sure if measurement and analysis of stormwater is in their NPDES program. I would have to get back to you.  
So the City and County monitors across the island to ensure compliance with the NPDES program, but, you know, they're not monitoring daily, they're monitoring   
But isn't the permit issued to   
(inaudible) every year.  
a system, a person?  
The  it's the accumulation of every point (inaudible). So it's  so, like, for every  in the lake (inaudible), for example, every storm drain outfall, there is a permit for the accumulative impact of that.  
But isn't one of the requirements looking at analysis of what is in that discharge?  
Not on a specific basis, no, and not  and this is a DOH issue that doesn't fall under us, but they  they don't monitor specifically any individual outfall.  
Should they be?  
That  that would be a monitoring burden that would bankrupt the island.  
Can I ask a question then of her, DOH?  
Yes.  
Commissioner, I mean, how does DOH  just for our understanding, how does DOH kind of consider the NPDES setting of a project like this? This project or a project like this.  
So I've been out of the Clean Water Branch, which manages the NPDES program, for over ten years, so from what I recall, the municipal separate storm sewer system, the MS4 permit, requires the permittee, the City and County, to  to pre-  to impose BMPs on themselves as well as like those construction projects where you see the  the BMPs in front of the catch basin inlets, things like that. And then, as Mr. Arakaki was saying, the constructed filtration systems, the actual monitoring of the dischargte waters  I don't recall the frequency of that monitoring, but you need to understand that runoff into the storm drains is going to be varying on  on a daily basis because you don't know if somebody had a breakdown on the road and caused an oil spill that might have happened there. So there's monitoring that is done, but I don't know how we can tie it into 
At this point, it's going through a very specific system 
Yes.
with an outfall 
Yes.
that is very specific. So it's being engineered to certain standards.
Yeah.
And I guess to Mr. Arakaki, what are those standards? I mean, you must be anticipating some kind of input in terms of water quality. So as you're going through the process of treating the water, are you just looking at solids, or are you looking at other things?
No, it's  it's solids such as sediment.
Right, soluble solids.
Trash debris  right, trash debris. But I think the BMPs that meet the City and County rules also look at the removal of other chemical constituents. So one example is a vegetated swale or just a grass swale where you're allowing the runoff to flow through the soil, removing whatever contaminants that are in there.
Okay.
Ayran, can I kind of follow up with you? I am  at DLNR, we not only look at  I mean, we do a lot of  DAR has a lot of fishing activities. Right? We get a lot of concerns raised by fishermen that they get criticized for impacts to the near shore waters by their fishing activity. We regulate the fishing, but they're saying it's  a lot of it is the mauka activities. So when a permittee comes before us like on a project like this, what  what mechanisms do we have to try to utilize this process to  because you said, oh, DAR could go to the legislature and develop a  you know, like a stream program, but what  and I  and I want to be very reasonable to  to the applicants. I mean, I'm not gonna hold them responsible, but what  what is it that  is there anything that we can do in our process to help more equitably distribute or at least monitor impacts of different activities that may  that may have an effect on the streams that eventually flow down to the nearshore waters?
So I think there are two not unrelated issues, but one is the ecosystem 
Yes. 
the biota and monitoring the biota, and the other is water quality and the impacts on the ecosystem both in the stream and in the near shore. And best management practices, which they're very well articulated, that control, say, sediment and nutrients in runoff would benefit both the in-stream and nearshore. But as a  take a step back and look at the entire watershed, managing impervious surfaces, managing invasive species in the forest, managing riparian zones, which we, as a whole, don't do a great job of. There are definitely specific instances where the state is doing an excellent job managing the forest, but we have lots of forests that don't fall under the state, and so  and whether it's on private land or whether it's on City County, Federal, coordinating management activities to reduce runoff to increase native vegetation, to improve the health of our ecosystems both within the stream and in the near shore would benefit a host of values Fisheries, cultural practices, whatever, and both from a water quality perspective and an ecosystem perspective. So what can CWRM do? I think I'm going to get (inaudible), but we do our best.
No, you're  absolutely. But I'm looking more at like  and bear with me, Mr. Arakaki, you're not  you know, I mean, I'm not just looking at targeting you, but I mean, applicants come before us, and they're proposing activities. We have conditions, and people can do BMPs, and they can  but unless we have good data to monitor, we now have  you know, to have a baseline as to, okay, at this point in time, this is the condition of  of the stream or the water quality or the ecosystem. However, over time, we've noticed, based upon new information or some measurements, the changes. Now, that may be due far beyond just  just this particular project, but I think  how to  sharing the opportunity of participation by our community members, including our developers, to help the state better manage our resources. And I'm  I'm just kind of struggling But I think, Kaleo, as a matter of policy  and I'm not going to just pick on Mr. Arakaki, but I think we need to kind of think about that, you know, as conditions. What  what is it that we can ask the applicant that comes before us? And it might be contributing to a fund so that we can work with DAR on doing, you know, better  better management. But I just think that the opportunity presents itself when we're going through an application on the known activities that could have an impact on  on water quality, ecosystem, and  I'm just  you know, how do we as  as citizens of this state collectively try to do  to do better.
Maybe just  I totally get it, and we've talked about these issues 
Yeah, yeah
What is before us and I think what 
Yeah.
kind of limits us in certain situations, and this is maybe where statutory amendments 
Yeah, yeah.
or other types of rules are required, is the SCAP is a construction permit. It's a two-year permit 
Yeah, yeah.
specific to that, and so a lot of the conditions that are recommended 
Sure.
are tied to that period of time.
Yeah, yeah.
What you're talking about is like pre, during, and post 
Right, right.
kind of monitoring and compliance. And so, tying in other conditions that go beyond that two-year period, we have to have a conversation about how to make that happen, right?
Yeah.
And what are  what are the tools available to us. But understanding like these individual projects are all part of this larger ecosystem 
Right, right.
ahupua'a and the moku that we work within, and we all have impacts, whether positive or negative, on those resources. So totally open to strategize 
Okay.
and look at opportunities, and then  and hear you, basically.
Okay. I do want you guys to think about it 'cause, I mean, I want to be equitable like  you know, this project has a very limited, like, life and potential impact, but if we keep on kicking the can down the road, I mean, we'll never 
There's cumulative impacts 
Yeah.
yeah, over time.
Exactly, so  but I don't know how to differentiate that.
I have a thought and a suggestion.
Yeah.
As an educator and also just watching the color of Mānoa Stream change over the last week very quickly with rain and no rain, would it be  would this applicant be willing to  and I've seen people do this with the telecam, like ecologists put a camera on a  on a plant so that you can just watch it as it flowers. You know, would the applicant be willing to maybe work with a local school  'cause that's Mililani, right, right nearby?
Yeah.
You know, I mean, potentially work  for educational and outreach purposes, put a camera above the project site and below, and just let people kind of watch the stream. It's not  I mean, it is a form of data, but it's 
Yeah.
Maybe there's a better idea, but I just wanted to put it out there as a way for people to engage with their streams. 'Cause I'm currently working on urban equality. On Maui, we have people who are organized, who are constantly watching the stream, who are in the stream. We don't really have that on Oahu, and so we forget that the stream exists and don't care about it, don't (inaudible) put cash into it on all kinds. So I  I think, you know, would people be willing to entertain that as an idea for  for the duration of the project?
I mean, I think that's an excellent  I think for me, it's  the community needs to feel a sense of ownership to these resources. If they don't see it, they don't know about it, and who best but  but kids. But it does make a difference, and I think  I'm just trying to find different opportunities and venues and platforms where, one, we're not only engaging and educating, but we're also getting good data for us to make better-informed decisions because that's  that is my  you know, there's so much unknown, I mean, I don't even know what questions to ask. But I think when  when a project comes before us 
I don't know when.
you know, sort of that shared responsibility. So I don't know, Mr. Arakaki, you  I think you're getting  this is like, I only came in here for this permit, what  what is all this about? But, I mean, I think  I'm hoping you're hearing. I  obviously, we've got a lot, you know, more to think about with the  within the department, but I think you kind of hear some of our sentiments. I don't know if you have any thoughts or comments.
I just want to add that  I did mention we're following the city's rules. Part of that rule allows the use of manufactured treatment devices, so these are prefabricated units; they also remove nutrients, heavy metals, other hydrocarbons, other contaminants, so that's also being designed with this drainage system.
And that I think is significant, onecomparison between someone who's using sort of this   this less intrusive material versus others who are doing traditional construction. Is there a difference on the impacts to our  our ecosystem? I  I don't know. All I'm suggesting is if there's a mechanism for us to utilize these applications and these projects as they come before us to sort of share in this inquiry.  
And maybe  maybe if I can, Chair,and maybe a recommendation is we can maybe tap City and County of Honolulu as well as Department of Health's Clean Water Branch to maybe come in and use their, you know, NPDES permit as a way to kind of share, right, the BMPs, the technologies, the work that they have and are currently doing. And then maybe areas where they need more help   
Yeah.  
or more data, and that's where maybe we could fill the gap on the policy side. Maybe that's a recommendation I can propose and can bring it  bring them to the commission and see if they're willing to engage at that level.  
I just want to be constructive, but I   
Yeah.  
I also realize DLNR, we don't have enough resources to do what needs to be done, but we know  
Well, I  I appreciate your line of discussion, and it gets to, really, if having this body be more informed as to what those best practices are so that when different consultants or different applicants come before us, we can kind of 
Right.
check their proposal against our knowledge. But right now our  I think our knowledge may be 
Right.
you know, fragmented across the spectrum of membership. And I'm wondering if there's some space or a way we can have an informational briefing from the industry, from the regulatory bodies, as you have suggested, Kaleo, from landowner developers in terms of what are the  what should we expect of modern developments these days? What is the highest, you know, standard for what we're creating that would really allow for the development of lands and  in ways that really are beneficial to the environment and not harmful to the environment.
Right.
So I think there's  a lot has changed, I mean, in the industry, and I'm  they're attending to the impacts that they have, and I think it's incumbent upon them to raise the standard to be  to create a competitive edge for themselves as consultants, as developers. And so let's get a briefing and figure out what those  where they are.
Yeah, and then  I'll just jump in. And this  this is actually really exciting because water quality is  is going to be the next  the focus, in my opinion, of this commission and Department of Health 
Right, right.
in the next couple of years.
Right.
With new emerging contaminants and regulations, but also just how do we holistically manage that? And then, as you mentioned, Chair, the real ripple effect it has, the mauka-to-makai connection on all of our resources, all of our programs here at DLNR. It's real, and finding out how those are connected is going to be really, really important.
Very true. And I guess I'm also just trying to be more equitable. I mean, we cannot hold the last developer responsible for all of the past. So how do we share some of that management responsibility, whether it's monitoring, whether it's, you know, BMPs? But I recognize that we do have to be  we have to be more proactive. We are constantly reacting to a crisis, so how do we have good information to be more proactive and have  make an informed decision, but also share proportionately with those that come before us to utilize our public resources. And, you know, how do we get them to help share in that, that opportunity to meet these challenges, but Oh. And thank you for entertaining sort of my  my little  what I'm  I am trying to use every opportunity to help supplement DLNR meet its goals and its missions. But thank you very much And thank you, Mr. Arakaki. Is there  do you have anybody else from your team that would like to speak or  you know, because I noticed you do have several from Castle & Cooke that are here as well as from PAR Engineering.
There's one other person from Engineering Concepts, also a design consultant. I don't think Castle & Cooke is on the  on the video.
Okay, okay.
Well, actually there  can you just  because I didn't pull it out mentally from the submittal, just explain  you mentioned you're aligned with best management practices, and you gave more detail about it's not just a sediment retention basin, but there are more filtration processes. Do you have any pictures? I mean, I think I saw a, you know, kind of conceptual design. So we can better understand, you know, what  what you folks are doing and  and how it is  you know, it's  you're not just trying to do minimal compliance, you're actually trying to really clear the  the stormwater.
Let's see if I can pull up a website. 
You're asking someone older to (inaudible). 
And I'm gonna see if I can share my screen. Oh, I  okay, I'm disabled from sharing the screen.  
Can we do that, Kathy? 
Yeah. You should be able to share now. 
Got it. Can you see my screen now?  
Oh, yes. 
Okay. This is one product that we are  Castle & Cooke is installing. Stormwater goes in this chamber, and it gets filtered through these cartridges  
Okay. 
which removes the sediment, trash, debris, as well as heavy metals, hydrocarbons. So that this is just one product.  
Just gotta be sure you don't release the Kraken. 
Yes.  
So you've gotta clean it a bit before it gets  gets to that stage, right?  
That's right. So maintenance, removal of trash and debris. Let's see. This kind of shows stormwater going through the chamber, but there's also a trash and debris collection area here; these are the filters, and then it goes out downstream to Kipapa Stream.  
Compared to what comes off the stream.  
Yeah.  
(Inaudible)  
What's the capacity of that? Because, like, you know, larger   
Sure.  
could easily exceed that.  
Yeah. The capacity is nowhere near the peak flows that we're designing the off-site drainage system for. It's typically  it's very small. It's a smaller storm, one inch, one inch of rainfall.  
But then the swales, too, should also function as well. I guess I'm thinking most sediment transport happens in the bigger events anyways, and so if you're only designing for the small events and  you're kind of maybe missing some of the most significant   
Sediment shouldn't be released. Whatever gets in here, the  the city's design criteria is not to treat the  peak flow, you know, whether it's the ten-year or  or larger storms.
Okay. So it sounds like a conversation with the city.
Yeah, I mean  yeah.
Russell, can I add to that?
Okay. Doraine Young is on.
Okay.
Okay. I'm Doraine Young, and I'm with Engineering Concepts. Sorry, I was having problems with my camera. But I wanted to add that the reason why the city chose a one-inch rainstorm is that's usually 80 percent of the runoff that occurs. So that's the reason why the one-inch storm is used.
Yeah.
Makes perfect logic, right? Eighty percent of the runoff.
Probably. Eighty percent of the runoff happens two percent of the time, you know, so, yeah. I mean, if the coral's getting blanketed, it's happening at the high end. So that sounds like a good conversation to have across the city (inaudible).
Yeah. I think it'll be good to talk city. I mean, even all of the counties on how they're managing stormwater. I mean, we haven't engaged in stormwater, but it is a big  a big issue that we have to talk about and falls within the context of the commission Water Resource Division. So we'll  we'll try to bring forward, you know, this thread of conversation to the commission. It's something that we haven't really focused on, but I do think it does have impacts on the commission's overall policy setting and decision making, so 
All right. Russell, when you designed this system, you must have looked at the effluent that you are planning to handle in the one-inch events. Have you  what's the analysis of that water sample?
We did not do any water quality analysis. Currently, it's not a requirement.
But you're designing a system to do something.
Correct, correct.
But you don't know what you're gonna  that something is that you've gotta handle, right?
That's right. So all the (Laughter.)
All the test  yeah. All 
I mean, shouldn't you sortwhat you're gonna handle even at the one-inch events?
Umm.
I'm assuming that it had historical one-inch flows or some flows currently.
Correct. All of the testing of these systems that we're specifying are done by the manufacturer, and they follow guidelines of, let's say, New Jersey and other jurisdictions. So they need to meet the water quality treatment requirements that were established. This is all approved by EPA and then passed down to Department of Health, and then on to the City and County as part of their NPDES program. So at this time, there's no requirement to look at or measure the pollutants that enter the system and leave the treatment system.
Okay. No, that's fine. A different conversation, but thank you.
I know  Russell, I'm sure this is much more than you had thought you were gonna get into.(Laughter.)
He's like, Am I here for the (inaudible)? No, we appreciate you, your patience, and, you know, answering our questions. Any more questions, comments, Commission?(No response.)
Anybody else, Kathy, in the audience? 
(Inaudible.)
Commission, are you ready for the vote? Call for the vote.
Move to approve.
Second.
Okay. The motion has been moved and seconded to approve staff's recommendation for Item B-3. All in favor, say aye.(Response.)
Any opposed?(No response.)
The motion has been unanimously approved. Thank you very much, Russell and your team. Thank you, Dean.
MOTION (HANNAHS/KATAYAMA) To approve B-3 as submitted. UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED
