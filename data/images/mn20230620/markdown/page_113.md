particular commission objectives, yeah, there's -- there's really -- there's really nothing that we look at in terms of a larger group. Although, you know, informally, we do consult with several geologists throughout the state about geologic issues as they pertain to monitor wells. Otherwise, commission staff is advisory to the Field Tank -- well, we're a part of the Fuel Tank Advisory Committee as well as subject matter experts.

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: Well, Ryan, is there an opportunity -- one of the, to me, issues is that your groundwater staff is sort of limited. Could we avail the Navy's conscience and hopefully, you know, some of their accountability to help improve getting groundwater data to you to -- you know, what would normally be your function in doing it, but take advantage of that if they're putting in, you know, 35 sentinel wells around the area? Can we --

MR. IMATA: No, that's --

COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA: -- task them to do more?

MR. IMATA: That's a great question and -- and actually, timely for me to let you know that the legislature approved four positions under groundwater regulation for that very purpose. So, you know, my thing has always been I would prefer for us to be collecting the data rather than the Navy to be collecting the data because, you know, validation -- data validation is an issue. And for us to do that stuff
