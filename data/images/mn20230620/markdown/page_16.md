we want to incorporate into future updates as it's a huge component that is often missing from these plans.

COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: Thank you. And I'll wait to hear more from Maui, Maui officials. Thank you.

CHAIR CHANG: Okay. Oh, go ahead, Joanna.

COMMISSIONER SETO: For Item 1, is there a due date for that summary?

MS. ROTH: So it's in process now, but I can let Eva comment more specifically on where they're at, but I believe it's in process, and they should have it done in six to nine months.

COMMISSIONER SETO: Okay, thank you.

CHAIR CHANG: My question -- my only question is, what is the impact if we don't approve this plan?

MS. ROTH: That's a good question. Well, it's already being used by the county for a lot of their capital improvement projects and planning efforts. So if we do not approve it, I believe they're still going to use it in some way to guide their process and what -- and what they hope to achieve with water resource protection on the island. Again, defer it probably to the county to provide more specific information about how not approving at this time would impact the outcome. I know that they've worked very hard many years --

CHAIR CHANG: Yes.
