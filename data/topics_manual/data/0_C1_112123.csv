Department of Defense Updates on the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility Defueling, Remediation and Closure, Red Hill Shaft Recovery and Monitoring, and Monitoring Well Development and Water Data
MajGen Hashimoto, VADM John Wade (Joint Task Force-Red Hill), RDML Steve Barnett (Navy Region Hawaiʻi), RDML Jeff Kilian (Navy Facilities Engineering Systems Command-Pacific) The presenters briefed the Commission on defueling, conditions for closure, and environmental remediation initiatives currently in effect.
As you complete your mission, will you be preparing any kind of final report that will be transition or also publicly available about what you accomplished during the defueling?
Yes, at the end we will certainly put together a final report. There will be an internal DOD final report but also a publicly facing document. One of the key things coming out of the 2021 situation was transparency and we have again done our very best to be as transparent as possible. I think there's a lot of lessons learned here that can be applied not only to the Navy Closure Task Force but also Hawaiʻi and the remainder of the Pacific and quite honestly when it comes to environmental stewardship and the importance to connect with the public and the community which supports the military. The symbiotic relationship I believe, there's lessons to be learned globally with all of our facilities that we have in supporting our national defense.
It's good to hear that the personnel will transition, 15 to 20. What percent of your team is that? It’s going to be a smaller team for closure.
Admiral Barnett can talk to it. He has the slides and the composition of his team.
The other question I had or maybe observation is in your dialogues with community, the Navy has a certain definition of closure and you're trying to articulate that here but is it congruent? And where is it different from the public's perception of what the word closure means and looks like?
That's a fair point and I'm going to defer that to Admiral Barnett since he's one, responsible for it but the other piece to it because I don't want to just leave that hanging right is that there's a lot of uncertainty for closure because there are still unknowns with respect to what the facility will turn into or become. There is a National Defense Authorization Act to do a beneficial reuse study. The Department of Health has mandated a review. There's also an internal Department of Defense so whatever course is directed which will not be fuel right will then drive what closure will look like. If it becomes, let's just say an alternate energy facility compared to a museum or just completely shut down it will then define differences in what closure means, if that makes sense.
I know it's an ongoing discussion and it's later on, but I think just recognizing that our technical definitions and I think you've stressed that there's defueling but it doesn't remove all the fuel and that closure is a different phase that still involves fuel.
Yes, ma'am. If I could just highlight, the Joint Task Forces in our military are established for expeditionary means for hard complex problems that require cross-functional teams. The Secretary of Defense and AWMAC felt that a Joint Task Force was the right approach to remove the preponderance of fuel because that was the biggest threat for the community as I said for today, the future generations. But this notion that we’ll get every drop out within the next 60 days after gravity defueling is done, it's just not possible. It's a physics problem, but what the Department of Defense is absolutely committed to do is to continue to do so as expeditiously or safely as possible and to ensure that the controls are in place to ensure that we don't have another mishap. That's why this transition, the turnover, and every control measure to ensure a deliberate and methodical approach is being taken.
To date, the defueling seems to have gone pretty well and congratulations, that's great.
We have more work to do.
I understand that. More specifically 60,000 and another 32,000 gallons.
We still have the fuel at the bottom of the tanks and the pipelines, too.
Sledge, that sort of thing. Anyway, congratulations that's great. Last year seems to have been a different tone and a different methodology involved and that's just great. I have a question really relating to the removal of the pipelines, the removal of the residual fuel and the sludge. How does that happen? Mechanically, I envisage sort of pipes being cleansed with a pig and forcing the material out the end and then perhaps a solvent or some sort of other material being used, all of which is carefully disposed of and through a same solid tight pipeline process. How is that going to go because that sounds a little stickier than...
Again, it goes to the complexity that I highlighted, but I'm going to defer that question to Admiral Barnett when he gets to his, he's going to talk to that because well it's important. If you go back to slide 2 and you see the integrated master schedule and I appreciate the feedback, sir that you highlighted that there's been a methodical and deliberate approach. It's been a systems engineering approach to be honest with you and the Navy Closure Task Force is working an integrated master plan, an integrated master schedule that again will sequence all these activities, the preparations for and the actual execution. I referred to what we did to get to where we are and what we're doing right now with a symphony. It's going to be the same thing and it's different instruments at different tempos at different crescendos and volumes. That’s what's really going to have to happen and it's got to be planned, it's got to be methodical because this is a no fail mission and so Admiral Barnett will talk to that during his slides.
There are two areas that are perhaps longer term, maybe a little stickier perhaps. One is of course the remediation of the aquifer through skimming or treatment or whatever. What are your plans in that respect? Secondly what sort of programs are you putting in place for outreach to the people that have been exposed through drinking water systems and otherwise to these petrochemical issues?
I'll let Admiral Killian talk a little bit about the remediation process. I think there’s a slide...he can explain that. As far as the medical side we're working with our partners DHA on those folks that have been exposed. I know they're at our meetings and they're working that process. I can get you more information on exposure. I know they're working with Department of Health also. They’re tracking them. I think they're doing a, it's not a survey, it's called a registry. I know that's in process, too so I can get you more information on that.
That'd be great. Roughly how many people are involved in that exposure?
I wouldn't want to venture to guess on that but, I can get you that information. I can put...
I don't need to know that. I'm just curious. It's a large number.
Thank you for your report. The public outreach seems a simple phrase but it's a really difficult challenge. Have you identified clear stakeholder groups or constituencies that you're trying to impact and have clear goals for each of those system users? Certainly some stakeholders like us or the Board of Water Supply and so forth, the Department of Health would be another layer, the environmental community, the community leadership of political business and grassroots cultural stakeholders. “Ola i ka wai,” that’s our motto for this Commission so, it's kind of a sacred resource. Each of those has a constituency, to just blast things out to the general public one way is... One way to approach that if you segmented those and really have clear outcome targets of what you'd like to achieve with each of those. It'd be good to see those, to see how systematically you are with each of these major important constituencies you're trying to rebuild trust. I know it kind of starts with you, it's going to finish with the remediation team because you've got community outreach on both sides. You'll go so far to closure then they've got to pick it up in terms of the longer-term remediation.
That's a great question and it's funny that you mention that because I've talked to Admiral Wade about that. He's going to give me his rolodex. [inaudible] I'm going to have the same strategic outreach coordinator, not a military person but who's going to be plugged into that. What I've done in my other regions which I think is going to work well here is I developed the bullseye and it was a bullseye type of chart. We can sit down and figure that. You’re spot on, sir and that's key to it. The intent is to get to those individuals, those nodes where I can make sure the information is getting out. We are working a play and believe it or not that's one of the bigger areas that we're sourcing up right now is our strategic engagement team. That's one of the first ones, that and the knowledge management. Obviously we got engineering here too, but those are the folks that I need to get in front of me but, I showed them a bullseye and I said, hey, this is what I used in other places, how do we count it?”
If I may, my mission from the Secretary of Defense through Admiral Aquino has been the defueling of the technical, the engineering but also the communication piece with the community and multiple stakeholders. Not only those that may be very supportive but even critics. It's equally important and respect their positions. You have to look at this holistically. With this new supplement the Secretary of Defense has added a new mission to me and that mission is to ensure a deliberate turnover, so again the processes, the procedure. I have a team that's dedicated to this engagement because it's so critically important to inform what we're doing and why but then also to compassionately listen to and have a better understanding the concerns of the community and our military families. Admiral Barnett like he highlighted, they’re going to take that playbook and then build on it because it's going to be for the long term, as you noted, and has a little bit more dimensions. I'm defueling, but he's going to have the closure but the environmental remediation. What closure means to one person may be different to another as you highlighted, ma’am. It's going to be equally important. That's the art, the science and then the art of the mission.
I just want to express appreciation for your acknowledgement that what you hear is as important as what you say. That you want to send a signal that builds confidence. Let people know that you're listening to them and record those thoughts and address those as best you can, in our experience.
You said your team will be 200 individuals so basically maybe 10% of the staff will be from JTF. What positions, what responsibilities are those staff? Are they engineers or are they also the community face?
It's going to be both.
That 10% will have perhaps some heavy responsibility to sort of transmitting that information. The other question I have is you say, “we will be here for the long term,” but in Hawaiʻi that perhaps given the Navy's structure and the tours of duty, what does that mean when you say that?
My task force is going to be primarily, I think of the 200 or so folks, the majority will be staying, that's the continuity. It'll be about 32 individuals that will be working here. There is continuity in the forces that are there. Obviously I'll be here as long as I'm ordered here and I will tell you I'm probably going to be here longer than any other place I've been, so that’s good.
Longer than 10 months.
He's been here longer than 10 months.
I’ve been here longer than 10 months. That's the continuity there and that's one thing that I want to stress to the community is that I like to think I'm important, but what’s more important are the folks that are here or the teammates that are behind. I'm just here to help move barriers. That's the key for that and additionally, my strategic engagement person will be reaching out to each of you individually to discuss the case with you. We have to make sure we take all the information in, the good ideas so we make sure we’re on track.
Just to confirm, the team that will transfer over is engineering and community engagement but, I think an important concern that I can hear is that are the monitoring staff or people who are knowledgeable about safety and monitoring, is that a significant part? Especially because of the connection with DOH.
Will you mention that?
When it comes to my turn.
I'm just getting ahead of schedule. One more and maybe it's been said elsewhere but can you speak a little bit to your experience closing other facilities because this is a different beast.
This is a different beast. I know the Navy at large has experience with this. I haven't had any personal experience with it. I think what I bring to the table is the eye to be able to look at the experience just because I've been in regions for so long but also able to reach back to DC to talk to my friends. I don't have any personal experience but the Navy has closed a couple of facilities. I think one was in Point Loma and the other was in [inaudible]. Once again back to a region I’m familiar with if I can bring back lessons learned.
Perhaps build some knowledge transfer from those and I think showing the public.
And the public engagement space.
I just wanted to make a statement. I have always been somewhat of a critic only because Admiral Wade was singularly focused on defueling, Admiral Barnett has not only closure and remediation but he also has his other duties in region. I was concerned about that and I've had discussions with Admiral Barnett about that and he has assured me that if I have any issues and I've told him that I would be critical of that and that I really need him to be as focused and his team to be as focused as the defueling team was. Also recognizing that it should be of the same high priority that defueling had and we want it to be done in as expeditiously a fashion as we can, recognizing that we have the safety of the aquifer that needs to be taken into consideration. He has assured me that he will have that same focus and we will hold him to it.
Please do. I'll tell you that I have a strong staff on the Navy of the Hawaiʻi side and they understand that. I have two chiefs of staff, got one admiral, but you will have my commitment. Yes, there are a lot of things but I've got teammates that work for me whether you’re talking wastewater treatment facilities, talking other things. There's a lot of things that I can kind of look over and give guidance on but I know how important this is.
I appreciate that. I just want to follow up. I had an opportunity to meet with you. Kathy Ho and I remember the days of Kahoʻolawe. This is a very different Navy than then but it's everything. The walk is in the talk, so greatly appreciate the candor, the recognition, lessons learned and I'm hearing a lot of really good things, but I recognize as I transition from one administration to the next, there needs to be a seamless transition. As Admiral Wade transfers over to Admiral Barnett a lot of the questions I'm hearing from Aurora and others about community outreach. We wanted to try to provide a platform here so communities can get updated, but I just want to confirm that there is a seamless transition between personnel and messaging that goes from Joint Task Force, the defueling over to the closure and remediation, that that messaging continues on as well as the continuity of this because in Hawaii everything's about relationships. You develop a relationship and the challenge has been a lot of times with the Navy every two years that changes. I appreciate the fact that you have the institutional knowledge and commitment from your civilian staff who will continue on that but again the faces who interact with the community, are those also being transitioned from Admiral Wade to Admiral Barnett, that team of community engagement people? Because the last thing the community needs is community fatigue and there's just another person that I'm going to meet. Is there continuity with the community faces of the Navy who engages on behalf of the Navy with the with the rest of the community?
I can jump in real quick. To be clear, I say this humbly but I have become the face of defueling. Admiral Barnett will become the face of closure. It's just because he's going to be out there like I was and just knowing him and we're neighbors and we've known each other for years that's his personality. That's for full transparency. General Okamura who is my director of strategic engagement, he must return to the Army, but he will turn over with a counterpart who will be responsible for the engagement for the community working under Admiral Barnett. There will be a transition of people but the mission will still be the same. The process will be the same and then if I can now turn over to you (General Hashimoto) because you have the umbrella of working in PACOM. If you can then highlight your...
I think what you'll find and not to get too far ahead of who the new General Okamoto is, you already know her. She's a longtime resident, local girl. She used to be part of the Marine Corps family, she now works for the Navy. I have full confidence in her and a multi-generational resident of Hawaiʻi and has the right touch. I think you’ll be very, very pleased with her efforts.
Community members want to be candid and they probably aren't going to approach Admiral Barnett, but the people who are actually on the ground doing the outreach. Is there continuity with that group of people from one mission to the next?
What I'll tell you is that for instance on my Navy region Hawaiʻi side we have individuals, community plans and liaisons officers, we call them civil officers. These are the folks that they're at the community meetings, they're out at the neighborhood boards and we're at these boards and Admiral Wade would send his team over. They would be at the board together, so there will be some continuity at the grassroots level. To a certain extent where, hey this is the same person that was there doing defueling, would be that continuity in there. Then we're doing something called a left seat, right seat turnover which is where his folks are in one seat, my new folks are sitting next to him and they're out there doing introductions seeing each other. Those new faces then, because as we know in any organization whether I can think of operational side whether it’s flying or surface warfare actions or things, it's the transitions that you have to watch out for. It's the transitions going from one phase to another. That's where you on a scale of 1 to 10, you probably got to be 11 or 12 during the transitions because that's where things fall into cracks. My team is aware of that, but I think the left seat, right seat sitting next to their counterpart, meeting, talking story, getting those relationships so then say, okay get out of here, we got it.
I think the assistance of a playbook also helps with the transition. You got the best playbook we've seen so far and when somebody comes in, they're not freelancing. We're going back to the script.
I was just wondering is somebody going to address the long-term, the organization that will be in there for the long term to monitor the health of the aquifer? And what resources would they have available to them for that?
Yes, sir. Admiral Killian will address that with you and I'll make sure he does.
The new Red Hill plant that's being designed, what would the design capacity be there?
We would look to meet 10 to 12 million gallons per day. Historically coming out of Red Hill, we've pulled 5 to 6 million gallons. We can go back in our records and look where we pulled more but essentially it’ll be a 10 to 12 million gallon pull.
What I'm hearing and not quite seeing but I'm hearing, that you have an implicit goal of making sure that this system is safe and that it meets a certain quality. The more you make that explicit the better and to do that, number one, you gather data. That's the purpose of the sampling, it's not just the number of samples that you do but it's the knowledge that you have about the safety and the purity of the source. You do the sampling for a reason and you can share that. Secondly, you have a response plan. It'd be good to see what your response plan is, that samples are going to come in from here to there and when they reach certain thresholds it triggers an action plan, I assume on your part. It'd be good to see that. You told us how many with the number of samples. What did the samples tell us? If we laid that data out it would give confidence that a lot of stuff is okay within the safety area and when it's not, here's our response plan to that. Third you have a commitment to transparency through all these community outreach things to tell people what you're doing, but I think you had that goal framework of the overall goal of having a safe resource and you handle that by gathering data by responding in cases of need and being transparent about it. I think a framework like that would help the public understand.
I appreciate that great input. When we come back next meeting I'll bring a framework with me but I'll speak to it right now. Of the samples that we've taken, we've had initial tests, 21 exceedances. 20 of the 21 have been clear, we have one that's pending clearance right now. Just to give you an example of the 20, I think 18 are lead and copper. We find this is not uncommon, unfortunately this is true throughout all infrastructure, but I certainly will take that.
That response is just spot on. That's exactly what people need to hear, not just that you did 100 samples but only 21 of them bad and 20 of them clear and here's what it was.
That's all embedded within the long-term monitoring plan. We have notification requirements to DOH and EPA. Those trigger once we hit EALs. If we hit an EAL then we make those notifications, but that's a point well taken and I need to do a better job outlining.
The priority is safe drinking water. Another hat that we have here at DLNR is ecosystem. Are you doing any monitoring for ecosystem?
The second piece of it is groundwater. I'll put that in the category of ecosystem. We are currently sampling at 35 wells two years ago. I know this is a two- year anniversary. 22 new wells were proposed and approved. Of the 22, 16 are complete, 3 are in progress now, and 3 more to follow both on and off Navy property. Furthermore, I have requested from BWS for them to provide consultation to us on locations that they think are best fit. We'll continue to have that dialogue. This is one thing I want to make sure you folks understand. I mentioned I'm not time constrained and I'm not money constrained, so if we need to do additional five wells or whatever the case may be then we'll do that. We will go where our data takes us and so I want to make sure that I communicate that to the community. I do have one thing I will ask the Commission, but I'll wait till I get to the end.
Besides just the monitoring, I'm interested in are you monitoring water quality in Pearl Harbor, in our streams, in nearshore waters? So that we've got some baseline data to make informed decision-making, we don't know what impact the leak has had on our aquifer as well as waters that may have gone out to Pearl Harbor or in our stream. Are you doing any monitoring in our streams or our ocean waters?
We are not monitoring the water quality conditions in Pearl Harbor. As we execute construction in and around the waterfront we're required to go through NEPA and that's a planning process that requires a variety of tasks, but that's not tied to this effort here. We're primarily focused on the Red Hill property and those that are adjacent to the property and then of course we test the water that comes out of the gaps because of the Hālawa Stream. That's the extent of it. Let me add one additional point. We just talked about water. Once our site assessment is complete, we use the word holistic a lot, I apologize but it will be a comprehensive holistic look including soil. There are areas we where we're most likely going to have to clean it up. Most likely we know we're going to have to clean it up and as I mentioned before we'll go where we find it.
I'm going to hold you to that because I'm also looking at impacts to marine resources. We have no idea. I'm looking at least trying to get baseline data, at least knowing what the conditions are today. What's the water quality? Has it changed over time? Is the impact of the fuel in our aquifer in some way leaking out to our nearshore waters, our streams? But without those monitoring devices in place, it's hard for me to tell.
I know that when this, maybe a year and a half ago or maybe even two years ago, when they were putting the water down the stream, Hālawa Stream, there were monitors out there and I don't know if it's continued.
It has continued.
Maybe you can talk about that. Is that what you're getting at?
But when you said, for me money is not an issue, oh I just jumped on that one.
I've been given specific, direct orders that we need to execute what I'm briefing you on and so I don't start with how much does it cost, I start with how can we make it happen? And what type of contract do I write and what is the engineering approach to it?
Okay, well I want you to put that into your equations during your site assessment also looking at ecosystems, marine ecosystems, fish, impacts to limu. I just need to ensure that I've got baseline data now so our staff can make informed decisions, our Division of Aquatic Resources, our Forestry Management because we don't have the resources to put monitoring devices into the ocean or the streams. I guess that would be helpful.
Since you said this is the first time we're seeing, I didn't quite get the name of your division or organization. You said US Pacific Fleets...
It's a long title. NAFACPAC. COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: NAFACPAC.
Everything across, well I'm responsible for everything else.
This is great because I think a lot of the questions that we get on the Commission really relate to what is in your purview. You also mentioned there is an upcoming meeting and is that an open, you were talking about BREC closure, cleanup and then something coming in the next...
I want to be careful because I use the word BREC, this is not a BREC action.
Sorry what does BREC stand for?
Base realignment enclosure. That's not what this is. What I'm sharing with you is that we have professionals that work in that program that understand complex environmental remediation cleanup activities. I'm bringing those experts here. It's an internal meeting essentially to brainstorm an approach to this facility given that it is not a closure activity with respect to the law, but it's how are we going to approach this. We need those types of people to advise us.
That's great. That helps give me some confidence that the Navy has the capacity to address what we're being asked a lot. I would just ask as that those plans develop if that can be communicated and there be some way to have some dialogue on like, hey does this work for the things you are concerned about with the Commission, with DOH? Because we're interested in the aquifer. I do have a question. You mentioned that the Navy is working on four items and you spoke mostly about the last three. Item one, remove for immediate contamination. That is what's on the agenda in the coming weeks, is that correct or is there something you can tell us now about it?
There are two parts of that so the next slide I'm going to walk through all the activities that we have in progress and that gets to the question that I think was asked earlier about the skimmers and then I'll come back to the discussion. Think of it really as near term, in progress right now, and then the future and the future meaning what does environmental remediation at Red Hill look like as we work through the closure process. What I mentioned just a few minutes ago was me pulling professionals here to Hawaiʻi to talk about once we get our site assessment, what's the next step? Everything that I'm describing there's a key few, I'm going to digress for a second. There's a couple things that Admiral Wade didn't talk about this but I will. As we look at JTF sunsetting and Navy Closure Task Force coming on board, I will tell you there are two things from an engineering perspective that have been outstanding. One is the establishment of the engineering controls during work that's going to continue. That will not change and that will fall under Admiral Barnett's purview but as the engineer in the background supporting them, we are going to ensure that that happens. The other thing probably most importantly is the integrated master schedule we call the playbook. That is an important piece but it's not possible right now for us to have a 100% playbook developed because we don't know what we don't know yet. This will be a living document that we will build as we go and then it'll be available for public consumption and at future meetings like this, so we'll continue to do that.
Question on the site assessment, my understanding is that the University of Hawaiʻi and USGS have been working on another study that was related to the geology of the region and are these done in parallel or are they working together?
I think you read my mind. Let's talk about that so that's groundwater modeling. There are two groundwater modeling efforts in progress today, there's one that was actually initiated before the Red Hill release in November of 2021. That's being accomplished by a company called AE Comp. They provided what they call the best available model in June of 2023. I directed them to because I said I'm tired of talking about it, I want your best model available but send it back to Department of Health and EPA and get their feedback which we've received. That model is not approved. They've done a lot of work, there's a lot of science behind it. They are on schedule to provide us for resubmission the next best available model next summer. That's one effort. The second one that I think you're referencing ma'am is from University of Hawaii, is a completely separate effort. It's independent, I have no control over it. This is an Office of Naval Research funded, it's a grant to the University of Hawaii that includes an engineering services contract. They're completely independent from the Navy and they're working the modeling effort. I can't speak to all the details right now, but I can commit in the future to talk to the specifics about both of those models and outline the hydrogeology and geophysics and all that behind it. But the purpose of that and coming back to Chair Chang, to your question about Pearl Harbor is better understanding the flow of the groundwater underneath the Red Hill complex. It is complicated, it's heterogeneous information. We all know living on islands, we live on volcanic rock, it's not heterogeneous. What does that mean to the person who's not technical? It means there could be multiple pathways for anything to flow anywhere, groundwater, whatever the case may be. Those two studies will better inform cleanup efforts. I asked for an update on their schedule, I think we're probably going to be a year and a half to two years out before we get those studies back. I think that's okay because it helps us better understand, make informed decisions regarding cleanup actions and get after these things in the best way possible. I only talked about long term so let me come back to short term.
Thinking about the treatment at Red Hill Shaft and trying to reduce the volume of water being pumped, it seems like it would be useful to use the groundwater monitoring data that has been collected at regular intervals to understand the nature of whether that is working. Have you done that analysis?
We sample the groundwater wells and our data we collect it to help us better characterize it. If we see any type migration then that's a trigger. It requires regulatory agency notification but the groundwater wells are part of that overall system of systems if you will.
I know that the data is being collected, but will we get a chance to kind of see it or have you done an analysis and interpretation of it maybe with DOH to understand the effectiveness of that capture zone? I guess I've heard criticism because of the nature of the Maui style shaft that actually doesn't create a very strong gradient. Is the data we're collecting going to be sufficient to allow for that determination to be made and is that with the Department?
I can address this one, ma'am. The subject matter experts that are working for both the Navy, the Department of Health, the EPA, CWRM has folks that are involved, the USGS. Our subject matter experts have got together many times on this topic and we have pulled together all the analytics of what we believe is happening. We've had those discussions, we had submitted it to the DOH and the EPA. There is still a little bit of a disagreement at the SME level and on the 15th of November, Dr. Ho and the DOH responded back with a letter that really is a path forward for how we can still resume or still proceed with a reduced flow at the completion of defueling as we continue to get our SMEs together to really come to an agreement. So, yes there are reports that we've submitted. They've been reviewed, there have been many, many meetings on this to try to work through those differences of opinions as the models continue to develop that will continue to inform it. Every day every piece of new information we get gets brought to that SME level, but where we sit right now today is on the 15th of November we do appreciate the letter that we just got from DOH that lays out a path that allows...we have to respond with the additional sampling that would be required as we move towards that reduced pumping.
Aurora, what we didn't want to do is to reduce the flow while there was defueling in the event there was something. We kept it at that rate and then we are moving forward, after defueling we're going to be able to see whether we can reduce it.
That helps to understand the logic. A simpler question, is there still fuel coming into the shaft?
Right now, skimming operations are running 24/7. We have a skimmer that is there as we're pulling, so we're to the point where we are getting less than a teaspoon a month that is coming, very small amounts as opposed to two years ago when it was several hundred gallons were abstracted by the divers and everybody that went. To answer your question yes, there still is small amounts that are coming in and that is proof as Admiral Killian talked about the capture zone, that any contamination that still may be coming is being pulled and collected by those skimmers on the surface of the water.
It seems like at this point we're spending a lot of energy and resources and water. If we can catch it earlier on then that would be a more efficient strategy but you guys, I assume have thought through all of this. I just wanted to ask a question for the sake of public transparency.
I appreciate the complexity of the task as reflected in the schedule and I also appreciate whoever gave us an 11x17 version of it so I don't have to pinch and expand. There's a lot of detail here and what I've heard in your responses to questions and the narrative you've offered are some really important points that don't jump out when you look at the schedule. I would encourage if not on this page which is pretty busy, another page says what does all this mean. What are the highlights of this and you've done that on the bottom of some of your prior slides because this is the punch line, this is what you take away from this. Give us the good news, give us the bad news as well. But tell us what's important in what's going on here. It'll just help.
You mentioned 35 wells, 22 of which were completed or operational, if I have that correctly. How many of those are suitable for sampling the surface of the aquifer, skimming?
They all go into the aquifer. When we pull, we put scuffers in and we pull them out, we pull the water out. We don't have skimmers in there, it's not a very big...
They're not catching the petroleum product that may be floating on the top of the aquifer? These are water production wells.
Monitoring wells.
Yeah, but you’re going to get the content of the aquifer, not the surface of the aquifer?
That's correct. We do it at different levels at different depths.
Where are the samples processed?
We have two different labs that process our data. The drinking water goes to a lab in Colorado and is processed, that's an EPA certified lab and then our groundwater samples are flown to Florida and sampled at the SGS lab there.
Turnaround time couple of weeks?
Turnaround time is about a week and a half. We get the unvalidated results and then it takes longer for the validation to run through.
Public accountability, I’m sure we’ll be responding.
We went through the website pretty quickly, but it looked really good from my standpoint. I wonder if you've had focus groups with key constituents to see if they're liking it, if it's impacting them the way you want it to?
It has and we continue to receive feedback and take that feedback to update it. We have very separate websites. We want to make sure the drinking water and the groundwater are separate because it's different standards, but each of the different outreach booths will walk through with people that are concerned, concerned citizens or just general public that have questions and we'll walk them through the website and take their feedback for how we can continue to improve it as it goes on. Still have some work to do but we're open to any additional suggestions.
Recently, there were 12 families that had indicated that there was some issue with their water. I think you guys went out to six of them, took samples. Are they reflected in your website?
The long-term monitoring, when we get those validated samples back yes, they would be included within this data, but we do reach directly back out to any concerned resident. We will give them a result, we will talk through the results with them, and walk them through any concerns. Once that data is validated and the LTM sample is completed, it would be added to this website along with everything. It's not going to call them out separately, it would be included in the LTM sampling that we receive.
I'm not sure if it's a NAVFAC question or where in the Navy it resides but at least wearing my UH hat I've heard concerns over water sort of on the back end of the water heaters. Whose responsibility are the heaters and trying to make the connection between the calls coming in and where we test? There's this sort of netherworld of the heater.
The water heaters, that has been a point of discussion over the last several weeks and we've been working very closely with the EPA and the DOH. We realize that we've tested the house, we know it is not fuel related, there are no other contaminations that we've identified through all of the normal testing. We’ve been working with the DOH and the EPA on how do we test the water heaters? How do we look at all of the rest of the system? For some of the residents that have shown that concern recently, in fact today right now I think it is still going on we have a couple of those houses where we're doing several things. We're flushing it out, we're checking the temperatures of the water heater, looking for any biological type growth, we're inspecting all of the fixtures throughout the entire house, we are draining and taking samples from the water heater. We immediately took a water heater sample and did the rapid test which it doesn't follow the Offland. It's not an EPA approved process, but we conducted the rapid test and we are taking samples of those water heaters. That actually has started today going to several of those concerned residents to do further, we refer to it as premise plumbing, but really to try to identify. We know what it's not, but after identifying what could be the issue that is causing concern. That's in progress.
So, no results yet.
No results yet, but we'll continue to work with that.
There was a comment on your working relationship with the Board of Water Supply. Could you expand that a bit? He said you have a technical relationship that's getting better or did I misunderstand that?
I characterize our relationship with Board of Water Supply as positive. We meet quarterly with the staff over there. We have primarily technical discussions as both of us are purveyors of water. I think that's an accurate characterization. We discuss things such as potential placement of monitoring wells, what do they think. We certainly want to draw on their expertise as experts on water here in Oʻahu. It would be silly for us not to recognize that, so we correspond with them and meet with them in person.
SMEs as well not just...
Not just in my level but the engineers, the working level engineers do that.
You two are the biggest users on Oʻahu from that aquifer.
This is a question that’s been weighing on me for a long time. It's hypothetical and you needn’t answer if it's inappropriate. It’s always seemed to me that to ship samples with all the protections and everything else off to the mainland, wait two weeks for results was a long way around. At the Department of Water Supply on Maui we had a CLIA certified lab suitable only for the samples generated by the department on Maui with respect to its drinking water wells and sources and treatment plants and that sort of thing. It's only sized for that capacity but it's CLIA certified. It's got the mass spectrometers and the technicians and all that sort of thing. If a lab existed in Hawaii suitable for conducting all the sampling of your programs, would that make sense from your perspective?
We’d use them in heartbeat. I prefer not to have to ship them. 
Why do you think it hasn't been done already? 
I can't, I have no aversion if there...
Can I answer something on that because on the UH end, that's been a discussion over and over again because UH was like why don't we have it at UH? But part of it is the level of QAQC that's required and the personnel needed and economy of scale.
The Department of Health was given some money by the legislature to stand up a drinking water lab so we bought the equipment and now we have the proper CLIA certifications, EPA certifications. We're getting staffed up and are learning how to use the equipment.
If I can just add in, the role of UH was determined to assist in a non-regulatory fashion but leave the high-level meeting compliance matters to the much more resourced Department of Health.
I want to express my appreciation for the representation that we have here. The leadership being shown, we didn't always have representatives who had authority over the matters being discussed or the information that was pertinent to the discussion or were very responsive. It feels like we now do. That's a huge step forward in looking at the clarity of your mission to defuel, to close, and remediate. That mission aligns with our interest of protecting the public trust resource and it aligns with what we've heard from the public in testimony. It's not just words, you have a plan and I get it it's a living plan. Some things that you think are going to work out aren't and so we'll track it and we'll monitor the effectiveness of the plan you set forth. You’ve resourced that appropriately both in terms of human talent and in terms of monetary talent and if that's an issue, there should be discussion of it and you're executing. I like the schedules and I love that. A little bit more focus on variance reporting in terms of here's where we plan plus or minus, let's see the deltas and let's reforecast or adjust our track so we can be accountable to our duties as well as to the public. Thank you very much for your presentation.
Community organizer with HAPA and the Sierra Club of Hawaiʻi 20 Will the Navy present Shutdown Red Hill Coalition’s resolution in DC? Will the Navy relate to Washington that the community demands no reuse and that quantitative research with Nakupuna is grossly inadequate. How does the Navy Task Force Red Hill define decommission? I ask this because I truly believe the definition should be drafted with the Insight of the community
can you arrange for the long-term remediation plan to be connected to the Joint Task Force as long as possible? There will not be much progress with just the Navy involved Older Red Hill spills like the one at Kipapa Gulch should be included in remediation
Member of the Community Representation Initiative Disappointed in the public engagement What is being done for the families who report health symptoms that do not exceed the EALs? Will this be conveyed to DC to address the lack of policy?
Why is the analyte petroleum hydrocarbon or gasoline not on the list of analytes? The 2024 date for the site assessment is unacceptable
Member of the Community Representation Initiative How long will the flushing of over 2 million gallons a day last? Unsatisfied with the vague answers provided by the Navy
It seems like remediation is always slow although there are funds
Directly affected by the Red Hill contamination. Suggests the Commission make water conservation recommendations to the military community
One drop of fuel means the process is still incomplete No reuse of this facility. How many of the 7,279 samples that you took are rapid response samples?
Attorney with Earthjustice Reexamine allocation of water that the Navy is permitted to use for their necessary functions
Water is precious. Protect the cultural elements that are affected by wai
What are the destructive means used to get the sludge out? Where is the sludge going to go? What are the long-term programs for remediation like biochemicals?
I realize in listening to the testifiers that maybe a lot of their concerns are directed to NAVFAC, what falls in the wheelhouse of NAVFAC. Because it's a later agenda item, can you tell me about how the Navy monitors its water use because my understanding is that a large part of the system is not metered or used to not be metered. Is that correct or incorrect?
We meter it at the well.
At the well but on the customer side or in the distribution side, how do you monitor potential leaks?
There are some meters throughout the installation but definitely not at every facility or every location. It is a combination of the monitoring at the source as well as at various points throughout the distribution system, but it is not everywhere.
I'm sure you were all taking down all of the questions that were asked. I always say the truth is someplace in between, so we thank you again for coming to give us these quarterly updates. Greatly appreciated this, very informative. The next three months, are we going to see a transition? Admiral Barnett, you're going to be front and center?
You will still see me in March. As I said, the Secretary of Defense has added to my mission to ensure an effective transition and turnover. I've heard many of the concerns from the community on this transition and I'm committed to get it right.
You obviously made an impact on some of the members who were testifying as they thanked you. I know I can never squander that, people have put a certain kind of trust in us. I'm sure you're all walking away with hearing all of those comments.
