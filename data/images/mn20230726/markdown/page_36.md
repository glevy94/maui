GENERAL HASHIMOTO: So we do brief the community -- 

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Yeah. 

GENERAL HASHIMOTO: -- in each and every open house we go to. 

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Yeah. 

GENERAL HASHIMOTO: As a matter of fact, we just came up with a new flier that is -- I mentioned the mail survey going out at the end of this month; it's being targeted through zip codes throughout OÊ»ahu. 

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Okay. 

GENERAL HASHIMOTO: We have a flier for that. We go to neighbor boards maybe two or three a week -- two or three per week, and we're presenting this at the neighborhood boards. 

And as Kathy just mentioned that we have this initiative kicking off this Thursday with the CRI, which is the community relations team, which will be a small group, okay, of people that are interested in Red Hill, which they'll be talking about the progress towards Red Hill overall being environmental tank closure plan and beneficial nonfuel reuse, and maybe be meeting twice per quarter in addition to all of the other public meetings, our public outreach. So there's a lot of opportunities we've had where we do go out and speak to the public about where we are in the process and the next steps.
