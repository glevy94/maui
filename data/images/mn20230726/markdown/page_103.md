Then we did some scenarios looking backwards to see what would happen. When we compare these backwards scenarios—backward-looking scenarios—to the calibrated model, we can see how conditions that exist in 2001 to 2010 have impacted the groundwater resource. We also looked in the future and did some hypothetical scenarios with increased withdrawal and change in rainfall to see how these conditions might affect groundwater resources relative to the calibrated 2001 to 2010 conditions.

For the first one, let's look backwards. In this example, we're looking at the past. One of the scenarios that we did was just shut down all the wells that we had in the 2001-2010 simulation. This would be looking back, you know, to pretty much predevelopment conditions. For example, this is just Oahu's, and these colors show the change in groundwater levels, the intensity of change in groundwater levels. You can see that by shutting down all the wells, it caused—well, it caused water levels to—I'm sorry, I've got to go back. I'll rephrase that.

Looking at the no-withdrawal scenario and calibrated model, we can see how the 2001 to 2010 conditions impacted the past. Then we can see that the 2001 to 2010 conditions have caused groundwater levels, water levels, to decrease quite a bit in the dike-impounded groundwater areas.
