**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Thank you. You make a good point that presumably, we're doing this to make the process more efficient, but that really hasn't been explained and addressed in the report. For Ryan, perhaps, to respond. If something has to come to the Commission, what's the typical time frame for approval versus if we delegate this? How efficient would the system be? Can you help us understand the benefit as to what we gain from delegation?

**RYAN IMATA:** I can tell you that our statutory deadline for approval of permits is 90 days, regardless of whether it comes to the Commission or whether it's delegated approval to the Chair. The problem with bringing all applications to the Commission is we have to take the time to draft the submittal and prepare all of the documentation for wells that comply with the well standards. I think that that would increase our processing time and it has increased our processing time quite significantly. I'm going to add to and I don't know that this is necessarily pertaining to the delegation in and of itself, but groundwater regulation branch is severely understaffed at this point. For the amount of things that we are tasked with right now, which includes the newly designated Lahaina and potentially Wai‘anae designation, in addition to now having to bring all well permits to the Commission. It not only adds a time component to our ability to process, it takes away our ability to really focus our efforts on areas where I think that there are significant concerns and significant potential impacts to resources including traditional and customary practices. I'll identify two of them. One of them is in the north sector of O‘ahu where there are really a lot of concerns about these large residential units on agricultural land coming up. I think that's something that we need to focus our efforts on to bring to you guys so that decisions can be made in a more open and meaningful way. The other one is out in Kūkī‘o on the Big Island where we have a brackish lens that we do have concerns about the lens potentially becoming saltier. Those are areas that I want to focus our efforts on to make sure that we're providing the adequate protection. Every time I bring a Hawaiian Paradise Park well to you for approval that is like 0.005% of sustainable yield, takes away the ability for Groundwater Regulation Branch to focus on things that are more important. So there's not only the time commitment, there's also the ability for us to focus our efforts where I think that there are concerns.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Point taken. Thank you, Ryan.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** If I remember correctly this issue came up because Chair was concerned about an open-ended delegation and this is an attempt to restrict the delegation. What's happened in the past? I don't know of anything that's happened in the past that the old system of delegation was leading to some problems. All I hear now is people are concerned about because it's been brought out in the open that we want to sort of restrict the delegation. It seems backwards that here we are trying to restrict the delegation and people are concerned about how we're restricting the delegation where in the past it's been an open-ended delegation.
