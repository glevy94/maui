is far below what we would calculate as the midpoint of the transition zone. So that's data on our Halawa deep monitoring well.

Next, let's go to Waimalu. So Waimalu is located, I suppose, northwest of the Red Hill fuel tank storage facility. It does appear that the freshwater lens in Waimalu continues to thicken, indicating that it's probable that there's a long-term influx of fresh water from the Ko'olaus. 

And the second point is just -- it's something that we're kind of speculating, so it's by no means definitive, but the presence of this increasing thickness of fresh water makes us theorize that there may be a hydraulic buffer for the Halawa Shaft that the deflects releases migrating northwest across Halawa Valley from the storage facility. Again, that's a theory, so we can't define that yet, but as you'll see at the end of my presentation, data is being collected to understand what's happening with respect to the plume and -- and so you'll see that at the end. Okay? So that's Waimalu.

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Yeah, Ryan.  
MR. IMATA: Yeah.  
COMMISSIONER BUCK: So the theory, that theory, how would that affect contaminants that would come out of the Red Hill facility?  
MR. IMATA: Yeah. Thank you, Commissioner Buck. So I guess our theory is that if there is a high flux of water
