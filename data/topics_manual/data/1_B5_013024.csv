PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Deputy Director Dean Uyeno Staff stated the summary request which is to approve SCAP.6047.3. QUESTIONS / COMMENTS
I was just wondering project proponents, BWS, did you guys talk to John Reppun or Rick Towill or KEY Project? They’ve been very active here; this is where I grew up, so I know Waiheʻe Stream and I know that they like to be informed. I think this is probably advantageous, but did you consult with them by chance? MATTHEW MURAYAMA, HONOLULU BOARD OF WATER SUPPLY (HBWS): Sorry, can you repeat that?
Did you consult with either John Reppun, Rick Towill, or KEY Project? They’ve been very actively involved with BWS.
I don’t think so.
I would urge you to put a call out to them, ask Barry Usagawa to give them a call so they know what’s happening up there.
Okay, yeah.
I would just echo that. That was a section of the application I also honed in on was traditional and customer practices and I know that there’s kalo farming in the area. Similar to with my comments on B4 when construction is occurring that there be communication with the downstream users because they will probably observe changes to maybe quality or flow or would be aware of the activities.
Matthew, you got that too? There is a very active neighborhood board there, Kahaluʻu Neighborhood Board that just meets right down the street. My grandfather had a poi factory on Waiheʻe right down and so this stream ran through his yard.
Now you’re in Windward Mall, the poi factories. CHAIR CHANG: Well no, that was Waiāhole. My grandfather was Waiheʻe.
I bet you guys used to have debates as to whose poi was better.
There was never a debate, we always knew, it just depends on which side of the table you sitting on.
