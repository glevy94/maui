developed in this area is from -- from these tunnels.

Okay. One thing we could say about the Schofield Aquifer is that this change in future withdrawals has -- the model simulation does indicate that the fresh -- the groundwater flow from the Schofield Aquifer to adjacent freshwater lenses in the north and in the south is gonna be reduced. It also pulls more water, causes more water to flow in from the dike-impounded groundwater areas.

Okay. Now, looking at one more thing, and this is another future assessment, this was a change in rainfall. This was a climate change assessment. And for this, we used the statistical downscaling of RCP8.5 for the -- for midcentury. I think you all are familiar with that. But it's a pretty dry scenario. And this indicates that -- our model simulations indicate for the water levels that there will be some areas that will have large water level impacts, and in this case, it's Waena, the dry side of Oʻahu. It's -- it also has -- you can see some color in the impounded areas on -- of the Koʻolau and in the Schofield high-level aquifer.

This map shows the change in saltwater-freshwater boundary caused by the reduction in rainfall, and we can see that accompanying the change in water levels that we saw in the previous map is saltwater encroachment in the Waiʻanae area.

So to summarize, the primary consequences limiting
