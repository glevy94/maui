"(926.4, 933.02)"," Hawaii Water Plan Framework, which actually provides additional policy guidance that the",926.4,933.02
"(933.02, 937.3)", Hawaii Water Plan Preparers use to put together these water use and development plans and,933.02,937.3
"(937.3, 940.06)", other Hawaii Water Plan components.,937.3,940.06
"(940.06, 946.76)", So let's just talk really briefly about the Maui Island Water Use Development Plan. It was began in 2016.,940.06,946.76
"(946.76, 949.0)"," In the draft submitter, you'll see that 2012",946.76,949.0
"(949.0, 951.2)", was when the commission adopted,949.0,951.2
"(951.2, 952.86)", and updated project description.,951.2,952.86
"(952.86, 955.3)"," 2016, the project began.",952.86,955.3
"(955.3, 959.74)", Maui Department of Water Supply began this effort in-house.,955.3,959.74
"(959.74, 963.28)"," In 2018, they submitted the plan",959.74,963.28
"(963.28, 964.72)"," to their board of water supply,",963.28,964.72
"(964.72, 973.0)"," the Maui Board of Water Supply, and then the plan with comments was sent to the Maui County Council in 2019.",964.72,973.0
"(973.0, 985.28)"," And through their adoption process and through the ordinance setting process, they added the plan, they added an addendum, which included some updated information, as as uh conducted additional outreach to the community",973.0,985.28
"(985.28, 989.76)", and council member sinensi uh will probably mention some of that what he did and can talk more,985.28,989.76
"(989.76, 995.52)", uh to the additional outreach that was done as they conducted their uh adoption process at the,989.76,995.52
"(995.52, 1001.2)", county council and in 2022 the plan was adopted by ordinance uh by the council and then the plan was,995.52,1001.2
"(1001.2, 1012.28)", submitted to the commission us for adoption and we subsequently held a public hearing in September on the plan to receive comments on the document before bringing it to you folks for adoption.,1001.2,1012.28
"(1013.02, 1026.0)"," So just again, really quickly, eight kind of targeted stakeholder meetings,",1013.02,1026.0
"(1026.0, 1028.0)"," sort of policy board presentations,",1026.0,1028.0
"(1028.0, 1030.14)", hearings at the board of water supply,1028.0,1030.14
"(1030.14, 1032.4)", and county council committee meetings.,1030.14,1032.4
"(1032.4, 1035.56)"," And Eva can talk more about this,",1032.4,1035.56
"(1035.56, 1037.2)", if there are questions about their process,1035.56,1037.2
"(1037.2, 1039.5)", in preparing the plan on this.,1037.2,1039.5
"(1040.38, 1044.76)"," So the commission went ahead and after receiving documents,",1040.38,1044.76
"(1047.32, 1047.46)", held a public hearing on it.,1047.32,1047.46
"(1049.96, 1050.64)", And that was held in September at the Kihei Community Center.,1049.96,1050.64
"(1053.62, 1054.28)"," According to our sign-up, about 33 individuals attended.",1053.62,1054.28
"(1061.38, 1064.54)"," As a result, we received about 53 total number of testimonies written and oral at the hearing. And the majority of the testifiers opposed the plan.",1061.38,1064.54
"(1064.7, 1066.48)", So what I want to talk to you next is sort of the testifiers oppose the plan so what i want to talk,1064.7,1066.48
"(1066.48, 1072.08)", to you next is sort of the issues that were brought up uh by the public through our public,1066.48,1072.08
"(1072.08, 1077.76)", hearing process about this plan uh and why why it was a why they felt it shouldn't be adopted by the,1072.08,1077.76
"(1077.76, 1083.52)", commission so there are roughly 10 issues that are brought up and i'm kind of summarizing them here,1077.76,1083.52
"(1083.52, 1094.0)", and you can look into the testimony of for specific issues that are brought up and I'm kind of summarizing them here and you can look into the testimony for specific issues that are brought up with this sort of like the summary of the things that we heard right so one was that the plan was difficult to read.,1083.52,1094.0
"(1094.0, 1108.22)"," People felt they should, it should be prepared by planning consultant. A second is that the plan relied on old data, rather, it should be used and updated data should be used um to develop it um the testifiers",1094.0,1108.22
"(1108.22, 1112.24)", had questions about what's the impact of the community water authorities when we held this,1108.22,1112.24
"(1112.24, 1116.8)", public hearing it was prior to the general election and still this community water authority,1112.24,1116.8
"(1116.8, 1122.44)", uh measure that was on the ballot at Maui County did not uh wasn't approved yet but it has been,1116.8,1122.44
"(1122.44, 1126.64)", subsequently uh next there were questions about elements,1122.44,1126.64
"(1126.64, 1128.8)", of this Haiku Pa'i'a community plan,1126.64,1128.8
"(1128.8, 1131.24)", needed to be incorporated into the document.,1128.8,1131.24
"(1131.24, 1132.92)"," And then related to that,",1131.24,1132.92
"(1132.92, 1135.46)", there's no information about how this upcountry water meter,1132.92,1135.46
"(1135.46, 1137.12)", lists would be resolved.,1135.46,1137.12
"(1139.0, 1142.12)"," Again, related to Haiku is that it's identified",1139.0,1142.12
"(1142.12, 1144.38)"," as a major source of the water for the island's population,",1142.12,1144.38
"(1144.38, 1150.48)"," but little was known about the water, as little is known about the aquifer um testifiers also had issues with uh",1144.38,1150.48
"(1150.48, 1157.04)", how water should be used right no water should go to hotels and commercial uses and climate change,1150.48,1157.04
"(1157.04, 1162.32)", impacts weren't considered as well as water conservation targets were not aggressive enough,1157.04,1162.32
"(1162.32, 1166.48)", and as well as um finally how is the lahaina water,1162.32,1166.48
"(1166.48, 1170.56)", management area designation that the commission did going to impact the findings in the wires,1166.48,1170.56
"(1170.56, 1175.6)", in the development plan and before i go on i just want to say um uh give a big thank you to the,1170.56,1175.6
"(1175.6, 1179.28)", people who've spent the time to come out to the public hearing on an evening and give their,1175.6,1179.28
"(1179.28, 1191.44)"," testimony and write to us and really appreciated the issues that they raised today. And so next, I'm going to go through sort of our staff response and our analysis to each of these issues that are brought up.",1179.28,1191.44
"(1192.12, 1196.78)"," So the first one about, you know, the plan being difficult to read and should be prepared by a planning consultant.",1192.12,1196.78
"(1198.16, 1225.84)"," You know, this is a criticism, a fair criticism that all the Hawaii water plan components have, even us, as we prepare the document, I think part of it is when you prepare a document as complex as these water plans yourself, it's really something that's within your purview and expertise and you forget that any public document should be accessible to any level of reader right regardless of their background um and so the",1198.16,1225.84
"(1225.84, 1230.88)", commission we're guilty of this as well but really the the method of preparation for the water use,1225.84,1230.88
"(1230.88, 1236.4)", development plan is not something that's outlined as a requirement in the code or the rules or the,1230.88,1236.4
"(1236.4, 1242.08)", framework as well as it's it's a resource issue some counties might not have the full resources,1236.4,1242.08
"(1242.08, 1246.0)", to really engage a consultant for all the development.,1242.08,1246.0
"(1246.0, 1254.0)"," Another thing is, as the document went through its preparation and the Council took a look at it, there was additional information that got added.",1246.0,1254.0
"(1254.0, 1262.0)", And so you see in this executive summary is about average double what the other water use and development plans are are are are on average.,1254.0,1262.0
"(1262.0, 1265.6)", So it's like double the length of what you usually see in the executive summary.,1262.0,1265.6
"(1267.24, 1268.08)"," The next issue was, you know,",1267.24,1268.08
"(1268.08, 1269.68)"," I mentioned the old data, right?",1268.08,1269.68
"(1269.68, 1272.46)"," So plan has old data, it should be updated",1269.68,1272.46
"(1272.46, 1275.14)", based on current data and availability.,1272.46,1275.14
"(1275.14, 1277.3)"," And, you know, the response to this is",1275.14,1277.3
"(1277.3, 1278.64)"," if you look at the framework,",1277.3,1278.64
"(1278.64, 1280.2)", which is the guidance document,1278.64,1280.2
"(1280.2, 1283.58)"," for preparing these water use and development plans,",1280.2,1283.58
"(1283.58, 1289.78)"," it recommends what's called a living document approach. This is a term that's thrown around a lot. But really, the idea is the document",1283.58,1289.78
"(1289.78, 1294.22)"," is constantly evolving and being updated. Because as soon as you begin updating the plan, the data",1289.78,1294.22
"(1294.22, 1301.66)", is old. And that's why another thing is recommended is developing a range of projections of water use,1294.22,1301.66
"(1301.66, 1305.08)", and growth. A lot of it's based on population projections.,1301.66,1305.08
"(1305.08, 1306.48)"," Obviously we know in 2020,",1305.08,1306.48
"(1306.48, 1309.62)", there was a big thing that happened that water use,1306.48,1309.62
"(1309.62, 1312.08)", and population demographic changes happened,1309.62,1312.08
"(1312.08, 1314.68)", across the state and the world really.,1312.08,1314.68
"(1314.68, 1316.1)"," But that's why you have a range, right?",1314.68,1316.1
"(1316.1, 1320.26)"," And the plan comes up with sort of a most likely scenario,",1316.1,1320.26
"(1320.26, 1321.68)", but you still have a range in there.,1320.26,1321.68
"(1321.68, 1323.9)", So you can plan for those uncertainties.,1321.68,1323.9
"(1324.94, 1325.22)"," When the addenda was added to the document But you still have a range in there, so you can plan for those uncertainties.",1324.94,1325.22
"(1325.22, 1331.4)"," When the addenda was added to the document through the council review process, the new",1325.22,1331.4
"(1331.4, 1337.34)"," sustainable yield projections were put in, which the Commission, after when this plan",1331.4,1337.34
"(1337.34, 1343.26)"," was originally started in 2016, in 2019, the Commission adopted new sustainable yields.",1337.34,1343.26
"(1343.26, 1345.92)", And so those are incorporated into this update or,1343.26,1345.92
"(1345.92, 1352.48)", this agenda um as you know mahipono became came into existence in central maui so those plans are,1345.92,1352.48
"(1352.48, 1357.04)", put in there as well as updated information about our interim industry flow standards with which the,1352.48,1357.04
"(1357.04, 1364.4)", commission is working um really diligently to uh adopt throughout the state um but i i will say in,1357.04,1364.4
"(1364.4, 1366.56)", terms of this old data one of the things that we,1364.4,1366.56
"(1366.56, 1372.72)"," will work on with the preparers as well as the county, including the county, is to incorporate",1366.56,1372.72
"(1373.84, 1378.24)", these climate change studies that we're doing now with the U.S. Geological Survey that looks at,1373.84,1378.24
"(1378.24, 1386.12)", changes to our availability of groundwater based on mid-century and end of century climate change projections so,1378.24,1386.12
"(1386.12, 1390.86)", we will be working with the preparers to make sure that is incorporated the next thing is this,1386.12,1390.86
"(1390.86, 1395.3)", question about how are the community water authorities um should they be considered you,1390.86,1395.3
"(1395.3, 1400.28)", know what what impact are they going to have on the planning and the plan and you know this is,1395.3,1400.28
"(1400.28, 1405.04)", a new thing like I said in November was the election where this measure was adopted by the,1400.28,1405.04
"(1405.04, 1410.24)", county uh voters in the county and we as well do not know the full details of what the community,1405.04,1410.24
"(1410.24, 1415.76)", water authority is uh perhaps councilman cincinnati can can speak a little bit more to that um,1410.24,1415.76
"(1416.96, 1422.56)", but we want to make sure that there is the nexus to that is identified and the role of this entity,1416.96,1422.56
"(1422.56, 1428.64)", is identified in the next update probably in the you see development plan i think it's going to take a while for the county to set these water,1422.56,1428.64
"(1428.64, 1433.76)", authorities up and what their purview is and really understand uh and so the commission can,1428.64,1433.76
"(1433.76, 1438.8)", understand really how they best interact with us but they will be part of the next water use and,1433.76,1438.8
"(1438.8, 1444.48)", development update um next one is this question about these elements the haiku community plan,1438.8,1444.48
"(1444.48, 1445.34)"," put your community plan, Pa'ia community",1444.48,1445.34
"(1445.34, 1448.62)", plan were not incorporated in the need to be.,1445.34,1448.62
"(1448.62, 1453.9)", If you look at the strategies in section 15 and 16 policies from the 1995 plan were incorporated,1448.62,1453.9
"(1453.9, 1455.08)", in there.,1453.9,1455.08
"(1455.08, 1460.28)"," One of the big things is that no groundwater, this is stated in the plan, that no groundwater",1455.08,1460.28
"(1460.28, 1465.6)", would be transported out of the region before adequate water is ensured for planned growth in,1460.28,1465.6
"(1465.6, 1473.36)"," the Haiku Pa'ia community. And so you see that in there. However, if you look at this 1995 was when",1465.6,1473.36
"(1473.36, 1478.24)", the plan was adopted. So we'd be interested to see if there's an effort ongoing at the county to,1473.36,1478.24
"(1478.24, 1485.0)"," update this community plan from 1995, right, with more new information.",1478.24,1485.0
"(1486.28, 1489.02)", Next one is like about the upcountry water meter list.,1486.28,1489.02
"(1489.02, 1492.92)"," And section 15 in the plan proposes some alternative options,",1489.02,1492.92

"(1508.0, 1510.34)"," This is related to the next three issues as well,",1508.0,1510.34

"(1525.64, 1529.96)"," So staff will be working with the water department on that as well as you know, this is related",1525.64,1529.96

"(1665.84, 1671.92)", sort of the portable portable aquifer needs so that's something staff is currently working on,1665.84,1671.92

"(1736.4, 1739.58)", That was really outlined to us as a guiding value.,1736.4,1739.58

"(1744.68, 1746.64)", So learning from the past and those,1744.68,1746.64
"(1746.64, 1752.16)", observations to create a better future. Water conservations are not aggressive. Targets are,1746.64,1752.16
"(1752.16, 1757.04)", not aggressive enough. In the plan they talk about per capita water conservation targets.,1752.16,1757.04
"(1758.48, 1767.0)"," Again, it's not something targets are not required by the code or the framework or the rules we ask that water conservation be looked at as a strategy really.",1758.48,1767.0
"(1768.0, 1791.36)"," Instead of developing new source, can you get some savings in water conservation so you don't have the county to look at sort of the plan talks about what we call per capita demand, which is really water and use demand, right?",1768.0,1791.36
"(1791.36, 1797.94)"," So people, you know, brushing their teeth in shorter periods, taking shorter showers, using, you know, changing their water fixtures.",1791.36,1797.94
"(1798.06, 1831.68)"," These are all per capita water conservation demand strategies. But something that all the counties currently do is called a water system audit and that looks at the supply side conservation measures and these are things like, you know, can you fix leaks in your pipes, can you improve your delivery of the water into the system so that you're through our water audit so we are committed to working with the county to look at these supply side um efficiencies that could be had by improving their water system",1798.06,1831.68
"(1831.68, 1835.92)", based on their water audit recommendations we think there might be potentially about one or two,1831.68,1835.92

"(2564.8, 2571.36)"," It is a living document, much like the importance of Kauaiola. The work doesn't end today,",2564.8,2571.36
"(2572.16, 2577.28)", but I do mahalo everyone who has shared their mana'o to get to this point. Mahalo.,2572.16,2577.28
"(2577.28, 2586.88)"," Oh, mahalo to you, Councilmember Sinansi. Clearly, there's been a lot of comprehensive outreach done on this and i",2577.28,2586.88
"(2586.88, 2594.24)", appreciate the overview that you presented to the commission um do we have i i know there's um,2586.88,2594.24
"(2594.24, 2608.88)", ifa blumenstein would you like to um to say anything if you with the water supply hello chair um commissioners yeah mahalo um yeah i really,2594.24,2608.88
"(2608.88, 2614.72)", just want to follow council members and nc and the community and the commission staff that has,2608.88,2614.72
"(2615.28, 2625.46)", spent so much time uh working diligently with the department uh private water purveyors and all a lot of work went into this plan.,2615.28,2625.46
"(2629.22, 2630.32)", We had an original plan submitted in 2010,2629.22,2630.32
"(2632.42, 2635.76)", to the commission that was rejected. It was not really adequately addressing,2632.42,2635.76
"(2635.76, 2637.14)", all the private purveyors.,2635.76,2637.14
"(2637.14, 2639.06)", It wasn't based on hydrologic units.,2637.14,2639.06
"(2639.06, 2643.78)"," And we feel that the plan really now does,",2639.06,2643.78
"(2643.78, 2650.0)"," I mean, it's addressing these controversial issues that have been unresolved for 30 plus years.",2643.78,2650.0
"(2650.0, 2654.0)", It doesn't come up with solution everything that it really tackles it.,2650.0,2654.0
"(2654.0, 2668.0)"," We knew, you know, starting the re reigniting the public outreach doing this effort back in 2,016 that there would be-offs and some difficult compromises so after 70 plus",2654.0,2668.0
"(2668.0, 2674.4)", meetings you know we feel that the plan now meets the uh needs of the land use plans it has,2668.0,2674.4
"(2674.4, 2678.72)", support from the broader community you know it's not going to be everything to everyone,2674.4,2678.72
"(2680.08, 2690.0)", but it's a good tool we've been able to use it already on a county level to guide our capital improvement program and investing in what a resource protection.,2680.08,2690.0
"(2690.0, 2698.0)"," So regardless, you know, for the commission's purposes, we believe it meets the State water code and and beyond even the framework.",2690.0,2698.0
"(2698.0, 2706.18)"," But so far we are grateful for the work that went into this, and that we've been able to to apply this as a guide for on",2698.0,2706.18
"(2706.18, 2713.86)", the county level so Mahalo for taking it up today thank you very much for that Saman and acknowledging,2706.18,2713.86
"(2713.86, 2719.86)", the good work of the community engagement you know I will want to reiterate this is not a this is just,2713.86,2719.86
"(2719.86, 2727.98)", an informational briefing but like the effort that's been done and described the water commission we,2719.86,2727.98
"(2727.98, 2735.0)", are wanting to create platforms through our commission for good information and the public to,2727.98,2735.0
"(2735.0, 2747.44)", to get informed as well as to participate so again thank you for all of the good work that's been done uh do i have anybody else i have i think i have gina lammer,2735.0,2747.44
"(2747.44, 2752.56)", who's um with the council did you want to say anything,2747.44,2752.56
"(2755.6, 2765.0)", sure i don't see her oh we don't all right thank you we're good so um commissioners do you have any questions of the presentation?,2755.6,2765.0
"(2767.28, 2769.96)"," Okay, I've got Mike Buck is raising his hand",2767.28,2769.96
"(2769.96, 2774.84)", and then I have Commissioner Kagawa Viviani next.,2769.96,2774.84
"(2774.84, 2776.62)"," Jeremy, this is maybe for you,",2774.84,2776.62
"(2776.62, 2778.62)", but any of the testifiers can jump in.,2776.62,2778.62
"(2778.62, 2781.18)"," Again, thank you all for the hard work you did.",2778.62,2781.18
"(2781.18, 2783.24)", How does the plan address that the majority,2781.18,2783.24
"(2783.24, 2786.48)", of the water delivery system on maui,2783.24,2786.48
"(2786.48, 2793.36)", is controlled by private entities uh as well the diversions in the water delivery system how does,2786.48,2793.36
"(2793.36, 2800.4)", this plan address that that issue um you know i'll let i'll let eva kind of mention talk a little bit,2793.36,2800.4
"(2800.4, 2808.24)", more about that eva did you want to touch on it sure um i mean this is thank you for that,2800.4,2808.24
"(2808.24, 2813.04)", question uh commissioner buck and uh it's definitely one of the main challenges specifically,2808.24,2813.04
"(2813.04, 2817.68)", for maui because we have uh multiple private purveyors that are sometimes competing for the,2813.04,2817.68
"(2817.68, 2826.56)", same resource and whatnot and we had to be really diligent developing this plan to make sure this is this is not the department's plan this is,2817.68,2826.56
"(2826.56, 2832.4)", not our cip program but it's looking at all the needs of other purveyors um and there's only so,2826.56,2832.4
"(2832.4, 2839.76)", many tools that can be used to implement strategies that are um that address the private water,2832.4,2839.76
"(2839.76, 2845.0)", purveyors because obviously the county doesn't have jurisdiction of allocations to that extent.,2839.76,2845.0
"(2845.0, 2851.0)"," So some of the strategies, I can just give you a couple of examples.",2845.0,2851.0
"(2851.0, 2868.58)"," There's calls for more investment in water resource protection, investing in watershed management based on the type of end uses if you are a private purveyor using groundwater from a specific",2851.0,2868.58
"(2868.58, 2875.5)", watershed you know we should see better investments matching investment for the water resource,2868.58,2875.5
"(2875.5, 2886.0)", that you extract if there are strategies for optimizing alternative resources before using conventional groundwater surface water in an area.,2875.5,2886.0
"(2886.96, 2889.2)", We want the planning department and the,2886.96,2889.2
"(2891.44, 2898.08)", bodies that will improve land use entitlements to include that strategy as a condition of,2891.44,2898.08
"(2898.64, 2903.44)", entitling a land use or approving a land use permit. So we've been working closely with the,2898.64,2903.44
"(2903.44, 2906.48)", Maui County Planning Department to set that up.,2903.44,2906.48
"(2908.42, 2910.14)"," So in areas that are not designated,",2908.42,2910.14
"(2910.14, 2911.28)"," there's all these different tools,",2910.14,2911.28
"(2911.28, 2913.76)"," but it's always a challenge,",2911.28,2913.76
"(2913.76, 2916.22)"," whether that is for conservation,",2913.76,2916.22
"(2916.22, 2918.42)", the large municipalities are better equipped,2916.22,2918.42
"(2918.42, 2922.36)", to have well-funded conservation programs,2918.42,2922.36
"(2922.36, 2924.62)"," or source protection programs,",2922.36,2924.62
"(2924.62, 2939.12)", and private purveyors benefit from that but other strategies such as regulating conservation measures in the future we're proposing conservation bill could apply to all water purveyors doesn't just have to be for county-owned system,2924.62,2939.12
"(2940.64, 2941.92)", that's just a couple of examples,2940.64,2941.92
"(2944.24, 2946.0)", thank you um doctor i have next up dr uh kagala viviani Just just a couple of examples. Thank you.,2944.24,2946.0
"(2946.0, 2949.0)"," Doctor, I have next step. Dr.",2946.0,2949.0
"(2949.0, 2986.72)"," Kagawa Viviani. Thanks, Jeremy,360 page document that didn't have applicable contents. because Maui is at this inflection point and as you emphasize community engagement is key you know",2949.0,2986.72
"(2986.72, 2994.24)", the document itself doesn't invite participation it doesn't invite access and you know parts of,2986.72,2994.24
"(2994.24, 3000.56)", the document maybe were overlooked because they were hard to find are there or can you develop,2994.24,3000.56
"(3000.56, 3006.32)", a more accessible format of this document without having to go through all the,3000.56,3006.32
"(3008.72, 3015.04)", consular approval you know just to make it more accessible and to allow for people to focus on,3008.72,3015.04
"(3015.04, 3020.96)", the sections of the document that relate to them or search it because even the ipcc you know,3015.04,3020.96
"(3020.96, 3027.04)"," intergovernmental panel on climate change report which is a totally unwieldy beast you know, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which is a totally unwieldy beast,",3020.96,3027.04
"(3027.04, 3036.48)"," you know, has broken things down in a way to make it more accessible to. And so is that possible?",3027.04,3036.48
"(3036.48, 3042.8)"," Like, I can see some easy things, but I don't know if that's for Jeremy or for",3036.48,3042.8
"(3044.0, 3053.0)"," people or Council Members from NC, but is there a way to sort of keep the content there, but make it more accessible without having to go through",3044.0,3053.0
"(3053.0, 3070.2)"," Council processes. Yeah, i'll just mention from the commission side totally agree with you on making all these documents much more accessible. I think that's a big issue too in terms of transparency, you know, making things more accessible for everyone to read is really goes a long way towards",3053.0,3070.2
"(3070.2, 3074.04)"," transparency in terms of government. So the commission, we're committed to working with",3070.2,3074.04
"(3074.04, 3078.78)", the department on creating a summary document that would be easy for people to look at.,3074.04,3078.78
"(3078.78, 3083.82)"," But yeah, so I'll leave it to Eva. Like I'm not sure in terms of time and resources,",3078.78,3083.82
"(3083.82, 3085.12)", they're willing,3083.82,3085.12
"(3085.12, 3091.68)", to expand on it but we're we're happy to work on that with the county eva did you want to respond,3085.12,3091.68
"(3094.96, 3101.68)", thank you um thank you commissioner um yeah i mean this is something we heard uh throughout the,3094.96,3101.68
"(3102.4, 3107.72)", um actually not until the plan went out for board the draft,3102.4,3107.72
"(3107.72, 3113.32)", plan that was submitted to the board and went out to board hearings and you know as the,3107.72,3113.32
"(3113.32, 3119.38)", plan went through county council it grew and it grew so you know even it started as a fairly,3113.32,3119.38
"(3119.38, 3127.04)", large quantity and it grew another couple hundred pages so it's an unwieldy document and the original format um,3119.38,3127.04
"(3127.04, 3133.84)", was never set up for uh easy access for for the public so at this point in time when it's been,3127.04,3133.84
"(3133.84, 3140.16)", passed as courtments um i agree with jeremy maybe we would like to have uh something that's more,3133.84,3140.16
"(3140.72, 3150.72)", a brief summary for general consumption and that document can be more quickly updated.,3140.72,3150.72
"(3150.72, 3157.12)"," We have, there is in the plan a matrix showing sort of an implementation matrix of what kind",3150.72,3157.12
"(3157.12, 3162.2)", of quantitative and qualitative criteria we should look at over the implementation of,3157.12,3162.2
"(3162.2, 3168.28)"," this plan because obviously there's all these different strategies that will translate into projects to be scoped out,",3162.2,3168.28
"(3168.28, 3171.9)"," where there's more opportunities for community input,",3168.28,3171.9
"(3171.9, 3175.0)"," whatever that is, you know, environmental assessments,",3171.9,3175.0
"(3175.0, 3178.8)"," well construction permits, conservation bills, et cetera.",3175.0,3178.8
"(3178.8, 3182.96)", So that sort of like a smaller user-friendly,3178.8,3182.96
"(3184.58, 3195.0)"," public use document we would like to have that would just be quicker update because we know there's not realistic update and what is wrong in five years, nobody has done that right.",3184.58,3195.0
"(3195.0, 3205.68)"," So, as long as this is the format of the framework. say water code i mean it's going to take this long you're going to have some outdated information in",3195.0,3205.68
"(3205.68, 3212.32)", the plan but we would definitely like to have a brief summary document to have for more immediate,3205.68,3212.32
"(3212.32, 3217.76)", use for the public i wanted to clarify i don't think a summary document would be great but even,3212.32,3217.76
"(3217.76, 3223.28)", just the table of contents isn't like hyperlinked to sections so you have to scroll down like,3217.76,3223.28
"(3224.08, 3225.84)", i mean that that doesn't require even any,3224.08,3225.84
"(3225.84, 3230.8)", subs that I mean I could have an undergrad kind of do that in for the day so like is that something,3225.84,3230.8
"(3230.8, 3238.4)", that could be done expediently and um and just as a step and then I guess as a follow-up like for the,3230.8,3238.4
"(3238.4, 3259.0)"," um update um is is the idea that this is a living document that there will be version B, or 2 point 0 in 5 years, because people are going to refer to right we're going to refer to the plan so if it's a moving a moving piece like",3238.4,3259.0
"(3259.0, 3265.28)"," when does, how are you going to control versioning yes that's what i mentioned the implementation matrix",3259.0,3265.28
"(3265.28, 3270.72)", similar to the community and the land use plans uh you know you don't update the community plan,3265.28,3270.72
"(3270.72, 3276.0)", version abc until you actually update the whole plan the policies are intended to be long term,3270.72,3276.0
"(3276.56, 3287.52)", um and as you know what what it use demand changes more quickly than that so the implementation matrix will be the tool to follow um lead agencies,3276.56,3287.52
"(3287.52, 3293.68)", funding other projects and whatnot um but but that could also have more of a summary that's easier,3287.52,3293.68
"(3294.72, 3299.92)", used and applied by the public that would follow uh maybe be attached to capital improvement,3294.72,3299.92
"(3299.92, 3305.04)", program uh proposals or you know whatever the projects that we're scoping out.,3299.92,3305.04
"(3308.24, 3312.24)"," All right, quick question. What page is the implementation matrix on?",3308.24,3312.24
"(3312.24, 3316.96)", I word searched and could not find anything matching implementation matrix.,3312.24,3316.96
"(3321.12, 3321.68)", Jeremy?,3321.12,3321.68
"(3328.0, 3332.0)"," Sorry, I'm checking. Eva, do you know off the top of your head? I'm looking in the index.",3328.0,3332.0
"(3332.0, 3339.0)"," Okay, this is a sign, this is a sign right here about it. So this speaks well to the point that was just made.",3332.0,3339.0
"(3339.0, 3347.44)"," Well taken, Jeremy. That's the um but yes excellent point",3339.0,3347.44
"(3353.76, 3355.12)", okay as as eva you're trying to find it um aurora do you have any other questions,3353.76,3355.12
"(3361.36, 3362.72)", okay thank you aurora do you have any other questions okay,3361.36,3362.72
"(3369.36, 3376.24)"," thank you very much do you have any other commissioners? Wayne Katayama? Yes, please go ahead. Thank you, Jeremy. Great presentation. Just to help me put things in context,",3369.36,3376.24
"(3377.6, 3390.2)", four other key elements providing input to the county plan are state plans. What is the currency or the,3377.6,3390.2
"(3390.2, 3397.26)"," how current are these plans? Like the water quality plan, the resource protection plan,",3390.2,3397.26
"(3397.26, 3412.9)", the AG water plan? Or does the county need to sort of update that on their own? Or how does the integration of that database work as a county goes through their water,3397.26,3412.9
"(3412.9, 3414.9)", development plan?,3412.9,3414.9
"(3414.9, 3418.46)"," Yeah, good question.",3414.9,3418.46
"(3418.46, 3420.1)", They're all sort of moving targets in a way.,3418.46,3420.1
"(3420.1, 3424.76)"," So I'll just say the Water Resource Protection Plan, which we've done, was updated last in",3420.1,3424.76
"(3424.76, 3425.82)", 2019.,3424.76,3425.82

"(3431.58, 3434.42)", which so water resource protection plan is the big one,3431.58,3434.42
"(3434.42, 3436.72)"," since it has the sustainable yield numbers, right?",3434.42,3436.72
"(3436.72, 3439.24)", That's what the counties need to use to plan for,3436.72,3439.24

"(3444.54, 3445.2)", The ag water use,3444.54,3445.2
"(3445.2, 3449.28)", development plan has been a difficult one in the sense that there's been several updates i think,3445.2,3449.28
"(3450.16, 3455.6)", uh i think you might have been here when the county their uh the department of ag did their,3450.16,3455.6
"(3455.6, 3460.08)", last update to us and there's a lot of pushback on this recent update to the plan so it's sort,3455.6,3460.08
"(3460.08, 3466.56)"," of in development right now and where we've sent them comments on how they can improve it,",3460.08,3466.56
"(3473.6, 3481.36)"," put more information in, but the latest version of that plan is really from 2012, I believe, so kind of old. So really the only number that's being used by the water plant preparers right now",3473.6,3481.36
"(3481.36, 3485.6)", is that estimation of diversified agriculture water use right so,3481.36,3485.6
"(3485.6, 3489.84)", there's 3 800 gallons per acre per day which is something that was in the last adopted,3485.6,3489.84
"(3489.84, 3494.32)", ag water use development plan that's what people are using to get an estimation of egg zone lands,3489.84,3494.32
"(3494.96, 3500.0)", you know um or ag entitlements what the water duty could be right for those places the state,3494.96,3500.0
"(3500.0, 3506.24)", water projects plan recently just completed the uh i believe in 2020 with the last statewide update,3500.0,3506.24
"(3506.8, 3513.84)", for all state projects across the state and then previous to that in 2019 i believe uh we had,3506.8,3513.84
"(3513.84, 3519.36)", the uh just for department of hawaiian homelands an update was done so those projections went into,3513.84,3519.36
"(3520.0, 3525.04)", the uh i believe they're used in in the different plans uh one of the big things that came out of,3520.0,3525.04
"(3525.04, 3530.16)", the state water projects plan update was we got an idea of what the uh reservations should be for,3525.04,3530.16
"(3530.16, 3534.32)", dhh on that's what we're using to set the reservations for the state good um so those,3530.16,3534.32
"(3534.32, 3538.64)", that's that's kind of the currency of it but as i said you know they're all sort of moving targets,3534.32,3538.64
"(3538.64, 3542.64)", the big one i think is the ag water use and development plan needs to be updated and we're,3538.64,3542.64
"(3542.64, 3545.12)", working with the department of ag um as you,3542.64,3545.12
"(3545.12, 3548.96)", know they have new leadership now so we're trying to work with that team to make sure that time,3545.12,3548.96
"(3548.96, 3556.0)", gets updated because we do see it as a critical component for water planning good thanks thank,3548.96,3556.0
"(3556.0, 3562.64)", you jeremy thank you thank you wayne oh neil go ahead unmute yourself thank you thank you chair,3556.0,3562.64
"(3562.64, 3565.04)", and thank you uh to the presenters uh jeremy on,3562.64,3565.04
"(3565.04, 3573.6)", this issue of ag water just clarify uh my memory if you will haven't we been using 2500 gallons per,3565.04,3573.6
"(3574.16, 3577.2)", acre per day in most of our agricultural allocations,3574.16,3577.2
"(3579.44, 3588.5)"," uh you know i i can't maybe kaleo can can speak to that, but the planning number that that has been adopted is is 38.",3579.44,3588.5
"(3589.72, 3594.24)"," But in many cases, some people might ask for less or I think like because that's kind of an old.",3589.72,3594.24
"(3595.22, 3609.86)"," number that was developed kind of a while ago, I believe, staff is using things like our irrigation estimation model to get a better idea of what demand is for the specific geographic area. I think that's resulted in lower per capita recommendations from staff,",3595.22,3609.86
"(3609.86, 3612.76)"," but Kaleo, I'm going to speak more to that.",3609.86,3612.76
"(3612.76, 3619.42)"," Yeah, the 2,500 gallon per acre per day comes from the wild-lived water case, and it's been",3612.76,3619.42
"(3619.42, 3626.96)", kind of what we've used as a conservative number. but in the Ag Water Use Development Plan it is closer to what Jeremy,3619.42,3626.96
"(3626.96, 3632.88)"," said. And then what we're also using is IW Reds, which is a tool we partnered with Lupono to develop",3626.96,3632.88
"(3634.48, 3641.92)"," to estimate actual site-specific agricultural irrigation demands based on type of irrigation,",3634.48,3641.92
"(3641.92, 3647.22)"," you know, evapotranspiration, all of that soil moisture is all factored into it.",3641.92,3647.22
"(3647.22, 3652.22)", So it gets us more down to the parcel specific estimates.,3647.22,3652.22
"(3652.9, 3654.58)", And all of those are presented to the commission,3652.9,3654.58
"(3654.58, 3655.48)", in its decision-making.,3654.58,3655.48
"(3655.48, 3659.02)", Ultimately the commission has kind of leaned more towards,3655.48,3659.02
"(3659.02, 3662.18)"," the conservative number of 2,500 gallons break up a day",3659.02,3662.18
"(3662.18, 3663.88)", in order to encourage conservation.,3662.18,3663.88
"(3663.88, 3665.52)"," So those, again, as Jeremy",3663.88,3665.52
"(3665.52, 3672.72)"," talked about, we're looking at ranges and not necessarily definitive points, right, for a number.",3665.52,3672.72
"(3672.72, 3680.24)"," And if it can be justified and through water reporting and data, we try to, you know, make it",3672.72,3680.24
"(3680.24, 3686.88)", as real and as possible. And when we encourage or induce or people have the wisdom to,3680.24,3686.88
"(3686.88, 3689.38)", invest in infrastructure that allow them to have water,3686.88,3689.38
"(3689.38, 3693.02)"," storage, are they then able to supplement and meet any gaps",3689.38,3693.02
"(3693.02, 3697.24)", that they have in irrigation need by way of our allocation of,3693.02,3697.24
"(3697.24, 3702.24)", 2500 plus a supplemental infusion of water coming from,3697.24,3702.24
"(3702.24, 3703.5)", their own storage systems?,3702.24,3703.5
"(3711.96, 3720.04)"," You know, that's a great strategy and something we'd love to like actually test and get proof on and data to support. But unfortunately, a lot of our agricultural users or even to systems in general aren't collecting that data, aren't doing that type of analysis.",3711.96,3720.04
"(3720.04, 3727.34)"," So we need to really push all water purveyors, whether it's not potable or non-potable,",3720.04,3727.34
"(3727.34, 3730.8)", to really start to look at how we can be better stewards,3727.34,3730.8
"(3730.8, 3733.22)", of those resources and collect the data.,3730.8,3733.22
"(3733.22, 3735.92)", Because I don't have a definitive answer for you,3733.22,3735.92
"(3735.92, 3738.98)", that that strategy is actually working,3735.92,3738.98
"(3738.98, 3741.88)", because we don't have reports on that.,3738.98,3741.88
"(3741.88, 3742.86)", Got it.,3741.88,3742.86
"(3742.86, 3744.96)", We look forward to that continuing discussion.,3742.86,3744.96
"(3744.96, 3745.92)", If I i second question,3744.96,3745.92
"(3745.92, 3753.12)", i have three items uh chair uh councilman uh is he available for you respond to question,3745.92,3753.12
"(3756.56, 3762.0)", yes go ahead councilman thank you for your report i really appreciated the way you responded to the,3756.56,3762.0
"(3762.0, 3765.24)"," questions and the issues that were raised by the public by saying,",3762.0,3765.24
"(3770.42, 3778.48)"," okay, if you say our data is old, or if you say there's gaps, here's what we did. Here's what we included. And I really appreciate that approach to it. And then invite, what did we miss? And it",3770.42,3778.48
"(3778.48, 3786.06)"," seems like as people said, you missed this, you then went and backfilled that information into your plan, which I think is an excellent",3778.48,3786.06
"(3786.06, 3795.4)", approach. My question for you is on the issue of incentivizing or inducing conservation.,3786.06,3795.4
"(3796.58, 3809.1)"," We live in an era of excesses, when people can actually afford to be excessive and are undaunted by a fine or a tiered rate",3796.58,3809.1
"(3809.1, 3818.62)", schedule to be excessive. So are you finding that that strategy of having higher rates really works,3809.1,3818.62
"(3818.62, 3830.08)", to induce conservation in certain quarters? Or might we have to put the very permit at risk or uh have the,3818.62,3830.08
"(3830.08, 3839.26)", power to re make our own reductions if they don't comply what's working yeah great question and I,3830.08,3839.26
"(3839.26, 3847.76)", think that the tiered structure was was one of the first uh efforts uh to address those very large users,3839.26,3847.76
"(3848.32, 3856.16)", uh some of them were some of the hotels that that still had those huge uh water uses during,3848.32,3856.16
"(3856.16, 3861.84)", during a pandemic when they were closed so i think that was the first step but but you're right part,3856.16,3861.84
"(3861.84, 3867.12)", of the strategies we had to kind of do it in in conjunction with,3861.84,3867.12
"(3867.12, 3874.88)", other things for instance you know uh the water director talked about expanding our r1 uses if,3867.12,3874.88
"(3874.88, 3882.32)", we are going to use so much water well you know we need to expand our r1 uses in those areas where,3874.88,3882.32
"(3882.88, 3885.0)", there's high water use so that we can you know we can use recycled water in some of those areas where there's high water use,3882.88,3885.0
"(3885.24, 3889.72)", so that we can use recycled water in some of those areas.,3885.24,3889.72
"(3889.72, 3892.94)"," So I think it's, yeah, the tiered work,",3889.72,3892.94
"(3892.94, 3896.82)", but also a pun intended multi-tiered approach,3892.94,3896.82
"(3896.82, 3899.3)", to doing other things in conjunction,3896.82,3899.3
"(3900.3, 3902.42)", with those conservation efforts.,3900.3,3902.42
"(3902.42, 3906.72)", I think the higher water taxes was just to kind of,3902.42,3906.72
"(3907.68, 3914.96)", deter and encourage um conservation but you're right i mean there's other there's other things,3907.68,3914.96
"(3914.96, 3927.2)", that we still need to also do some of the things were like if there's a lot of pool usage. Maybe we should be covering pools for evaporation,3914.96,3927.2
"(3929.32, 3934.04)", so that they're not being evaporated in the dry area.,3929.32,3934.04
"(3934.04, 3937.9)", So those are some part of the discussions that came out,3934.04,3937.9
"(3937.9, 3940.42)", throughout our two year process.,3937.9,3940.42
"(3940.42, 3941.44)"," I think throughout government,",3940.42,3941.44
"(3941.44, 3943.1)", we're looking at the issue of fines.,3941.44,3943.1
"(3943.1, 3946.56)"," And for some people, those fines just are meaningless.",3943.1,3946.56
"(3947.22, 3953.2)"," So if fines are meant to induce conformance and compliance, it doesn't work.",3947.22,3953.2
"(3953.2, 3960.2)"," Yeah. And the other, you know, it's normally a country that has the water restrictions.",3953.2,3960.2
"(3961.34, 3966.3)", So we're hoping to expand water use use whether it be through the East Maui,3961.34,3966.3
"(3966.3, 3974.58)", water Authority to increase water from from there um or you know other sources so that we're not,3966.3,3974.58
"(3974.58, 3981.42)", putting certain parts of the county on water restrictions while others uh enjoy you know more,3974.58,3981.42
"(3981.42, 3986.64)", water use right thank you very much uh for your response and your testimony today uh,3981.42,3986.64
"(3986.64, 3991.68)", chair the last question is for you i my zoom screen is showing that that perhaps uh lucienne,3986.64,3991.68
"(3991.68, 3996.48)", dene and keomoku kapu might be interested in testifying on this matter is that correct,3991.68,3996.48
"(3997.44, 4003.12)", yes i do have them in the waiting room so after we finish with the with the commission asking any,3997.44,4003.12
"(4003.12, 4005.12)", questions i'm going to take a little break,4003.12,4005.12
"(4005.68, 4012.0)", and then we'll take questions from the those in the chat so thank you thank you yes um,4005.68,4012.0
"(4012.72, 4015.6)", commissioner meyer did you want us did you have any questions,4012.72,4015.6
"(4018.24, 4037.0)"," thank you chair not at this time thank you very much commissionerato. Do you have any questions? Not at this time. Thank you, Chair. Thank you very much. And I guess I just want to confirm that this plan is really a framework right? It's to guide future decisions.",4018.24,4037.0
"(4037.0, 4052.66)", It in and of itself is not an authorization or decision Jeremy Eva Shane I'll agree okay all right thumbs up yes very good very,4037.0,4052.66
"(4052.66, 4061.9)", good and I do appreciate um the county's responsiveness to the questions and you and,4052.66,4061.9
"(4061.9, 4066.0)", Shane in particular Mahalo for your effort at community engagement.,4061.9,4066.0
"(4066.0, 4069.0)", That's really where I come from. I'm a kind of a process person.,4066.0,4069.0
"(4069.0, 4076.0)"," I leave I leave the experts here on the substance, but I am much more of a process person.",4069.0,4076.0
"(4076.0, 4086.62)"," You know it's important that people feel like they've been heard and listened to, and you apparently did a lot of that. You heard the concerns, you made appropriate adjustments,",4076.0,4086.62
"(4086.62, 4088.62)"," in particular, especially with respect",4086.62,4088.62
"(4088.62, 4090.7)", to Native Hawaiian rights and issues.,4088.62,4090.7

"(4094.2, 4096.78)"," not rushing to get the plan approved,",4094.2,4096.78

"(4101.54, 4103.86)", in ways that are meaningful to them,4101.54,4103.86
"(4103.86, 4106.9)", so that this document is much more reflective,4103.86,4106.9
"(4106.9, 4113.12)", of their concerns and approaches so again mahalo to the effort I have one more question,4106.9,4113.12
"(4113.12, 4120.18)", okay go ahead just a comment you know this commission is not a stranger to controversial,4113.12,4120.18
"(4120.18, 4127.54)"," issues on Maui with water and you know the comments, it sure would be great in April to have some sort",4120.18,4127.54

"(4130.8, 4133.08)", You guys have worked so hard on this.,4130.8,4133.08

"(4135.5, 4138.7)", that nobody can access is not really reflective,4135.5,4138.7
"(4138.7, 4139.84)", of the work that you put in.,4138.7,4139.84
"(4139.84, 4143.28)", So I'm really hoping in April that there is some sort,4139.84,4143.28
"(4143.28, 4145.28)", of executive summary to make it a little,4143.28,4145.28
"(4145.28, 4151.12)", more easy to read i think that would benefit all the future water issues on maui thank you,4145.28,4151.12
"(4151.12, 4157.68)", no thank you you might want to take um uh commissioner kagawa viviani's offer to have her,4151.12,4157.68
"(4157.68, 4174.0)"," student did you have a question aurora i did have one more follow up. All right, it's actually directed to our sort of ex officio doh representative, I guess, and and the presenters.",4157.68,4174.0
"(4174.0, 4187.12)", You know i'm thinking about wahoo and molly's trajectory of urbanization and our current water quality issues that i'm becoming more and more aware of. I'm teaching water and,4174.0,4187.12
"(4187.12, 4192.74)"," society this semester, get lots of questions from the students. We've covered recycled water and",4187.12,4192.74

"(4199.1, 4206.08)", worried should we be about these emerging organic contaminants pharmaceuticals that are in our wastewater streams,4199.1,4206.08
"(4206.08, 4212.72)", that could you know you know as well as nitrates um because it's not just about water amounts and,4206.08,4212.72
"(4212.72, 4218.8)", allocations but as we use more water to creating more wastewater to have to then spend energy,4212.72,4218.8
"(4218.8, 4230.0)", cleaning so if you have thoughts on on that and how to think about it in the cons context of the,4218.8,4230.0

"(6550.62, 6556.52)", proposed this session regarding traditional customary practices and,6550.62,6556.52
"(6556.52, 6562.36)", commercial use. It has been the position of the department in our testimony that,6556.52,6562.36
"(6562.36, 6569.78)"," under Article 12, Section seven, it it specifically says not for commercial use.",6562.36,6569.78
"(6569.78, 6572.72)", So we have taken the position that it is really,6569.78,6572.72
"(6572.72, 6575.48)", just for subsistence purposes.,6572.72,6575.48
"(6575.48, 6579.08)"," You can have a traditional practice,",6575.48,6579.08
"(6579.08, 6583.58)", but I think because it is so we understand,6579.08,6583.58
"(6583.58, 6587.28)", that it's an evolving issue.,6583.58,6587.28
"(6587.28, 6597.1)"," I think we're just not ready to make, at this point in time, take a position contrary to,",6587.28,6597.1
"(6597.1, 6599.64)"," I think, how we are interpreting the law.",6597.1,6599.64
"(6599.64, 6604.08)"," Now there may be some changes in case law, but I think at this point in time, we are",6599.64,6604.08
"(6604.08, 6605.68)", taking the position that traditional,6604.08,6605.68
"(6605.68, 6612.32)", customary practices do not include commercial use and we were successful in actually getting,6605.68,6612.32
"(6612.32, 6620.16)", proposed legislation to delete that so i think ongoing conversation clearly um you know if we,6612.32,6620.16
"(6620.16, 6626.08)", are supporting agricultural use we do have to kind of look at this but i think that that is a,6620.16,6626.08
"(6626.08, 6632.32)", that you know that's a question probably far beyond at this point in time unless there's a,6626.08,6632.32
"(6632.32, 6638.24)", change in the law i think we are kind of drawing maybe a little a thin line but i think one that,6632.32,6638.24
"(6638.24, 6646.48)", we're holding to that it has to be traditional customer practices for subsistence use now priorities for for purposes,6638.24,6646.48
"(6646.48, 6652.64)", of of issuance and public trust yes traditional customer practices may have a priority clearly,6646.48,6652.64
"(6652.64, 6657.68)", over commercial use so i think the rubber hits the road when we start doing things like that,6652.64,6657.68
"(6657.68, 6662.96)", but at this time that is the department's position it's a it's a complicated issue it sounds like we,6657.68,6662.96
"(6662.96, 6671.64)", have the right team in place to kind of uh plug into all the conversations about this issue but I mean subsistence back in back in,6662.96,6671.64
"(6671.64, 6678.0)", the day meant you traded you know Carlo for fish today you got to pay property taxes you got to,6671.64,6678.0
"(6678.0, 6687.76)", you know you got to pay uh for a cultural consultant uh to do to subsist so i i think uh good it's it's a difficult issue,6678.0,6687.76
"(6687.76, 6691.52)", and appreciate that uh consideration is being made to protect our interests but,6687.76,6691.52
"(6691.52, 6696.56)", not open the door to something we don't want to open to but also really define that term of what,6691.52,6696.56
"(6696.56, 6712.72)"," does commercial really mean uh i have a question for uh kawahana Guth. Now you can unmute. Hi. Aloha. So the Hayatera system is, well,",6696.56,6712.72
"(6712.78, 6718.3)"," first of all, do you perceive that the retention of an archaeological consultant, and I've hired",6712.78,6718.3

"(6957.88, 6966.6)", but got taken off because they decided they needed to look a little deeper into our application because of they suddenly became,6957.88,6966.6
"(6966.6, 6974.94)", aware of our association with the Haya Terraces and so I had let them know that I were very,6966.6,6974.94

"(6998.84, 7006.9)"," um, the, we had to, they let us know that Hi Chris was their new website and that we had to navigate that",6998.84,7006.9
"(7006.9, 7015.6)", now and so we did and so in November of 2021 we finally got that completed and in January they,7006.9,7015.6
"(7015.6, 7020.16)", said that they completed their review and that we needed a letter from the government agency who,7015.6,7020.16
"(7020.16, 7025.46)", requested the review and so we had let Sea Worm know and at the time we were told that they were,7020.16,7025.46
"(7025.46, 7031.8)", super busy but they would get to it and so we left it at that and that was January of 2021,7025.46,7031.8
"(7031.8, 7042.84)", and then in May of 2021 we got a letter from Kathy Yoda with a new form some type of a HRS6E,7031.8,7042.84
"(7042.84, 7047.9)", or something like that which was a new form that the State Historic Preservation,7042.84,7047.9
"(7047.9, 7053.26)", was putting out there for people to use. And they asked that we would use that. And I explained,7047.9,7053.26
"(7053.26, 7056.94)"," that we already went through the review and they said, well, they never got a determination",7053.26,7056.94

"(7065.36, 7072.16)", said oh no they actually forgot and so they sent it to me then so i had to upload it and send it,7065.36,7072.16
"(7072.16, 7077.44)", to shifty but i also sent in that new form and what it did was it generated a whole new review,7072.16,7077.44
"(7078.0, 7089.06)", so this was in june that now i got this next review submitted and we waited and waited and I kept calling and,7078.0,7089.06
"(7089.06, 7094.52)", checking on them because I was holding up our application and shifty finally in November last,7089.06,7094.52
"(7094.52, 7101.06)", November tells us that they cannot do a review of our property because it's an after the fact,7094.52,7101.06
"(7101.06, 7105.28)", and according to their books they can't do after the fact and that we've,7101.06,7105.28
"(7105.28, 7111.12)", already unearthed probably the area and they show in their pictures that we've had a stream,7105.28,7111.12
"(7111.12, 7116.72)", diversion on that side of the stream and water flowing through the higher terraces that is,7111.12,7116.72
"(7116.72, 7126.16)", totally totally false we have not we have six land commission awards two on one side of the stream and four on the other.,7116.72,7126.16
"(7126.96, 7132.96)", The two on one side of the stream are accessible for us to drive to do our work. During COVID it,7126.96,7132.96
"(7132.96, 7138.08)", was perfect because we have six grown kids and their families and everybody came and helped us,7132.96,7138.08
"(7138.08, 7146.34)", clear the land and plant kalo. It was actually a really special time for us. But we didn't do anything across the stream.,7138.08,7146.34
"(7146.62, 7151.88)"," We didn't do anything across the stream, which is where four more Land Commission Awards are.",7146.62,7151.88
"(7151.88, 7158.24)"," And the Haya Terrace, the Haya property is adjacent to ours on top of the hill.",7151.88,7158.24
"(7158.42, 7162.38)", We're down at the stream area and they are on top of the hill.,7158.42,7162.38
"(7162.64, 7166.56)", This is the land where Kohoma Stream and Kanaha Stream,7162.64,7166.56
"(7166.56, 7171.8)"," merge a little ways up from there. And it's like a, it goes up about 200 feet.",7166.56,7171.8
"(7172.38, 7181.34)", And that's where the Haya property is and the Haya terraces. And for them to say that we have,7172.38,7181.34
"(7181.34, 7185.04)"," a diversion, which we don't't and that they have water going through",7181.34,7185.04
"(7185.04, 7190.56)", the terraces is so unbelievable but there's nothing we can do about it because they never,7185.04,7190.56
"(7190.56, 7196.88)", came out to visit us we wanted them to do a site visit but they never did in fact i could barely,7190.56,7196.88
"(7196.88, 7205.94)", get a hold of them and since they sent this determination letter saying that they're going to recommend to sea worm that we get denied,7196.88,7205.94
"(7207.2, 7212.9)", after not even coming out and saying all these false things we're just I I wrote to Dean and,7207.2,7212.9
"(7212.9, 7218.84)", said I'm just flustered I don't know what to do and I appreciate Dean and his willing to try to,7212.9,7218.84
"(7218.84, 7224.66)", you know he came out there with Alexa and Aaron and they could see that we haven't done anything,7218.84,7224.66
"(7224.66, 7225.16)", over there.,7224.66,7225.16
"(7225.16, 7226.42)", It's still an international state.,7225.16,7226.42
"(7226.42, 7228.98)", There's no reason why SHPTI cannot come out there,7226.42,7228.98
"(7228.98, 7233.98)", and do a study to see if the terraces are being impacted,7228.98,7233.98
"(7234.82, 7239.82)", or will be impacted by any type of cultivation or planting.,7234.82,7239.82
"(7241.06, 7242.42)", There's nothing we've done over there,7241.06,7242.42
"(7242.42, 7245.62)", except built a bridge that goes from one bank to,7242.42,7245.62
"(7245.62, 7254.86)"," the other. That's all. And now they want us to do a consultant. And we did finally, we called",7245.62,7254.86

"(7262.52, 7269.52)", everything. And they gave us a proposal. And like Naomiami said it comes out to be you know after we pay for their car and airfare about twelve,7262.52,7269.52
"(7269.52, 7278.32)", thousand dollars which again made us lose sleep again and we're just all we want to do is grow,7269.52,7278.32

"(7626.24, 7628.54)"," and then conversations with the Gouttes, right,",7626.24,7628.54
"(7628.54, 7629.88)"," the burials are located at Malka,",7628.54,7629.88
"(7629.88, 7631.92)", so burials aren't gonna be impacted.,7629.88,7631.92
"(7631.92, 7633.88)"," But under historic preservation law, right,",7631.92,7633.88
"(7633.88, 7637.08)"," we have an obligation to protect archeological sites,",7633.88,7637.08
"(7637.08, 7638.78)", especially if they're registered.,7637.08,7638.78
"(7638.78, 7641.26)", And so I think that's the extent of the comments,7638.78,7641.26
"(7641.26, 7642.8)", that came from archeological branch.,7641.26,7642.8
"(7642.8, 7644.48)", So I think your recommendation,7642.8,7644.48
"(7644.48, 7649.2)", to have the culture and historic branch review this and and provide additional,7644.48,7649.2
"(7649.2, 7655.76)", recommendations this body would be helpful um i don't know if they did review the application most,7649.2,7655.76
"(7655.76, 7660.88)", of the permits are reviewed mostly from the archaeological branch so i think your recommendations,7655.76,7660.88
"(7660.88, 7666.16)", that include hinano would be a great recommendation moving forward and whether,7660.88,7666.16
"(7666.16, 7671.28)", or not they would deviate from still requiring our plan or not because it is usually standard,7666.16,7671.28
"(7671.28, 7679.12)", language that CHIPD requires right so we have to work through that even with lineal descendants,7671.28,7679.12
"(7679.12, 7683.84)", that have claims these are just larger Wahi Kupuna stewardship issues right that we have to deal with,7679.12,7683.84
"(7683.84, 7685.18)", throughout the state.,7683.84,7685.18
"(7685.18, 7688.1)", And there is a nexus here with the reestablishment,7685.18,7688.1
"(7688.1, 7691.04)", of Oya and traditional cultural sites,7688.1,7691.04
"(7692.62, 7694.14)", before the Water Commission.,7692.62,7694.14
"(7694.14, 7697.7)"," I'm probably gonna get scolded for saying this,",7694.14,7697.7
"(7697.7, 7702.14)", but sometimes we need to use common sense,7697.7,7702.14
"(7703.22, 7704.9)", and be practical.,7703.22,7704.9
"(7705.3, 7708.3)", But Hinano is from the area.,7705.3,7708.3
"(7708.3, 7714.52)"," I think we should give Hinano an opportunity to visit the Gouttes if he hasn't already,",7708.3,7714.52
"(7714.52, 7719.24)"," and provide us a better assessment based upon a site visit,",7714.52,7719.24

"(7726.4, 7734.8)"," He can perhaps, maybe as you say, doing a site visit will give him a better appreciation",7726.4,7734.8

"(7765.32, 7768.12)", I think he now takes into considerations,7765.32,7768.12

"(7769.94, 7774.94)"," I'm not in any way disregarding SHPD and the archeologists,",7769.94,7774.94

"(11135.64, 11139.02)"," some of the pipes were in place, but they weren't actually diverting,",11135.64,11139.02
"(11139.94, 11146.5)"," either because they had been broken or I'm not sure if they were clogged,",11139.94,11146.5
"(11146.64, 11153.14)", but there was no water in them at the time versus when we went this last time.,11146.64,11153.14
"(11153.14, 11157.06)"," I believe there were additional, and Aaron may be able to speak better to this,",11153.14,11157.06
"(11157.12, 11162.68)", but there were additional pipes in the stream different from the ones that we had seen prior,11157.12,11162.68
"(11162.68, 11167.2)", and pumps that were observed.,11162.68,11167.2
"(11168.1, 11171.2)", And those are all in the 888 parcel?,11168.1,11171.2
"(11172.58, 11176.76)"," So again, the 888 is just a small sliver of the stream itself.",11172.58,11176.76
"(11177.94, 11183.26)"," The pump that we observed was up on the bank,",11177.94,11183.26
"(11183.38, 11186.3)", so I'm not exactly sure which parcel that was on.,11183.38,11186.3
"(11186.66, 11191.46)"," But yeah, I guess some of those pipes may have been in that 888 parcel.",11186.66,11191.46
"(11193.72, 11197.38)", Are there any other diversion permits other than the boots?,11193.72,11197.38
"(11198.22, 11198.5)", No.,11198.22,11198.5
"(11198.5, 11201.32)", Or is it in process or have been approved?,11198.5,11201.32
"(11201.7, 11202.54)"," No, we have not.",11201.7,11202.54
"(11202.54, 11207.32)", We need to follow up on on these other um diverters,11202.54,11207.32
"(11207.32, 11215.76)", yeah it was it was kind of a messy situation initially because we didn't really understand,11207.32,11215.76
"(11215.76, 11221.68)", what was going on as far as these lca these individual lcas within this larger parcel,11215.76,11221.68
"(11221.68, 11225.46)", that was being sold off and how those how we would treat,11221.68,11225.46
"(11225.46, 11229.72)", those in that case because in the initial complaint always you know as when we looked,11225.46,11229.72
"(11229.72, 11234.82)", up ownership we we referred back to it I believe it was Kohoma land which is a subsidiary of West,11229.72,11234.82
"(11234.82, 11242.86)", Maui Land Company um and so you know we were talking with with the uh President Peter Martin,11234.82,11242.86
"(11242.86, 11245.36)"," at the time and and his response was,",11242.86,11245.36
"(11245.36, 11247.96)"," well, we sold off these LCA parcels,",11245.36,11247.96
"(11247.96, 11249.88)", so you need to talk to those people.,11247.96,11249.88
"(11251.66, 11254.84)"," So yeah, that's the situation we encountered early on.",11251.66,11254.84
"(11257.08, 11260.66)", So who could sort of provide a little more clarity,11257.08,11260.66
"(11260.66, 11264.7)", on the landowners listed as end users?,11260.66,11264.7
"(11264.7, 11267.2)", Kohoma Land Company is one of them.,11264.7,11267.2
"(11267.2, 11270.08)"," Yeah, we'd have to work with them to identify",11267.2,11270.08
"(11270.76, 11275.44)", the owners who that that had purchased through them.,11270.76,11275.44
"(11276.84, 11280.64)", And the AG is comfortable about allowing us to issue,11276.84,11280.64
"(11280.8, 11284.44)", diversion permits to,11280.8,11284.44
"(11284.44, 11291.52)", someone that has no legal access um we have we haven't been consulted,11284.44,11291.52
"(11291.52, 11299.44)", on that issue pardon i'm sorry cindy um we haven't been consulted on that issue if if the commission,11291.52,11299.44
"(11299.44, 11311.0)", requires advice we'd want to look into it further youtube If you can be still going so don't worry we have some technical issues in the in the room.,11299.44,11311.0
"(11311.0, 11314.0)", With,11311.0,11314.0
"(11314.0, 11326.36)"," Commissioner Katayama, the AG's office hasn't been consulted at this time. And if we'd like them to be consulted, we can we can do so it's just a matter of comfort and you know",11314.0,11326.36
"(11327.08, 11331.28)", are we providing the goods with any kind of comfort by issuing a permit,11327.08,11331.28
"(11333.74, 11340.64)", um I've got us yeah go ahead sure no I've got a question from Paul Meyer and I'm sorry I've,11333.74,11340.64
"(11340.64, 11345.4)", got a hard stop at 12 30. so we're going to go up until 1230. Go ahead.,11340.64,11345.4
"(11346.6, 11349.18)"," Thank you. Hi, Cindy, a question, quick question for",11346.6,11349.18
"(11349.18, 11354.62)"," you. You know, I'm not an attorney and and have you looked",11349.18,11354.62
"(11354.62, 11370.96)"," into the question of traditional and customary activities being the basis for commercial activity, as is the case here. And what is,",11354.62,11370.96
"(11371.06, 11376.18)", we've heard earlier today that the law currently does not provide for that.,11371.06,11376.18
"(11377.02, 11383.32)", And somebody needs to change the law if they want to do that. And it really comes to the,11377.02,11383.32
"(11383.32, 11387.08)", commission to try to deal with that circumstance what does the,11383.32,11387.08
"(11387.08, 11397.1)", law say right now can you clarify that unequivocally for us okay um me sorry I just need a a minute um,11387.08,11397.1
"(11397.1, 11407.8)", we haven't taken a deep dive into that though I mean to answer that I mean if that's your question.,11397.1,11407.8
"(11409.42, 11411.58)"," Chair, if I can, real quick. Just while Cindy is going through that,",11409.42,11411.58
"(11411.58, 11413.38)"," Commissioner Meyer, mahalo for the question.",11411.58,11413.38
"(11413.38, 11418.24)"," I think just for clarity, staff in our review,",11413.38,11418.24
"(11418.24, 11420.46)", anybody can apply for Extreme Diversion Works permit.,11418.24,11420.46
"(11420.46, 11422.36)", So that's what we're processing.,11420.46,11422.36
"(11422.36, 11426.56)", The analysis and recommendation related to tnc was,11422.36,11426.56
"(11426.56, 11431.92)", type the fine whether or not we actually find was tied to the fact that there's traditional,11426.56,11431.92
"(11431.92, 11436.24)", customary practice so i want to bifurcate the conversation student version works permits are,11431.92,11436.24
"(11436.24, 11441.6)", not only limited to tnc so just making that clear for the record right so anybody can apply for,11436.24,11441.6
"(11441.6, 11446.4)", stream diversion works permit but our intent to not fine is because,11441.6,11446.4
"(11446.4, 11452.72)", the pre the applicants participate in tnc as well as commercial but based on that that's why we,11446.4,11452.72
"(11452.72, 11458.64)", recommend it not finding so that's the context of the tnc i yeah i understand thanks very much,11452.72,11458.64
"(11458.64, 11468.72)", cleo um at the same time um what it what it seems is that we we're uh participating in a scheme to break the,11458.64,11468.72
"(11468.72, 11477.84)", law and um that whether a fine is issued or not uh the permit comes into question and question of,11468.72,11477.84
"(11477.84, 11482.56)", whether a cease and desist order or cease and desist letter is appropriate i'm not trying to,11477.84,11482.56
"(11482.56, 11485.04)", be a hard guy or anything i understand the valley out,11482.56,11485.04
"(11485.04, 11492.0)", there and understand it pretty well but um i i think we have a duty an irrevocable duty to follow,11485.04,11492.0
"(11492.0, 11498.72)", the state code and unless somebody can change the law i don't know are we in a bind here seems like,11492.0,11498.72
"(11498.72, 11509.58)"," maybe we are as i understand it i i think and I can, what, and I appreciate the clarification from",11498.72,11509.58
"(11509.58, 11517.58)"," Kaleo, is the traditional customary practices, the question about commercial, is only related",11509.58,11517.58
"(11517.58, 11521.4)", to whether we decide to waive the fine or not.,11517.58,11521.4
"(11521.4, 11529.0)"," And so that's separate from whether, because anybody's entitled to apply for stream diversion permit.",11521.4,11529.0
"(11529.0, 11546.72)"," So notwithstanding that the GOOTS may be doing commercial activity, I think it's own, the question of traditional customary practices is only related to whether we would waive the fine",11529.0,11546.72
"(11548.24, 11554.8)", yeah and i it's ultimately the discretion of this body right to decide whether to deny accept,11548.24,11554.8
"(11554.8, 11561.44)", modify a cast condition this is your discretion um and i think you are acting within the context,11554.8,11561.44
"(11561.44, 11567.44)", of the water quote to do that i'm sorry commissioner meyer yes yeah,11561.44,11567.44
"(11567.44, 11573.2)", are you okay do you have any other questions are you comfortable with no it seems to me uh that uh,11567.44,11573.2
"(11574.0, 11581.76)", the question of the permit um and the question of a fine um really is irrelevant given the,11574.0,11581.76
"(11581.76, 11586.18)", statements in the code and the laws i understand it as you explained it as a,11581.76,11586.18
"(11586.18, 11592.54)", matter of fact so I I I am uncomfortable with this situation um don't like to be in a position as a,11586.18,11592.54
"(11592.54, 11600.28)", commissioner to uh to be uh looking the other way if you will and uh and also uh by virtue of that,11592.54,11600.28
"(11600.28, 11606.66)", encouraging other people to do the same conduct the same kind of activity so I'm I'm,11600.28,11606.66
"(11606.66, 11614.1)", an easy with that and I've been uneasy before and it's uh I don't think it seems like we're,11606.66,11614.1
"(11614.1, 11619.6)", really doing our job as far as the law is concerned appreciate that perspective Commissioner,11614.1,11619.6
"(11619.6, 11627.44)", my understanding is the goods have applied for the permit and so so I don't think they're trying to violate,11619.6,11627.44
"(11627.44, 11635.0)", well it's an after the fact permit but this permit has been pending the application I understand yep,11627.44,11635.0
"(11635.0, 11639.92)", all right commissioners do you have any other questions oh Neil commissioner Hannes go ahead,11635.0,11639.92
"(11641.66, 11653.0)", thank you uh well certainly uh staff we recognize that we've got a long list of things we need to accomplish in doing our work for this commission.,11641.66,11653.0
"(11653.0, 11665.64)"," And you want to dispense with items as they come before the board, even though sometimes you don't have perfect information or absolute consensus, census or the matter would be would benefit from Community building that we're really not resourced",11653.0,11665.64
"(11665.64, 11672.96)", to to support much more than the current level um and yet I and so we don't want to kick cans down,11665.64,11672.96
"(11672.96, 11679.02)", the road where you know we're just not doing our job and making a decision uh with less than,11672.96,11679.02
"(11679.02, 11685.78)", perfect information but in this case uh I just think there's some things that would benefit from a little bit more time.,11679.02,11685.78
"(11686.78, 11693.36)"," And it's not just, as we've said, it's not just for the value of this one permit.",11686.78,11693.36
"(11693.9, 11699.3)", It sets some precedents that could be troubling if we move too precipitously.,11693.9,11699.3
"(11700.28, 11702.78)", So you've got the SHPTI issue.,11700.28,11702.78
"(11702.94, 11704.6)", You've got the commercial use issue.,11702.94,11704.6
"(11704.6, 11714.6)"," You've got TMK identification issues and questions, which I'm not saying that the concerns are correct or not.",11704.6,11714.6
"(11714.6, 11728.52)"," It's just that they've been raised today. And I think this, we would really benefit from leaning in a little bit more on this to see if we can sort some of that out and I would say that with respect to the opportunity.",11714.6,11728.52
"(11729.84, 11731.0)", For Community building.,11729.84,11731.0
"(11732.24, 11745.76)"," I guess I kind of said it, it is an opportunity and not just a duty and that opportunity falls, not just to the community itself there are some really reasonable people who have",11732.24,11745.76
"(11745.76, 11751.6)", spoken on both sides of this issue here before us today from our community and they're all impressive,11745.76,11751.6
"(11751.6, 11758.48)", and i just can you guys just talk and and uh i i hope the meeting works out so the goose can go to,11751.6,11758.48
"(11759.12, 11766.1)", uh the meeting that meets regularly on mondays that uh k Moku has talked about. I hope some of this stuff can get sorted.,11759.12,11766.1
"(11766.22, 11768.94)", I hope that our Shipki folks can make a site visit.,11766.22,11768.94
"(11769.64, 11774.66)"," And it seems like we've got some low-hanging fruit that, you know,",11769.64,11774.66
"(11774.7, 11777.54)", can be accomplished in a short order.,11774.7,11777.54
"(11778.04, 11783.24)"," And if things fall out of that, that bring this into,",11778.04,11783.24
"(11784.2, 11787.44)", bring us closer to consensus and closer to clarity,11784.2,11787.44
"(11787.44, 11793.2)", on the issues and address the concerns about uh precedent setting uh setting precedence that that,11787.44,11793.2
"(11793.76, 11800.0)", may produce unintended consequences i think we we better off uh i don't know what how that jams up,11793.76,11800.0
"(11800.0, 11806.0)", future schedules of work for the staff or for this the agendas of this commission but it just feels,11800.0,11806.0
"(11806.0, 11810.4)", like we would benefit from a little bit more time and seeing this having this come back to us,11806.0,11810.4
"(11811.36, 11815.36)", holla for that wisdom commissioner hannes are you proposing a motion,11811.36,11815.36
"(11818.32, 11829.48)"," i i i'd like to hear staff's response to that uh you know and and then if so, perhaps offer a motion.",11818.32,11829.48
"(11831.16, 11845.96)"," So I'll start. Hearing the sentiment of the Commission as a decision making body, I'm going to defer and work with the applicants and the community through some of the issues identified. I will say on some of the questions raised",11831.16,11845.96
"(11845.96, 11848.0)"," about ownership and legal issues,",11845.96,11848.0
"(11848.0, 11849.68)"," we'll consult with our EGs,",11848.0,11849.68
"(11849.68, 11853.52)", but I don't know how long or how fast that's gonna take.,11849.68,11853.52
"(11853.52, 11855.86)", And we can coordinate with SHIPTI as well.,11853.52,11855.86
"(11855.86, 11859.88)"," Again, I had no control over them as a sister agency.",11855.86,11859.88
"(11859.88, 11864.6)", So I will say that I am concerned,11859.88,11864.6
"(11864.6, 11867.52)", that we're gonna continue to move this out and that,11864.6,11867.52
"(11867.52, 11871.78)", the GOODS have been applicants in this process since 2018.,11867.52,11871.78
"(11871.78, 11877.28)", And so I just want to acknowledge them for their patience through this process if we,11871.78,11877.28
"(11877.28, 11880.68)", do decide to differ.,11877.28,11880.68
"(11880.68, 11886.48)", Thank you very much sorry chair did you want me to respond to um commissioner,11880.68,11886.48
"(11887.04, 11893.2)", i think it was commissioner uh myers question or do you feel comfortable i mean i can give some,11887.04,11893.2
"(11893.2, 11900.4)", general you know some general general information about article 12 second seven it's it's basically,11893.2,11900.4
"(11900.4, 11908.16)"," it's it's what chair chang said right it's it's reaffirming that the state protects all rights,",11900.4,11908.16
"(11908.76, 11913.76)"," customarily and traditionally exercised for subsistence,",11908.76,11913.76

"(11920.72, 11923.12)", for descendants of Native Hawaiian and it goes on.,11920.72,11923.12
"(11924.16, 11928.72)", And then just to remind you of the provision,11924.16,11928.72
"(11928.72, 11933.72)"," in your water code, which is 174C-101,",11928.72,11933.72

"(11944.38, 11948.28)", And it doesn't really go to this specific issue,11944.38,11948.28
"(11948.28, 11949.92)"," and Kalero's nodding his head,",11948.28,11949.92

"(11954.42, 11957.18)", So a deeper dive would be needed,11954.42,11957.18
"(11957.18, 11958.48)"," to answer your specific question,",11957.18,11958.48

"(11974.18, 11974.68)", I'm sorry.,11974.18,11974.68
"(11974.68, 11975.18)", I know.,11974.68,11975.18
"(11977.88, 11981.78)", There's just one big great body that provides this concept.,11977.88,11981.78
"(11981.78, 11983.44)"," Either Dean or Aaron, did you want",11981.78,11983.44
"(11983.44, 11988.0)", to add anything to Commissioner Hannes' summary?,11983.44,11988.0
"(11988.0, 11999.0)"," Or Kaleo's response? Just that we know that there are unpermitted diversions across the state, not just in Cahoma,",11988.0,11999.0
"(11999.0, 12004.0)", but that we are trying to get them on the books as rapidly as possible.,11999.0,12004.0
"(12004.0, 12006.48)"," And we've been working with the Guths,",12004.0,12006.48
"(12006.48, 12009.84)", and they've been patient with us for five years.,12006.48,12009.84
"(12009.84, 12016.76)"," And they're the ones who are, they've",12009.84,12016.76
"(12016.76, 12020.4)", been moving forward the fastest trying,12016.76,12020.4
"(12020.4, 12023.78)", to get their use of or the withdrawal of water,12020.4,12023.78
"(12023.78, 12028.56)", legal in a sense um but just as,12023.78,12028.56
"(12028.56, 12035.36)", mentioned upstream of them or at least four other locations where we have a documented uh water,12028.56,12035.36
"(12035.36, 12040.8)", withdrawals from the stream that aren't haven't been issued stream diversion works permits and,12035.36,12040.8
"(12040.8, 12047.2)", this is just the permit for them to take water this isn't an allocation of water,12040.8,12047.2
"(12047.2, 12055.04)", this isn't a judgment per se just that their use of water is reasonable so that's that's all I,12047.2,12055.04
"(12055.04, 12061.52)", wanted to say and just to follow up on that I think it while you know I the goose have been,12055.04,12061.52
"(12061.52, 12066.48)", patient and working towards have been grading cooperating to get to,12061.52,12066.48
"(12066.48, 12076.08)"," this point. I understand that deferring may be a good option just in because of these other issues,",12066.48,12076.08
"(12076.08, 12086.3)"," you know, these other divers that Aaron mentioned will face similar issues in all likelihood and so yeah to me it makes sense to work through",12076.08,12086.3
"(12086.3, 12094.04)", these issues um before we um before we make a dis before you folks make a decision and bring,12086.3,12094.04
"(12094.04, 12100.4)", it back to the commission at a future date thank you yeah the issue for instance commercial use of,12094.04,12100.4
"(12100.4, 12105.92)", uh I mean that could take a long time so I I'm not sure you're going to get some counsel on that,12100.4,12105.92
"(12105.92, 12111.68)", but i'm not sure we want to wait until that's what we totally work that issue through uh but i mean,12105.92,12111.68
"(12111.68, 12117.52)", there's an issue here i mean the for the goose benefit i mean we need time to get chipti over,12111.68,12117.52
"(12117.52, 12122.48)", there because right now you're looking at a recommendation that requires you to to hire a,12117.52,12122.48
"(12122.48, 12125.12)", cultural consultant and that's not necessarily,12122.48,12125.12
"(12125.12, 12130.48)", what i've heard you want to do although you can speak for yourself on that issue but so i think,12125.12,12130.48
"(12130.48, 12134.64)", there's a benefit to you to have us take this time to work through through some of these issues,12130.48,12134.64
"(12136.0, 12140.0)", and if if you're amenable to that unless you see a great hardship,12136.0,12140.0
"(12140.72, 12153.98)", uh can you can speak to this issue of a deferral go ahead we're fine with it yes okay we're willing to work with shifty if they're willing,12140.72,12153.98
"(12153.98, 12159.26)", to come over yeah we would love them to do a survey our our chair is very persuasive and she,12153.98,12159.26
"(12159.26, 12166.0)", seems to she seems to know a guy so uh i think i think uh I think we can make that happen.,12159.26,12166.0
"(12166.0, 12170.26)"," Chair, I would like to move that we defer item C1.",12166.0,12170.26
"(12173.08, 12179.24)"," And Kaleo is two months a good, and have it come back to us",12173.08,12179.24
"(12179.24, 12182.44)", within two months?,12179.24,12182.44
"(12182.44, 12183.94)", It's not an endless thing?,12182.44,12183.94
"(12183.94, 12189.62)", I wouldn't put a time frame on it just because some of the issues that you brought up might,12183.94,12189.62
"(12189.62, 12194.8)"," take longer and I don't know if it's gonna, we can resolve in two months.",12189.62,12194.8
"(12194.8, 12199.9)"," We can shoot for two months, but so that would be me, right?",12194.8,12199.9
"(12199.9, 12203.24)"," So again, we won't be looking for perfect information and total resolution of every",12199.9,12203.24
"(12203.24, 12209.32)"," single issue, but at least let's take care of the low hanging fruit that we can resolve.",12203.24,12209.32
"(12209.32, 12214.84)", And if we can defer this matter to address the concerns that have been raised at this,12209.32,12214.84
"(12214.84, 12219.6)"," hearing and then bring it back to us as soon as practical, practicable.",12214.84,12219.6
"(12219.6, 12220.6)", Okay.,12219.6,12220.6
"(12220.6, 12222.6)", Motion's been made.,12220.6,12222.6

"(12229.76, 12235.04)", can i just ask one oh go ahead commissioner meyer uh thanks very much neil uh thanks for your help,12229.76,12235.04
"(12235.04, 12250.32)"," on this i think it's headed in the right direction um you're right and uh that's all good. Kaleo, way to go. I would like to ask that we ask the AG's office for clarity",12235.04,12250.32
"(12250.32, 12257.48)"," on the question of commercial use. And if possible, on a priority basis, it seems like",12250.32,12257.48
"(12257.48, 12267.04)", it's a narrow enough issue at this point that somebody ought to be able to write a memo on that and give us proper legal advice,12257.48,12267.04
"(12267.84, 12276.64)", fairly promptly but i don't know it's uh that lies with the ag's office but thanks very much,12267.84,12276.64
"(12276.64, 12283.04)", and chair uh that's fine i'll be happy to support this i i would like to condition this resolution,12276.64,12283.04

"(12286.96, 12290.28)", but I don't think that that's going to make them uncomfortable.,12286.96,12290.28
"(12290.28, 12292.48)", So we shan't do that.,12290.28,12292.48
"(12292.48, 12293.48)", Thank you.,12292.48,12293.48
"(12293.48, 12302.46)"," Can I just ask, as a practical matter, pending final approval or action by the Commission,",12293.48,12302.46
"(12302.46, 12308.08)", what happens to the existing diversion do they continue to use it not,12302.46,12308.08
"(12308.08, 12314.16)", use it we haven't issued a cease and desist so um a lot of that has to do with crops that have,12308.08,12314.16
"(12314.16, 12320.16)", already been planted and working with them um you know again you know trying to be flexible with the,12314.16,12320.16
"(12320.16, 12327.6)", party that's doing making an effort to comply um if we did do that there would be loss of crops,12320.16,12327.6
"(12327.6, 12334.56)", and support so again the from our looking at it holistically the quantity being requested the,12327.6,12334.56
"(12334.56, 12341.52)", quantity being used um isn't drying up a stream isn't necessarily affecting downstream users so,12334.56,12341.52
"(12341.52, 12347.9)"," at this point in time i i'm not, we're not recommending them to stop using water",12341.52,12347.9
