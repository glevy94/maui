Request and Delegation of Authority to Chairperson to Enter into a Joint Funding Agreement with U.S. Geological Survey For Statewide Hydrologic Data Collection and Water Resource Monitoring for Federal Fiscal Year (FFY) 2024, and Declare that Project is Exempt from Environmental Assessment Requirements under Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 343 and Hawaii Administrative Rules Chapter 11.200.1
Dr. Ayron Strauch, CWRM Stream Protection and Management Branch
Dr. Strauch provided a summary of the Joint Funding Agreement and gave updates on monitoring stations across the State.
Questions? So, ADC didn’t respond?
They did not.
Maybe we should send them another letter.
They also lost their chairperson, so they’ve been going through some transition periods.
Seems to be a simple yes or no.
I agree.
Dawn, do you know if ADC is still a state agency or is it a?
It’s administratively attached to DBEDT. So, they do have an acting director, Mark Takemoto. Maybe it’s time, maybe we just have to revisit because Wahiawa Ditch, I mean that may end up becoming a state...
Or maybe we can just turn the water off. Make them answer.
Well, there will be people above our paygrade who will not be happy with that. Ayron, what is our cost here? There’s a table one and a table two.
So, is that what we’re paying? Is that what this is?
Yes. We are paying the $999,964 of the total agreement cost which is $1,231,078.
Is that out of a general fund? Where are we getting that from? Dr. Strauch: It’s a combination of general and special funds.
And that’s on plan, I mean we anticipated this, we have the funds for it.
Yup.
Ayron, excuse me chair.
No, no please go ahead.
That’s the table I’m sort of getting to. Is that the normal ongoing operating cost for the entire system, about a million a year?
Unfortunately, with inflation the costs went up quite a bit, unanticipated costs. I had anticipated that the costs would be more like $950,000 for us, but it was about $50,000 more than expected just because of inflation. We have over the years, I don’t know if I documented it in this, but we’ve added something around 17 stations since 2014 to improve our understanding of the impacts of management on water supply as well as climate change and re-establishing some of these long-term stations so we’ve really built up a more robust network than what existed 10 years ago and that has cost.
So, the USGS relationship is always going to be an 80/20.
Unfortunately, I believe their matching dollars have remained static for like 30 years. I mean Chris might be able to comment on the Federal side, but just because we add another station doesn’t mean, on the Federal side, they get more money.
I guess that was sort of the genesis of my question with Chris is that, what’s the breaks on, we have a plan or we have a dream of what gaging stations are important to us and it seems like the ceiling becomes Federal funds if we want to maintain that 80/20 relationship.
Agreed. Deputy Manuel was able to request from the legislature with the previous chair’s assistance, addition to our general funds that help support the additional gaging five years ago. Our ceiling isn’t necessarily the Federal side, but it is a combination of Federal and State.
If I can, Chair, we’ve been coordinating with our counterparts at USGS and as well as our Congressional delegation to really look at increasing the Federal matching percentage and the funding that goes to this specific program and this is in partnership with other state agencies that benefit from USGS data. It’s a nationwide attempt to try to increase that budget, that Federal budget which then also helps us go across the street and ask for additional funds to show the leverage that’s happening. We’ve consistently every year asked for an increase to our base funding to add potentially five gages and focus on streams every year which on average what we budget was about $250,000. And if we do that every biennium, we should be able to over the course of, I think we pencil it on it’ll take 20 years, but that’s the reality right and we’ve been trying to be realistic about our asks as well as the capacity of USGS to install gages.
Is that consistent with what our assumptions are with the climate change models that we’ve been looking at over the past year or two?
Is that funding?
No, the amount of gaging stations that we’re putting in to try to manage.
We have a Water Resource Monitoring Needs Assessment the USGS published three years ago.
Yeah, 2020.
That identifies all the climate, surface water, and groundwater monitoring needs that the State has. You use that as kind of our baseline, but obviously we need 80 more stream gages or something like that and we have to make a decision on which one to add next year. We really focus on very high priority sites that are involved in litigation, involved with the water leasing process, tied to instream flow standards; areas that we call hot, hot areas for us.
As well as streams that can act as proxies for larger research. So that was the balance with the monitoring program and attempt to say ‘Hey, with the budget we have, let’s come up with a strategy to build out our monitoring system in anticipation of climate change. Obviously, we may need to redirect resources as needed, but in general if this is the path and the plan that both USGS as well as us here at the Water Commission can take, we can move and adjust as needed, but we needed like a general plan, right? A navigation plan to get us where we need to go.
But a 20-year horizon seems a bit far.
I used that number broadly based on various criteria and limits. A lot of it’s budget, the other one is USGS’s capacity to install gages. You know the more money we get the more Federal funding they get, they can bring on more staff and add more gages. So, there are a lot of conditions that need to be considered whether that timeframe increases or decreases.
But we know that data is critical to informed decision making. How do we share the cost? There are others who are benefiting from this work. I mean we’re just now going after the county water departments, but I mean are there other whether they’re military, whether they’re private purveyors. Can we assess like some kind of a monitoring fee? How do we do this? We need to think about it.
Chair, the Water Resource Protection Plan adopted in 2019 looked at how to help sufficiently fund this type of data collection at work because getting people to pay for data is really difficult. Obviously, we wish we had data when we want to make decisions, but we are not always investing in it proactively. So, part of that strategy was to look at ways in which we could look at, for example, regulatory fees or that would then be shared amongst all users that would go towards funding stream gages that they benefit from as end users. Those things we’ve been working through. A lot of it has to go through rule making in order for us to pursue those types of fees. And or if there’s need for legislation then that’s something else we need to consider. I will say it’s hard, it has been difficult and challenging to add more fees to things, but data collection somebody’s got to pay for it. We’re looking at multiple ways to do that. We’re also looking at accessing other Federal programs that can help us support the work that we’re doing. I know in prior conversation, I think it was Commissioner Hannahs, brought up ideas of philanthropic supports. We have tried to coordinate as much as possible with other organizations to leverage funding.
To build on your question, we are not the only cooperator. For example, the City and County Department of planning and Department of Environmental Management are cooperators for maybe six stream gages related to water quality monitoring or NPDS development. Army does monitor or cost share a couple of stations, so like the Waipahu Stream near Wheeler Field, that’s a stream up in Mililani. And then Army Corps of Engineers also supports certain streams, especially in the Ala Wai watershed.
Department of Transportation also is a huge presence, mostly for flood- prone streams to protect highways and bridges.
All right. Any other questions? Do I have a motion? Oh, I’m sorry. Paul do you have one? No?
Lucienne, I think, is here for public testimony.
Oh I’m sorry, Lucienne, you’re here for Item B-1? Would you like to provide testimony?
Yes, I would. Excuse me, I need to plug in my computer, it tells me it’s about to die. All right, there we go, we’re plugged in. Thank you, I really appreciate all the discussion and moving the report by Director Curran up so that we really could get this big picture of how the monitoring program works. I’m testifying in full support of having the authority to proceed to get the data we need. It’s obvious that USGS is the gold standard of getting this kind of information and presenting it in a way that it can, been applied where it needs to be applied. Fun fact, when we were a territory and didn’t have a Department of Land and Natural Resources, USGS acted kind of de facto as our, for our territory as a Department of Land and Natural Resources. They did lots of gages and monitoring and studies and reports and things, so they’re a long and trusted partner. I would like to echo Commissioner Hannahs’ comments that there is longer term knowledge available. I would like to suggest some partner groups and I’m sorry, I’m a little disorganized today. I don’t have this in writing, but I will send in writing. There are partner groups in all parts of the island that do have what’s called generational knowledge and a lot of information about streams for instance can be derived from the amount of infrastructure for kalo cultivation that is around those streams. A lot of times these areas have had archaeological dating as well so we can know that in the 1500s, there was enough water to support so many acres of kalo cultivation. And I do know, having worked with some of the former USGS staff members that have come to Maui to Na Wai ‘Eha or East Maui where I live, that they are interested in knowing what the local families who have watched things for years and years have seen. They don’t always have a way to quantify that, but they do take it into account when they are trying to plan their test runs and things like that. They can get a lot of good advice. So please consider in this model your local, cultural organizations and there are many in Maui. There are cultural organizations, and I will send in a list and contact information, in every part of the island and these are great resources. I also want to say that we really need to understand how our aquifers and our surface water interrelate. For instance, an earlier USGS report indicated that restoring stream flows to even you know, basically small amounts, but significant amounts, actually helped the health of the county well system in Na Wai ‘Eha. I’m sure the same would be true in West Maui. I think the USGS study in 2012-2013 concluded that as well. We really need to be very long-range thinking about stream flow standards and the good that they do in order to keep the aquifers recharged and because we depend on the aquifers so much. Thank you to Director Manuel and Chair Chang and all the Commission staff and members for supporting this important work and to USGS for always being there for us.
