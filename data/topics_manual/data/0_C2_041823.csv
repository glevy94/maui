Joint Task Force Red Hill, Navy, and Defense Health Agency Overviews/Updates of Defueling, Site Remediation and Closure, Red Hill Shaft Recovery and Monitoring, and Medical Support to Families
Maj General Mark Hashimoto, U.S Marine Corps Thanks everyone for the opportunity to provide updates from organizations involved in the defueling, site cleanup, aquifer-related activities, and medical support to families. Navy Region Hawai‘i and Naval Facilities Engineering command, have provided several detailed updates to the commission since the beginning of 2022. Joint Task Force Red Hill and Defense Health Agency will be providing information directly to the commission for the first time. These organizations have made many public appearances to ensure that questions and concerns associated with the response to Red Hill can be addressed. Each organization will present a brief update on what they are doing, mainly focusing on updates, and looking forward to discussions.
Colonel Kevin Williams, the Chief of Staff for the JTF Red Hill Colonel Kevin Williams, the chief of staff for the Joint Task Force Red Hill, thanks everyone for allowing them to present their mission and update their timeline. He works for Admiral Wade andwill discuss their mission and timeline while also answering any questions. (See PowerPoint presentation.)
Sarah Moody, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Hawai‘I Sarah Moody, with the Naval facilities engineering command Hawa ‘i, specifically on the Red Hill environmental team that was stood up in response to the events that happened in November of 2021 impacting the drinking water system. They have been tasked with a specific mission of the recovery and remediation of our aquifer and the water sources in Hawai‘i and specifically the drinking water system that serves Joint Base Hawai‘i. She will provide an overview and continue with a PowerPoint presentation. Red Hill Remediation Actions Schedule. General Mark Hashimoto mentioned that there is a fine print at the bottom of the document, and this is related to Colonel William’s statement about preserving decision space. The document is subject to change, and they want to make sure people understand that. The accuracy of the document is as of today.
Captain Cameron Geertsma, Commanding Officer for Naval facilities Engineering assistance command Hawai‘i Captain Cameron Geertsma, commanding officer for Naval facilities engineering assistance command Hawai'i, that’s the NAVFAC side of the house, but then there's also the Commander Navy region wh he’s representing today, Admiral Barnett, as his staff civil engineer went over Red Hill Tank Closure on PowerPoint presentation.
Kevin Nakamura, Chief Medical Officer for the defense health agency region Indo-Pacific Kevin Nakamura, chief medical officer for the defense health agency region indo-pacific. They are the lead agency responsible for health care for individuals and families that were impacted by the Red Hill JP5 fuel contamination incident. In early January, they started the Red Hill Clinic to take care of military service members and military beneficiaries. (See PowerPoint presentation.)
thank the presenters for their excellent presentation and I note four fundamental commitments: to mitigate or remediate the contamination that’s in that aquifer, to defuel the tanks to eliminate future risks, to develop a community-accepted plan for repurposing the tanks, and to take care of the affected citizens. I have concerns about how long the system will be offline and I’m pleased to see a comprehensive plan for dealing with it. If I read this correctly, the tanks will be defueled by June 2024? is asking if there is an end date for the remediation of the contamination and if you are working towards a specific date for when the water systems can be brought back online for drinking? I acknowledge that things can change and it’s important to have a plan and variance reporting, but I’m seeking a better understanding of the timeline for remediation.
there is currently no clear timeline for the environmental remediation of the Red Hill facility, as a comprehensive site assessment and defueling of tanks are needed to identify contamination not only from the events that happened in November of 2021 but also look for anypotential contamination from other things that have happened at Red Hill over the last 80 years. There is the pursuit of a water treatment plant for the Red Hill shaft, but regulatory approval is required before it can be approved as a drinking water source. The temporary project for this is set for 2025, and the permanent project for 2027, after the tanks are defueled. The Navy Aiea Halawa shaft is being pursued on an emergency basis and treatment options are being explored as a contingency measure for the community’s protection.
what I take from that is that this system which supplies 25 percent of drinking water for O‘ahu will be offline at least until 2027?
there is potential in 2025 to have a temporary system stood up in place while the long-term system is being built but that is dependent on regulatory approval.
so, the tank repurposing, that decision would be made next month with the DOH’s approval? Did I read that correctly?
a decision-making process with the Department of Health (DOH) and regulators, potentially related to supplement number two. Currently, we are following option one but are open to changing to another methodology if necessary. I want to emphasize the importance of submitting all relevant information to DOH to make an informed decision in partnership with their team. We do not want to speak for DOH but believe that it is important to keep the momentum going and support moving into other options if necessary.
It is important to create a plan for remediation and defueling once a decision has been made about which option to pursue in order to move towards closure on the issue. There is the need for a clear goal and tracking progress towards targeted outcomes and appreciates that progress is being made in this direction. However, I note that this plan addresses only one-third of the overall issue, which includes determining how long the O‘ahu-based system will be offline. It is also important to consider the pressures on other parts of the system that are meeting the demand that was once met by this part, and whether they are meeting existing allocations and future demand sustainability. Additionally, the need to develop new sources that don’t rely on the offline aquifer.
we are working on understanding the whole system and aquifers as a whole, and managing everyone’s uses, including the Navy, is important from a regulatory standpoint. Data is important and I encourage others to support the commission’s regulatory role by providing timely and accurate data. There may be other priorities to consider but the ones mentioned are in alignment.
we want to stay on top of any plans to open up sources in emergency situations and are actively monitoring data to understand potential environmental impacts. I agree with Kaleo that reporting is important, and actively monitoring the data that comes from reporting is the second component of our efforts.
We are trying to work more closely with the Board of Water Supply to have a collaborative engagement with them, which will help make better decisions with good data. There are some bills in the process through the legislature that may give us additional tools to manage and regulate the system better. The governor’s office is looking at this comprehensively, and the Navy has to partner with them to help make better decisions through good data.
how often can we track or anticipate tracking the progress against the milestones?
I suggest that the Navy may not have to come to CWRM on a monthly basis but instead provide written updates. The purpose of creating a platform was to get good information and provide the Navy with an opportunity to give accurate, current information. I suggest that they provide the commission with more regular updates, which may not necessarily be in-person presentations but could be written.
they should come before the commission at least quarterly to have a report unless there's a significant variance, in which case they should report to the commission whenever it occurs.
to address the Commissioners’ concerns, we can forward the schedule for Navy outreach meetings, which can provide opportunities for the community engagement and updates on remediation and closure efforts. This way, the Navy doesn’t have to directly address these issues to the Commission during their meetings, and the Commissioners can receive more regular updates. However, the commission may need to request updates on allocations and other matters they are responsible for as necessary.
I am in agreement with Commissioner Hannahs regarding the usefulness of the synoptic view of plans, particularly because the written plans can be difficult to understand. I suggest that it would be helpful to have alternating presentations from the Navy or organizations represented in the group and the groundwater staff to understand and have a more informed view of the aquifer sector areas such as Waimalu, Moanalua, or Pearl Harbor. I also suggest that the public meetings be shared on the commission’s Red Hill page so that the public can access them. Can I get clarification on some terms used in the Navy’s infographics, particularly in the Gantt chart. There were three or four words that were repeated – dewatering, repacking, and unforeseen repairs, and maintenance before defueling.
Dewatering is removing built-up condensation from the tanks to prevent corrosion and repacking is the process of reintroducing fuel into the lines to stabilize the equilibrium before defueling. Unforeseen repairs and maintenance is a window of time set aside to ensure that all conditions are set for repairs and response drills and training to ensure that all personnel are certified and ready to go. The tank bottom procedure review involves draining the remaining fuel from the main tanks, which is not at the pipe that drains into the main line. The overall process involves a series of iterations that use the same safety. We can simplify the information in the Gantt chart and provide further updates as we drill down with regulators.
it does help, and it is my understanding that there’s tremendous pressure from these tall tanks, which is part of the safety issues, and that moving fuel is risky business.
The repairs being done are to ensure the integrity of the system for defueling, and they are being done deliberately and with the help of regulators and third-party quality validation. The dewatering process is also being used to check and ensure the response plan is in place for safe operations. The team is moving fast but also prioritizing safety.
there have been concerns about the possibility of a change in the defueling plan due to national security during the window of unforeseen repair and maintenance Colonel Williams, do you have any comments on that. She also appreciated the explanation of technical terms and believes it helps establish better transparency and dialogue. However, there is still significant concern about the lengthy timeline and the possibility that the plans may change.
we are committed to the Secretary of Defense’s decision on March 7th to defuel and permanently close the Red Hill facility and that that is the only decision that is out there and that is what we are moving toward every single day.
I had one more question for NAVFAC, Sarah Moody, as I was a bit confused about that diagram. I see a lot of monitoring and investigation and also remediation and actual remediation. Why is it called remediation when it’s more monitoring? I was frustrated because there isn’t even a discussion of what you are going to do besides measure.
we are actively working on remediation efforts at the site of the spill that occurred in November 2021 at Red Hill. We have already excavated contaminated soil, are using vapor monitoring ports to remove any remaining fuel and are skimming and removing fuel from the aquifer. There is a need for a larger, holistic approach to environmental care and remediation at the entire facility, beyond just the specific site of the spill. The remediation efforts will continue until everyone agrees that they have been successful and that monitoring, and remediation activities are occurring concurrently.
can you confirm that there's still free product coming into the shaft as mentioned? It’s about a tablespoon per month?
yes. So usually, we only see a sheen of free product after a large rain event and when we do, we're able to collect it with the skimmers and the booms in the shaft and it's an average of a teaspoon to a tablespoon a month right now.
what do we know about transport of safe dissolved contaminants beyond the Navy Sentinel Wells and immediate proximity, including the additional nine? As someone smart told me the horse is out of barn. (Meaning that the contaminants have already been released, and so the question is what is known about the situation?)
The original goal of adding 22 monitoring wells was to create a plume delineation to identify where contamination had moved and to monitor if any contamination had moved, then to put them on the outskirts of Red Hill, to be able to either tell us if there had been a large transfer or indicate if any contamination was moving to those locations. The results that they are getting from those P Wells or plume delineation wells show that they don't have a lot of contamination outside of the immediate area of Red Hill. Their heat maps are showing that it's contracted down to the area directly below the tanks from the historical spill since 2014 and then right around the Red Hill shaft where they continue to do operations. The purpose of monitoring wells is to gather weekly data to give definitive answers on any transport of contamination and to look at it from a comprehensive standpoint, including any byproducts of the breakdown of fuel. So, they are looking at it from a comprehensive standpoint of not just current free-flowing fuel but if there are any byproducts of the breakdown of fuel. That's also the efforts of the modeling of what they're trying to do is to be able to create a model to identify where any contaminant may go if an event were to occur or predict potentially where any contaminants went from the events that occurred in 2021.
There was a February 2022 heat map that looked like there was a plume that quickly dissipated. Is there a current interpretation on your end? Was it just advected away or was that natural attenuation? Is their understanding of that because that heat map really lit up in 2022 and if you're not picking up anymore where did it go?
a lot of it was removed directly from the Red Hill shaft. The continuous pumping of the gas allowed them to get free product off the top of the shaft and allowed them to remove as much as possible. I think there is a level of natural attenuation and that if you speak with experts, they will say that's occurring as well as what's happening in the strata. We do hope to eventually pursue studies that will give them more definitive information on natural attenuation.
there is data related to monitoring wells and TPH hits and spikes. The presence of TPH doesn’t necessarily indicate a large amount of contamination. The current data shows fewer TPH hits than during the most extreme scenario. The goal is to recover every last drop of fuel, and the science behind defining natural attenuation and modeling transport. Partnerships are important and positive progress to make risk-based decisions. The end date for the project will depend on permitting, transparency, and belief and the focus will be on closing the site permanently before beginning broader remediation. Working on both remediation and closure simultaneously poses some challenges.
The Navy does not have a good track record in Hawai‘i of stewardship like Kaho‘olawe, M kua, and that have UXO that still cannot be restored. There's this recommendation or option one by the Navy as the least impactful environmental option because there won't be trucks. It’s sort of in Congress with the reality that many people still can’t do ecological restoration in certain areas because of UXO or because of contamination. So, what may be fast for the Navy to close the books on leaves a long legacy for Hawai‘i and residents. I want to challenge you to think about what's best in the short term and then there's what may make sense for the rest of us in the long term. We are here for generations and beyond so please consider that DOH recommendation.
for start, reducing the amount of non-potable water being put in H lawa stream. Also, the long-term remediation is being considered, including the establishment of appropriate monitor wells outside of Red Hill are critical. There are legal issues with monitoring wells on private land, but it is critical to put them in to deal with the contamination and spread of the plume, something that both DOH and DLNR can work with the private landowners. The Navy has offered resources and they’re willing to put the wells in, but until they are in place, it will be difficult to establish the type of science needed to understand how we can open the aquifer again. From a planning perspective it may take one to three years to have that type of science that they feel capable of opening the aquifer again. Finally, to remind the Navy that the Water Commission is not an official regulator, but they have broad regulatory authority with permits and permit modifications. The Navy’s request for emergency use didn’t go to the Water Commission, but there’s a lot of issues on the aquifer besides the Navy’s use of it. Over pumping, even in the short term, could affect other issues that the Navy may not be aware of. The presentation provided by the Navy has been positive and productive, and it is appreciated.
(question for Ms. Moody) Could you describe the organization that will be managing the water system long term? There are a lot of improvements, enhancements, and measuring devices that will be installed within the next two years. What would that organization look like and how would that organization be able to capture and maintain institutional knowledge, which was an issue faced in the Red Hill problem. Is there a better use for the water instead of putting it into the stream if the Navy continues to pump three million gallons a day or 1.8 billion gallons a day. He requests help with the organizational structure going forward long term.
when it comes to water, the water system for Joint Base Hawai‘i it is a multi-faceted integrated approach, it is owned by the Joint Base Commander and overseen by their Public Works Officer from the technical infrastructure standpoint. Their team specifically supports the monitoring of water quality and environmental approach related to events that occurred at Red Hill to ensure that the water system remains safe. The operations of the water system will remain with the Joint Base staff and the water teams, and they will continue to support and maintain institutional knowledge by creating collaborative efforts amongst their team. The team was established to provide additional support to deal with the large problem set while the Joint Base staff manages and oversees the drinking water system.
with all the changes that are being instituted and implemented, is that the appropriate organization to manage this system moving forward? And, if the turnover rate in that organization is every three or six years, how do you accumulate that institutional knowledge that you can be able to assess and react to any kind of abnormalities to these systems?
the fuel systems operators and water systems operator are two different factions and organizations. The failure in Red Hill was a fuel systems issue that led to fuel being released into a wellhead that got into a system. The Water systems operators have been working for the joint based public works department for up to 40 years and are essential to the local community. What they are looking at in terms of transition for informational purposes is that the Department of Defense and United States Navy are working together to manage fuel across all locations globally so that they are protecting the environment and communities and operating smartly. As the Joint Task Force completes its mission, there may be a transition back to Navy ownership, but it will not affect how operations are managed and permitted. Lastly, those people are hard-working individuals that have worked tirelessly for a year in a half trying to get to the point where we are.
I guess captain, long term you have now 22 additional Sentinel Wells you have a lot more monitoring responsibility. Is the present management's organization able to do that?
the answer is no, but currently, they can maintain and do what they need to do. In the future in 2024 and 2025, we are looking for opportunities to increase staff to make certain that they don’t fail in their inability to monitor, and we are seeking support from Congress members and Senators to aid in this growth. Communication allows us to move forward with speed and not uniformed, ill-informed speed but to shorten some of those times lines so that regulators can make those decisions with us.
one more question. Is there a risk and threat assessment through the aquifer being assembled or is that comprehended over the DoD facilities? Overall, for all the aquifers, all the DOD facilities to put things in perspective. I think Red Hill has been top of mind and clearly visible. But do we need to worry about the other sleeping dogs?
an initial assessment was conducted at various sites and facilities in the Indo-Pacific region, from far Eastern Japan to Guam. Diego Garcia back to Hawai‘i to evaluate potential risks in partnership with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) and NAVSUP. The assessment included evaluating the proximity of water systems and the potential impact on those systems. I am uncertain as to where it’s at as the focus is specifically on Hawai‘i. The Department, maybe with NAVFAC headquarters is really looking at that.
Thank you.
simply because the tanks have been defueled doesn't excuse the military from their regulatory oversight of the Department of Health to bring safe drinking water to its customers. So, it may require long-term monitoring and it is going to require remediation. There will be lots of steps in between but they will be under regulatory requirements for the aquifer.
is the data was available?
all of it is available.
the department (Department of Health) continues to ask the Navy for data that is readable and accessible. It's one thing to give us data but it's another thing to be able to synthesize it and read it in a in a quick fashion that our people and Board of Water Supply is able to understand it.
data availability and improvement is important to protect the community. There is a need to collect and share data while ensuring regulatory compliance and governance. There was a statement made by Dr. Ho and mentions that involvement of EPA Region 9 and the Assistant Secretary of the Navy is discussing the governance structure and methodology for sharing data. It appears that resources have been a topic of discussion among the commissioners.
we have received feedback and are making improvements. One of these improvements is the creation of an interactive map for drinking water that allows people to find their home and see their results. We are also pursuing a similar approach for groundwater to increase transparency and public outreach. It can be challenging to present scientific chemistry data to a lay community, and therefore we are incorporating tools to aid in understanding and increase public understanding.
we just have this juxtaposed against Dr. Longman’s presentation which was practical and useful. My last point is more of a comment and its sort of the line of Aurora’s comments. Kathy Ho and I we were very privileged to be part of Kaho‘olawe, during the transfer and I remember the Commissioners. I was with the Deputy Attorney General's office and advising the Kaho‘olawe Island Reserve Commission and I do remember Auntie Frenchie, Emmett, many of the Commissioners asking, “Dawn should we take the island back?” And I said, “As your lawyer, no. You're not going to have enough money and you're not going to have enough time. But as a Hawaiian, of course you have to take it because we will never get it back under any other circumstance.” General Hashimoto and it is publicly rhetorical. I know the Secretary of Defense has made a commitment to close and remove. But I want you to think about, will there become a point in time when U.S. DOD says we've put as much technology and money as we can, and this is as good as it's going to get. And it may not be good enough. But again, this is totally above our pay grade with that answer. I don't know what that is we're still struggling with Kaho‘olawe; no surface clearance, no subsurface clearance, people can't even you know it's not habitable. But we took it back because that's as good as it's going to get. So, I know looming against all of this is that ultimate. What are we eventually going to get back? This is so much more critical from a public health and safety perspective. But again, just bear in mind that is sort of for some of us the elephant in the room. At some point in time will the Department of Defense may say we've done all that we can. No, don't need to answer.
Sent in a written testimony but has additional concerns. Condensation is being removed from fuel tanks this week to check fuel quality, and if it is low, the fuel can’t be reused. She asks if dewatering needs to be done prior to defueling again since condensation builds up. Requests for new heat maps showing plumes and monthly updates on a website. Tank tightness was not explained in the Gantt chart, and she asks for tank cleaning to be added to the executive summary. She asks about safeguards during dewatering to prevent fuel release. The failure mode effects analysis can help prevent catastrophes. Thanks, the task force and asks them to ensure the valves are replaced and working properly.
She is from Waimalu and expressed concern about the impact of the Red Hill facility on their community, particularly the last lo‘i kalo in the area. They are unsure if they should be relieved that the aquifer is being recharged or concerned about the spread of PFAS contamination. Her family has a severed relationship with the land due to military contamination and expressed concern about the future of freshwater streams on the island. She questions how the commission will regulate PFAS without disclosure of what chemicals are being stored at the facility and how to hold the DOD accountable for their commitment to gather every last drop without disclosure. She raised concerns about the 200,000 gallons of legacy fuel and what true remediation looks like in Forest Rock. Also expresses concern about the Aiea Halawa shaft being put back online and how it could affect the spread of fuel and other contaminants to the lo‘i kalo and streams in the area. She raised concerns about the repurposing of tanks for non-fuel use and the lack of conversation around foreclosure and decommissioning. She asked if there are capabilities within the commission to hold the Navy accountable and how to access the 43 monitoring wells that will be constructed. She urged the commission to hold the Navy accountable to timelines and harsh punishments to protect the future generations.
Public from Halawa requests a focus on remediation, which has not been discussed in the meeting. Remediation should involve everything from the top to the bottom of the aquifer, not justskimming the top of the water. Natural attenuation (doing nothing) is not a viable option, and indigenous microorganisms that feed on toxins should be considered. There is a need for an accounting of what toxins should be considered. There is a need for what toxins have been brought into Hawai‘i and what is missing in the aquifer. The current system of meetings is not effective in addressing issues, and there needs to be more focus on remediation. The public requests at least a two-hour meeting focused solely on remediation.
She is glad that the water going into H lawa stream has been reduced from 5 million to 3 million but notes that a lot of water has been wasted and needs to find a way to be used. They request a statement from the Secretary of Defense, as well as video of all the PFAS, which they believe should be made available to the public. She also mentions that civilians have been living with the military on their lands and need better care. She appreciates the information provided but believes that some basic questions still need to be answered.
