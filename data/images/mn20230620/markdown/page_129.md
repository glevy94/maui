these are important things. I join with Jonathan. Connecting our watersheds and caring for the whole watershed, and involving the communities in that caring is one of the most important things that we can do if we really don't want to be fighting over less and less water in the future. We need to envision a future when we -- where we -- as we grow water, and that means cooperating with nature.

I also very, very much appreciate your remarks about working with stakeholders to try to avoid contested cases being the only option. Now, obviously, you know, I've been party to many contested cases. Sometimes they are the best option because the story is just too full to tell through even, you know, meeting a few times. But even if you look at Nā Wai ‘Ehā and working towards some of these brokered settlement agreements, it saved everybody time. It is not perfect; we do need more enforcement of what's on paper so it doesn't become just a good-looking decision on paper that on the ground, where's the water? But the idea of bringing people together when possible to find common ground over a shared resource, I think should be very, very high on the purview of the commission like this, and I applaud your efforts. I -- you know, you've made many suggestions to that -- that type of resolution. And Director Chang is really heading in that way as well; your staff is heading in that way.
