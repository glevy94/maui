agriculture and industrial use uses. That's going to be a really thorny question about what part of that is a part of this.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** Water to Hawaiian Homes, as well. Water to Hawaiian Homes beneficiaries, as well.

**COMMISSIONER MIIKE:** Sure, all I'm saying is that aside from the DHHL reservations, domestic uses of the general public is an equal [inaudible] as is the resource itself. Down the road, none of us will be around, but that's going to bump heads and you're going to have to come to some kind of compromise about not everybody can get all the water they want and particularly on the stream. Not all streams are going to have to be [inaudible]. Now, aquifers are a different question. You get beyond the sustainable yield and you start to permanently destroy the aquifer, so that's going to be a different issue.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** I'd like to ask again, do we have a duty to make reservations for other public trust users and you said you didn't know? Could you research that? I mean I'm not sure the Commissioners have time to do that and the resource of theâ€¦

**KATIE ROTH:** I can reframe my response. I don't think it's accurate to say I don't know, I think that there is a duty definitely to public trust uses of water and to find a reasonable, when we have to balance reasonable and beneficial use as well. I think that there's a lot more to say on that topic and that's definitely something that if you want us to investigate, we can definitely do that, to come up with a more formal opinion if that's something that the Commission is interested in.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** I think it'd be very helpful if you could characterize that for us and get a comprehensive opinion in that respect because as Larry said, it's going to come up and it's going to come at us four square at some point with respect to surface water and groundwater, as well. Further, you mentioned that 15% of DHHL needs are being met by current reservations, if I have that correct. Where does that number come from?

**KATIE ROTH:** That 15% is reflected in what we would consider paper water, not all of that is what we would call wet water and I could maybe defer to Andrew again to provide more details.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** You don't know where the numbers come from, you didn't prepare that number yourself?

**KATIE ROTH:** That is the number provided by DHHL.
