Approval of Chairperson’s Appointment of Marvin Kaleo Manuel, as First Deputy to the
Chairperson of the Commission on Water Resource Management
Ms. Katie Roth Hydrologic Planning Program Manager Ms. Roth stated that Mr. Manuel served as Deputy since January 28, 2019, and has been instrumental in moving forward significant decisions by the Commission. A list of those major accomplishments is in the submittal along with his background and resume. Staff stands on the submittal. Chairperson Chang asked Ms. Yoda to read for the record the names of the public testimony received to date and their position on the appointment of Marvin Kaleo Manuel as First Deputy to the Chairperson of the Commission on Water Resource Management.
Aloha, I am in support of B1. Personally, I just want to say I didn’t know his name is Marvin, I’ve known him for 20 years and never thought I’d see any of us doing the kind of work we are doing today. I’m proud of him as an individual. On behalf of my organization, I think Kaleo has opened an ear to the folks in the community to talk about the significance in water to the culture and the ecosystems, the healthy streams and nearshore environment. Mahalo.
We stand on our written testimony: • a list of the Pae ‘Āina so you have a better idea of the scope of the Water Commission and their responsibility to native Hawaiian communities on the eight islands • the Association of Hawaiian Civic Clubs (AHCC), at its annual convention in Seattle, Washington in November 2022 adopted Resolution No. 2022-AA “Urging the Incoming Administration to keep Kaleo Manuel in his current position as Deputy Director of the Commission on Water Resource Management” • in regards to the Ota Well issue in Keauhou, Kona, Kaleo Manuel personally and with his staff, met with kupuna and lawai‘a (fishing practitioners) of Kailua- Kona and the West Hawai‘i coastline as well as with ‘Aha Moku generational ‘ohana of the Keauhou Aquifer and communities of the Public Trust to assist in the mitigation of water withdrawal requests from the Keauhou Aquifer and its impact on traditional ocean practices under the direction of Kaleo Manuel, CWRM employs the Kapa‘akai Analysis to all CWRM applications that deal with water use permitting in the State of Hawai‘i. ‘Aha Moku strongly supports Kaleo Manuel as the Deputy Director, Commission on Water Resource Management.
On behalf of The Sierra Club of Hawai‘i, we strongly support the appointment of Deputy Marvin Kaleo Manuel to continue his vital role as the Water Commission Deputy. Over the past four years, Mr. Manuel has demonstrated a high level of diligence, commitment, and objective solution-seeking in his oversight of the administration and implementation of the State Water Code and the public trust doctrine. Under his leadership, the Water Commission and its staff have been able to successfully realize the prudent planning and protective mechanisms envisioned in our State Water Code including: • updated instream flow standards for streams throughout East Maui • water management designation for West Maui • updated interim instream flow standard for Heʻeia stream, Oʻahu • updated interim instream flow standard for Waiʻoli stream, Kaua‘i For these reasons, the Sierra Club of Hawai‘i respectfully but strongly urges the Commission to approve the appointment and retention of Marvin Kaleo Manuel as the Deputy Director of CWRM.
I’m from Maui and I live in Honokōhau Valley in the moku of Kāʻanapali. I’m testifying in strong support of the appointment of Kaleo Manuel as First Deputy to the Chairperson of the Commission on Water Resource Management. Kaleo has invested and committed to responsibly and proactively caring for not only the kumu wai of our pae ‘āina but also our kaiāulu and lāhui who depend on our water resources. As an ‘ohana who relies on the wai and cares for our natural resources, we respect and appreciate and mahalo Kaleo for always being transparent and pono and for genuinely listening to our concerns and for putting our natural resource first. Mahalo nui. Without wai we are nothing. We know this job requires a special and skilled individual, someone who has the knowledge and ability to work effectively and fairly with this community, always putting our natural resources and those who rely on them first and foremost. In my opinion, Kaleo does all of this and much more. Mahalo nui.
Good afternoon, Chair Chang and members of the Commission, Happy New Year everybody. Nice seeing you and here’s to a good 2023. I’ll keep it short since we all know Kaleo needs to get back to work. You don’t need any encouragement or reminder of how he is objectively truly the best choice for this job. All these supporters and well-wishers, we see how Kaleo as Deputy of the Commission has stepped up its commitment and its progress in fulfilling its public trust kuleana. Of course, credit should go to the Commissioners themselves and all the Commission’s dedicated and hard-working staff, but today is Kaleo’s day. As a decades long advocate for the public trust and an admirer of true public servants, I’m glad that the Commission is keeping the band together here with Kaleo continuing under the new administration. He’s worked hard over the years to grow into this role and we all need him to help lead the Commission in following through on the hard work ahead. Mahalo Kaleo and mahalo Commissioners for voting to confirm. Mahalo.
Aloha mai everyone. I’m a former eight-year, two-term Water Commissioner and served to the best of my ability with many of you here in this room and a pleasure to meet you Chair and appreciate the work that everyone is doing in this capacity. I’m here to strongly support with the utmost confidence the appointment of Kaleo to continue as Deputy. I think it’s critical to continue the momentum that he has been able to achieve. Kaleo is one of the best facilitators I’ve known. As we all know a positive and important role of this Commission is to have a diversity of opinions and interests and Kaleo does a fantastic job facilitating all of that. I can go over numerous cases and decisions where I felt his leadership was pivotal. To be honest, the last day of my term on the Commission when we released the Nā Wai ‘Ehā decision, Kaleo and I were on the phone multiple times. I think some of us remember there were some challenges or errors in that final Decision and Order and Kaleo was just on it through the whole process. I just want to firmly give my support for his leadership and I want to thank your administration for continuing and seeing his service and where it can take us and water in the future for Hawai‘i. Happy to take any questions.
Aloha Chair Chang and Commissioners. I’m testifying today in strong support of agenda item B1. Like many of you, I wear lots of different hats in our community and in that capacity, I have had the great privilege of working closely with Deputy Director Manuel on several issues impacting many different islands across our pae ‘āina, but today I am here in my personal capacity. I have been fortunate to have been appearing before this Commission since the 1990s. Yes, I am that old. I was trying to recall how many Deputies I had worked with over the years from Linnel Nishioka, and Yvonne Izu, to Ken Kawahara and more recently Jeff Pearson and then Kaleo. For me, Kaleo stands out as the very best for all the reasons you have already seen detailed in the voluminous written testimony as well as the people who have already appeared today. My voice joins the chorus of others who are deeply grateful that you, Chair Chang, have nominated Deputy Director Manuel to continue the important work of this Commission. Like Wayne Tanaka, I was also at the meeting four years ago supporting Deputy Director Manuel’s first term and I’m excited to be back here again to support him continuing and as someone who tracks water issues closely. I really scrutinized his work over the last four years and have been impressed not simply with his grasp of the issues but by his integrity and aloha and how as a process person he brings so much to this Commission - I think as Commissioner Beamer pointed out. You’ve already heard a lot from folks and as Isaac said we need him to get back to work. I just have a couple of things I’d like to highlight. In his first term he implemented some important changes. I think having issues presented for discussion at one commission meeting and then decision-making at a second meeting has really helped the Commission and all affected stakeholders be able to engage in meaningful discussions without the fear of a contested case hearing hanging over everything. I also got to work closely with him on several issues. One example is our Native Hawaiian and environmental rights clinic supported the Wai‘oli Valley taro hui with challenges to restore their lo‘i kalo and mānowai. This was incredibly important work and incredibly complicated work and you folks know we were working side by side. I cannot say enough about how important Kaleo’s role was as a facilitator to bring together all the different entities, not just with Commission staff, Ayron and others, but also folks throughout DLNR and that was crucial in helping us leverage resources and to make meaningful changes not just with what happened before this Commission but also from a larger policy perspective so that other kalo farmers don’t have to have these issues. Others have also mentioned what an important bridge he’s been and now we can have meaningful two-way discussions not just one way directives. Kaleo has also had the courage to uphold the law and the Commissions processes and that has garnered some grousing, but I think as an attorney, I think that better protects this Commission and has reduced the number of appeals that we’ve seen during his term, at least compared to others. I can go on and on but suffice it to say I think you see I strongly support his reappointment and I want to urge all of you folks to vote in support. Thank you so much and I’m happy to take any questions.
I have had the privilege of meeting Kaleo as a young undergraduate at the University of Hawai‘i and throughout his graduate studies at UH Mānoa. He took several of my classes and he also joined halau. I’ve never been so proud of him over the past four years and watching him grow under DHHL. He led our PA'I board through an amazing planning process to develop our PA'I strategic plan and watching him facilitate those meetings and watching him in the community, I know that he has done such amazing work in the last four years with his team here. I thank the team here, his staff for the support that they give to Kaleo because a leader can only lead if you have people, and you have staff that strongly support the vision. The fact that he’s holding us all responsible not just the people at the Commission, but to the laws that were put into place to preserve our natural and cultural resources, and water is our most valuable resource. I know that he takes this very seriously and his kuleana to support and abide by and hold up the Water Commission standards and the laws of our ‘āina is going to be something that he takes very seriously, and he also knows that he must answer to his kumu. Thank you very much, I have such strong support for Kaleo. I have gotten to know him, and he is just going to be super for you.
Aloha I come from Lahaina, Maui. I am just testifying in strong support of Kaleo Manuel to be reappointed to his position as Deputy. Strong kāko‘o to all of the Commissioners of CWRM. We saw him in Lahaina quite a few times especially the past year. I think last spring was when he came out to facilitate a public meeting with all of us. I just really want to commend the awesome work that he did navigating the crowd that we had. He was informing us about the water designation in Lahaina and not pushing any kind of agenda on us but just showing reasons why designation was important and how it could only support the future of Lahaina and how it can help our community as well. Just wanted to quickly testify and show my kāko‘o as a community member of Lahaina for Kaleo Manuel.
I’m the secretary for the Wai‘oli Valley Taro Hui. Four generations of kalo farmers of Hawai‘i, our organization works in partnership with you and your staff, including Kaleo to amend the IIFS for Wai‘oli Stream in Spring 2021. Our testimony today is in strong support of agenda item B1 and I’m here on behalf of our hui of farmers to support Kaleo because he has supported us after a very long road starting with the 2018 flood. There were tons of applications, exemptions, studies, consultations, time at the Legislature and potential easements. Last year, Chair Case confirmed that we are pau with the water leasing process and can focus all of our efforts back to restoring our farm and we have life in Wai‘oli Valley. It took four years but it felt like a lifetime and we never would have gotten here without the help and support of Kaleo and Ayron. I’m not just talking about the IIFS. Kaleo was an important liaison with the Land Division and DLNR more generally. He was a bridge to ensure clear and transparent communication, a process that was completely confusing for us as kalo farmers. He even came to Wai‘oli to see firsthand the waters and other resources we were talking about and together with Ayron, was key regarding the installation of our gage so we can better monitor both streamflow and water use in our ‘auwais. This is a wonderful example of agency and community working together and this is just one example. I’m sure there are many more across Hawai‘i so please vote to confirm him.
I’m a Law Student at the William S. Richardson School of Law and given the overwhelming and powerful support already provided, I’ll keep this really short. I’m in strong support of B1 and I will stand on my written testimony. Also wanted to thank Kaleo and the Commission for the ability to testify via Zoom, which makes access to these meetings and information much more open to people who usually have to travel to Honolulu.
Aloha mai everybody. I’m here to testify in support of the reappointment of Deputy Director Manuel and just wanted to say we have had a lot of positive and very respectful lōkahi and engagement with Deputy Director Manuel. The Honokōhau Valley residents had the opportunity to hike up the valley to see the state of wai as we were renegotiating the IIFS and beginning the conversations in terms of the designation of West Maui. I think it speaks volumes when you have somebody in the Deputy Director’s position to come and walk with the community in their place to sort of really see what the historical impacts are and what other things like developments and other interests have on the ‘āina and on these resources. I would like to see at least one more term from a fellow kanaka and somebody who is truly dedicated to this resource, to our community, to our ‘ohana and hopefully his work and the work that we can do together as a lāhui will benefit the little ones like this and hopefully Deputy Director Manuel, if my boy here needs a job, I hope you can give him one. Mahalo. And I say this in full trust that you will do your best to mālama your kuleana to this next term to ensure the security and integrity of wai for all of us. Mahalo nui.
I want to support the picking of Kaleo for the position. I met him way back before he worked for the State, and he has always been honest and truthful which is in my experience somewhat rare in government these days. And even when it’s things I don’t want to hear, he tells it to me. I just want to say I support Kaleo and I hope you folks pick him. Thank you.
Aloha mai kākou. I often appear before you on behalf of various entities, but I am here today solely on my own behalf. Like Professor Sproat and Mr. Moriwake, I’m part of the folks who have been here for three decades. Not only was I here when Kaleo was last appointed, I was also here when the previous Deputy was appointed and the previous Deputy and at one point I was in that seat and the person before that. The thing I wanted to share other than to echo the long support that we’ve heard today for Kaleo is how different it is with respect to those who have come before Commissioners and Deputies. This has been a body that has been deeply hostile to local communities and Hawaiian communities. You have all these voices coming from across the pipeline saying hey, they recognize what you do, and we support what you do, we don’t always agree with what you do but we have a connection now. Not everybody has been happy during Kaleo’s time, but I think that’s also because it’s not that conflict didn’t exist before, but it was suppressed. Voices were suppressed, issues were suppressed, and we know what happens when that happens for too long. Bringing up a process where many entities now feel at least they have the opportunity to come before this really important board and have a fair hearing, will make our lives and Hawai‘i so much better. Mahalo nui.
I would like to just say mahalo to all of those who have provided written and oral testimony. It is very clear as Mr. Scheuer very aptly stated, things have changed, and it is nice to see these voices at the table. I appreciated reading through all the testimonies as they were individualized based upon a personal experience and I think that really matters. I appreciate everyone who took the time to submit testimony for our consideration, so thank you again.
I was so happy to hear that Kaleo was coming back. Incoming Chair if you had anything to do with that it was a very wise move. I’m so happy for the Water Commission because Kaleo has done an unbelievable job in managing the Water Commission. I am so happy for the State of Hawai‘i. We’ve heard a lot of descriptions of the last four years, we’ve had an opportunity, maybe for the first time to really implement the Water Code over large regional areas. I am so happy for the State of Hawai‘i that Kaleo is back. Finally, I am so happy for Kaleo himself. He is a unique individual with knowledge, skills and abilities and he has an opportunity to be in a position, which he has demonstrated, over the next four years to make a positive impact and those are experiences and memories that he will always cherish. I am incredibly happy for Kaleo and I am 100% in support of his reappointment.
Fist of all, I want to thank the testifiers who came forward, took time from your day to be here and be a part of the process and for all that you shared largely in support of Kaleo. I acknowledge the testimony of Charley Ice in opposition and appreciate Charley’s courage and status and stepping forward and stating his views. We’ve heard certainly a strong support from our Hawaiian community and grass roots of our supporters, of our culture and our environment. I also appreciated the testimony of Mike Atherton as a developer who is trying to restore agriculture and other uses in a balanced way, and I think that his testimony was key and an important element of support for your continuation in this position. When Kaleo first came into this position, I met with him in his office and we talk about this all the time, I saw this number on the whiteboard and it was the number of meetings he would have in his term of this Commission and a recognition that every one that passed without productive outcome was a lost opportunity. That is a profoundly important attribute of a public servant who is trying to work especially in this area where so much needs to be done for such a vital resource. That attitude was telltale, and it is one thing to want to get the work done and it is another thing to get the work done. The unprecedented results that we’ve seen in your submittal, Chair, as well as in other testimony, I think testifies to the fact that it’s not only a matter of wishing things can happen but an ability to make things happen. So appreciate that and I love Kevin’s comment that we provided an ear to people who didn’t feel like they had one before and we’ve provided opportunities to really kind of work out the differences so that we have a framework for how to move forward not only to protect the resource, not only to perpetuate the culture, but also to provide for development of agricultural and other urban uses in a way that’s very compatible with those goals and outcomes. That’s balance and I think it’s an important duty of this Commission. I think the team, not only Kaleo, but this team is doing a remarkable job in achieving that. I recognize that as a new administration steps in, there’s a desire to eagerly bring your team in and I appreciate that Governor Green has recognized that some members of the team that came before were really, valuable attributes and deserve recognition for what they’ve done in the past and are going to be valuable in his administration going forward in continuing progress and achieving greater results. For these reasons, I’ve seconded the motion and eagerly await not only the approval of this motion but also the months ahead. I think I have about a year and a half while we continue to work with the work we’ve done. Mahalo.
It’s with great relief that I heard Deputy Manuel was going to be reappointed. I’m the newest person on the Commission and it was a very eye-opening experience to realize how much of the work of this Commission really happens between the meetings. The Deputy and staff working together to really organize information and provide it to us so that we can make informed decisions. As testifier Kapua Sproat pointed out, the informational briefs that precede decision-making have been really helpful. The submittals are super dense so it’s helpful to have that lead time to wrap our brains around these complicated issues. I’ve had the opportunity to get out to East Maui to walk and really see the area that we are making decisions on. We can’t always go out there, it’s hard logistically with Sunshine Laws but it was facilitated by Deputy and staff. I’ve seen him and a lot of his staff take lead on different issues, Ayron Strauch on streams, Ryan Imata on Red Hill and really take the long view on many things. We’ve had conversations on capacity building, we all know that CWRM doesn’t have enough staff and wanting to do all that it should and wants to do, so how do we take the long view? That’s somebody not looking at a four-year term but really with a long-term kind of intergenerational interest in mind. Alongside with that we’ve had conversations about climate change, how do we better think about climate change in the context of our decision making and that played into the Lahaina Water Management Area Designation. I’m relieved that we can continue the work because these are challenging. As people have noted his facilitation skills are impressive and humbling. I don’t know how to learn those skills or how to create more people who have those skills who can really leverage them in public service. It’s not easy to be an agent of the State especially working in community where there’s been so much distress. I really respect the rapport he’s built especially as I was on the Red Hill permitted interaction group, I’ve seen what happens when we break trust with institutions and how harmful that is when really taking care of our waters. I appreciate the stamina that you bring, and you will find in the coming years. I’m looking forward and I fully support your nomination. I’m looking forward to continuing the important and complicated work ahead.
I think Kaleo’s accomplishments over his tenure as Deputy have been well documented and described by oral testimony as well as written testimony. I think this is an interesting and unique situation, could you provide some historical perspective? My first question is, I don’t think any agency in the State other than the Water Commission has a Deputy and Chair to be confirmed by two different bodies. How does the relationship work with the Chair being temporary and the Department Deputy being confirmed; should that not run in tandem? But let’s put that aside for a moment, I think it’s a very powerful situation that we have a resident Deputy that’s being nominated again and in reference to Mr. Ice’s testimony, has that been vetted to see if the internal mechanisms of the department have been working as intended? I don’t know if that was ever articulated in the narrative that was presented as well as the resume. All the big stuff for the future I agree with because I was there for most of it. But we do have a fiduciary responsibility to mandate things that we need to interface with the public in terms of well permits or other kinds of administrative things. I was wondering, has that been vetted? That’s sort of my big areas - do we need to talk about it a little more?
Aloha Commissioner Katayama, mahalo for the question. First of all, I want to say mahalo to the community for support of my nomination as well as the Commissioners and staff that are here. I think the question is tied to that in terms of internal management and staffmanagement and resources. I know what it is like to come in as staff as I used to work for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands as staff and the change in administration every four years and sometimes shorter if they don’t last, so continuity is really important. I will say in my defense, I’ve always come in working within the systems that have been created, but constantly asking questions about efficiency. How can we do things smarter with less resources, take advantage of opportunities when we see them? A lot of the internal dialogues that we have with staff, hopefully eventually some of them will talk with you one on one, or the freedom to do that, and I encourage staff to share their thoughts with me. We’ve constantly had great conversations, we don’t always agree but I’m always willing to listen to staff and look at ways that we can improve our systems. Some of the criticisms in Mr. Ice’s letter I was unaware of. I process permits, well construction and pump installation permits, as they are presented to me and I take every signature I put on a piece of paper very, very seriously. Most of my staff can attest to that as they probably get things sent back to them if there is even just a typo because I want it to be as perfect as it can be. That’s the type of person I am. The commitment to quality, that I’m committed to. I’ve worked with a supervisor and the supervisor would work with me, so we work through some of the issues especially related to well construction/pump installation permits that we’ve reviewed. Again, my commitment is just to be as good as I can, be an open door for staff to work with. As my kumu talked about in her running her halau, you as a leader are only as good as your team. I believe in every single one of my team members and the staff that are here today because I cannot lead without them. They really support me and I actually support them, I’ve uplifted them and a lot of the credit that has been given to me is actually credit that should be given to them because a lot of the initiatives and work that’s been presented, they’ve been worked on but have never gotten to the agenda or have never been prioritized. That’s my response to Commissioner Katayama’s question about a review and analyses of time frames. We were in the middle of a pandemic, I just want to highlight that. I got caught with that one so a lot of the time for review and processing were not only potentially stalled because of the pandemic, staff had retired, other agencies that have to do reviews for example, the Department of Health and State Historic Preservation Division (SHPD) also established new processes that we had to work through and navigate through. While some of the numbers may not line up, I do have data and statistics on permits processed, etc. through my four years. I think a lot of it was just situation based and timing.
Thank you Kaleo. I guess in going through this process, I believe my fiduciary responsibility is to cover all the bases. All the testimony in support was well deserved.
Mahalo and I appreciate the question and hopefully item C2 will also highlight some of the limits of our resources and the budget and staff that we do have.
I do have a concern and the concern really is that over many years, I worked on a lot of different teams and a lot of corporate and governmental positions and it’s absolutely critical for the effectiveness for the organizations to have the boss and the assistants to the boss and the Director, Deputy Directors or Deputies to be of one mind and be pulling in the same direction and that usually implies that folks have worked together for some time and they’ve had adequate time and effort devoted to conforming their goals and objectives for the organization and the mission. This is a situation where it appears to me, that we haven’t had that time, unfortunately and that’s the nature of the beast perhaps but we don’t even know for example, if the Chair’s position is final, if that’s correct. I’m concerned about that and this is something that should be discussed in executive session, but that’s a concern because the Chair and the Deputy should be able to finish each other’s sentences. They should have complete agreement, they should really conform the concepts of goals and directions and in a small organization, a relatively small organization like the Commission, that is a big task and shortfalls and budget and in staffing, that’s something that is critical. It’s critical to achieving the correct objectives for the people of Hawai‘i to filling our obligations under the Water Code and I’m just concerned that we haven’t had the time for that conformance and unity of goals and missions and thoughts to take place. I hope it doesn’t appear that there are difference of opinion or things don’t get done as efficiently as possible because that would be unfortunate and again, this is something that we should have talked about in executive session. I really think that we need to make use of that vehicle more often in situations like this. I admire Kaleo, I admire his work and he certainly has a lot of energy and I appreciate and admire that. Thank you very much.
I’ve only been sitting as Commissioner for 18 months and in that time, I’ve worked with Kaleo, I must say he has a lot of energy and positive energy. He is committed to the mission of the Commission and that is to protect and sustain our resources and our precious water, which I am also committed to. We have some disagreements, we’ve talked about them, and we will continue to work towards the betterment of our State. I am pleased that he has been nominated and fully support his nomination.
Thank you very much, Kathy, appreciate the comments. I just have a few comments. I appreciated both Mr. Katayama’s and Mr. Meyer’s comments. This is a historic moment for us, one that the Governor has had confidence in nominating me as the first Native Hawaiian woman, with a team with Laura Ka‘akua as the First Deputy and Kaleo Manuel as the Deputy for the Water Commission. I think it is a statement about the Governor’s commitment and his recognition of sensitivity to the Hawaiian community and that we do bring that to a department that touches and concerns every single person, whether you live here or whether you visit, but most particularly Native Hawaiians. You will find that I am a process person and there are people that are far smarter than me on substance, but I am a process person who believes in providing a safe venue and platform for genuine community engagement. I have appreciated the good work of Kaleo, as articulated by many of you who have provided testimony. Sometimes the pendulum swings a bit, and the pendulum has swung a bit where we are creating a platform for voices that historically have not been heard and it is those people who have probably been most affected by the decisions of the Water Commission and other agencies. Both in DLNR and at the Water Commission, it is my intention to create a space for those good conversations. I intend to use the Board of Land & Natural Resources as well as the Water Commission as a vehicle to hear community voices and concerns. We may not all have the same decision, but we are going to try very hard to create a place for those voices to be heard. Our first duty is to the mission of the Water Code. We’re not here to necessarily advocate, but it is to ensure that the Code is being upheld not only in the letter of the law but the spirit of the law. What was it intended to do with respect to my style of management. I say I am much too makule, too old, to micromanage but it is to provide the team, the staff with the tools for them to be successful whether it’s resources, capacity or funding but it is also to provide good input as we all make informed decisions. We are going to do a lot of internal coordination. To Mr. Meyer’s & Mr. Katayama’s comments, we’re going to speak very candidly within these walls, all the divisions will speak, and we have numerous divisions that don’t necessarily have the same mission, but when we leave DLNR we better have one voice but that means that we’re going to have a lot of hard discussions internally. Not everybody agrees with me, and I don’t agree with everybody, but we are going to create an environment where people can feel like they have the ability to say what they have to say and you’re right, I am not confirmed. I am here, I am the interim appointee, subject to Senate confirmation and I don’t know how that’s all going to go but during the time that I have here I am going to make the most of my time here sitting on both the Water Commission and DLNR. And like Kaleo, we come from similar values, and we share similar experiences and I think visions for the implementation of the Water Code. We may not all agree on how we get there but I think we want to get to the right place. I am optimistic that with the Water Commission as a collective body and the good guidance by staff, we will be able to continue the good work that’s already been instituted by the previous Commissioners and the Chairperson. I know that I have big shoes to fill with Suzanne Case but I will do the best that I can. I am extremely grateful that Kaleo has come back to return, that is the Governor’s decision to reappoint Kaleo but I think he has already heard a lot of the people in the community. Mahalo. I’m going to call for the motion that has been made by Commissioner Buck and seconded by Commissioner Hannahs, to approve the recommendation by the Chairperson to appoint Kaleo Manuel as the Deputy Director of the Water Commission, all in favor please say aye. Let’s take a roll call vote for this one to make sure we get it on the record, a unanimous vote. Ms. Yoda will you please do a roll call vote?
The motion has been made, seconded, and unanimously approved. Congratulations! Mahalo to all of those who are here today and those on Zoom and Kaleo for your willingness to serve another four years.
Mahalo. My white board is empty so I can put that number on the white board. I appreciate the confidence and again, thank you and mahalo for the support from the community that are here and online as well as staff, mahalo for all that you do and I look forward to another four years.
