and other public trust users and the general public is still an issue. We appreciate that the submittal raises the importance of public information and transparency, however the recommended action especially to the extent that expanded areas of delegation to the chair depend on notice in the water resource bulletin, I think Ryan also acknowledged maybe posting these applications online. That is a good solution, but I think other solutions for transparency can also be explored, as well. Delegation removes due process for the expanded areas for delegation, well construction permits, certain pump installation permits. This will remove due process for the Department and its beneficiaries in all instances except when we are the applicant. Cumulative impacts are not addressed. While exempting some small domestic wells can make sense, even in those cases the cumulative impacts of multiple wells should somehow be addressed. This could be significant adverse impact to the Department and other public trust uses of water. Efficiency is a worthy goal, but the submittal lacks some quantification of the problem and proposed solution. For instance, it could talk about how many of these permits come before staff each year over maybe the last 5 years and if this action were to be approved by the Commission, what the expectation on the time to process the permits. What is the difference in time, how much time do we hope to save by this. I don't think that was clearly communicated so I don't know the extent of the issue based on what was presented and whether or not this is an adequate solution to address the issue. The Department does suggest deferral of this matter until these issues would allow for further review and analysis by the Commission and its staff, however we understand that there are other differences of perspective and discussion among Commission as well as other public testimony. In the absence of a deferral, some of the Department's concerns could be addressed by modifying proposed action to add an ‘F’ to the A - E list of pump installation permits that are not delegated as follows. By adding an item F, pumps in aquifers where the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands has a water reservation, we would like to see added as one of the exceptions, should a deferral not happen today. Thank you again for the time to testify and if you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer.  

CHAIR CHANG: Thank you, Andrew. I appreciate your recommendation. You indicated that there may be other methods of notice. Did you have another suggestion?  

ANDREW CHOY: I think posting it online, posting it in the water bulletin, those are good first steps. I think other methods could be the environmental notice. I think that receives a greater deal of circulation availability. Posting it in the newspaper, public notice, taking out an ad in the Ka Wai Ola newsletter that OHA (Office of Hawaiian Affairs) produces, another form. I do think there are other ways to get the word out and be more transparent, but those are just some recommendations off the top of my head.  

CHAIR CHANG: Thank you very much for that.
