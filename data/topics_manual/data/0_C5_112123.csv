Update on Development and Implementation of Interim Instream Flow Standards in Southeast Kauaʻi
Dr. Ayron Strauch, CWRM Hydrologist
Staff gave an overview of the updated interim instream flow standards for Southeast Kauaʻi, including the process, timeline, and next steps.
Maybe it's just speculation and it's neither here nor there but, what was the logic for those initial boundaries?
It was set before my time, can’t tell you.
Were Commissioner Buck here, “so much water.” You look at these pictures as compared to Maui Komohana, you've got abundance, just a blessing of resource.
There's a lot of change happening in terms of ownership. All of these parcels are for sale so it's going to be very interesting so I think we really need to get our arms around how to manage these water systems.
I was just wondering if you wanted me to answer Commissioner Kagawa-Viviani’s question?
Dean, you are there. You were around.
I am here, been listening. The original hydrologic units were developed based on initially a 1990 Hawaii Stream Assessment Report that was created which just looked at the streams. We needed a way to code each of these areas that we're looking at and so I think in 1994 soon after that, the State developed watershed boundaries. These weren't so much for modeling purposes, was more just for a coding system. Between our data sets like Aquatic Resources and Office of Planning and us, we could have a common system that we would use and reference. Royce Jones who was one of the leading GIS folks in the state had developed these watershed boundaries that was further refined by NRCS and Pat Shade who used to work with NRCS and both US Geological Survey. Then we took those and again ours aren't intended for modeling, it's more for creating a system that we could identify an area and code. There are some areas in the State that are not as refined or need to be looked at more closely. As we do our work across the state we come across these areas and we may be fixing them as needed as Ayron is doing here. We actually have a full short report that outlines the whole process if you're interested.
Aloha, yes. Tara Rojas. I have a question and you know that's great for hearing this information but my question to you is last year, 2022, one of the water meetings. It was mentioned and it was like in tiny, tiny, tiny little letters on the minutes on the report that 3 million gallons will be lost per month. That it was unknown where and it had been going on for a long time, if not years. Is that still going on? Have you ever found the source of that 3 million gallon leak? That's my first question. My second question is as noticed the properties and everything up for sale, are you guys aware of just the overdevelopment and the issues currently going on and having the water there for future generations?
Tara, are you asking about Item C5?
Yeah, C5.
Do you have a specific location where you say the 3 million gallons?
No, it's been a long time but, I remember it was a 3-million-gallon leak that they said and I came and I testified and I asked questions and they said they didn't know where it was coming from and that it was very difficult to detect because apparently some of the places would run onto private property. That was an issue. Another thing was they said if the leak is happening in an area where there's sand and with sand you cannot see the leak, the water bubbling up or where there's a leak as well as on dirt. They were saying that and I went back and I asked but it's been going on for years so they hadn't found the source of the leak and that's three million gallons per month for years and upon years. Is it still happening?
I'm looking at Aaron across the table and I've asked him if he might know where you might be referencing and he's indicated no. Maybe if you could go back to your notes and identify the specific location, we can try to respond to that.
Well they could go into last year as well and look at the minutes and it's in really tiny letters under a table and it says 3-million-gallon leak.
You are the investigative reporter, Tara. I trust that you will find exactly where that may be in our minutes.
Ms. Susan Gordon-Chang presented testimony on a matter that did not pertain to Item C- 5.
Aloha nō. I just wanted to make one comment and that was to do with the Koloa parcel that was, I think it's now the Kauanoe o Kauaʻi new development. I do want to make a comment that in the EIS there were seven pūnāwai there that were capped off and I, me again Kiara Lorenzo Rodriguez for the record, as a wahine maoli it’s very important for us to ensure that we have this pūnāwai in case anything happens. If Covid has taught us anything it is that we need to be ready in times of need to be able to produce and harvest food for our people. These are concerns that have come across the board not only in the Kōloa ahupuaʻa but in all of Kauaʻi. So just keeping in consideration that we will do well not to waste this precious wai a Kāne, especially in one of what is to be said one of our most wet mokupuni, our most eldest. As the moʻopuna of this place it is our kuleana to ensure that our wai is taken care of. Ola i ka wai and happy makahiki season, mahalo piha.
