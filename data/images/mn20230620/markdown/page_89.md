decision and/or the diminished use of water for sugar have contributed to less withdrawal and more retainment?

**MR. IMATA:** So -- so it appears that Waipio mauka has actually -- the water level is rising, but we're also seeing a rise of the midpoint -- at the top of the transition zone and the midpoint of the transition zone, so, you know, that would suggest some -- some kind of -- I don't know. I mean, at this point, could that suggest some kind of depletion? I'm not really sure. Yeah, that's a great question.

I mean, we -- with respect to Waiāhole, we see development tunnels are quite -- still actively in use, and I believe that though the development tunnels are on the windward side, they do extend -- it appears that they may extend hydrologically possibly into the Waipahu-Waiawa Aquifer system. So whether the development tunnels are depleting recharge of Waipahu-Waiawa, that's a -- that's a great question. Although, you know, I think that -- you know, I'm trying to think of the timeline now. I'm trying to think of Waiāhole Ditch with respect to, you know, the pineapple fields on the Kunia side, and when things started actually transitioning over from -- the transition from sugar to pineapple and then pineapple to what's being seen in Kunia is -- you know, what we're seeing is diversified crops and some seed corn. I think seed corn is kind of diminishing.
