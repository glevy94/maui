perspective of the presence of contaminants in the aquifer. As far as aquifer health and depletion, that's really where -- again, as Kaleo mentioned, that's our sweet spot, right? So based on our increased monitoring of what's happening with respect to Waiawa Shaft and looking at our deep monitor well data, we are relatively confident that any changes in system pumpage isn't affecting the aquifers in a negative way.

COMMISSIONER HANNAHS: Okay, thank you. 

And second to Kaleo, the last -- I don't know if it was last month or the month before, the Navy made a presentation which really created an opportunity to kind of create a dashboard of various important task completions or objectives and milestones that we could track. Have we kind of done anything with that? Will we be seeing that on some routine basis, quarterly perhaps, or some --

DEPUTY MANUEL: I'm hoping to try to figure out whether it's some kind of informational briefing submittal that we have that we can kind of evaluate what we're seeing related to what they've presented or just have the Navy present on those three things every quarter. So they've agreed -- I've consistently reached out, and they agreed to be back in July to update us on those kind of three focal points of the work that they're doing. I'm hopeful that until the fuel is removed or the facility is closed, that they're committed -- at least we've gotten commitments from leadership
