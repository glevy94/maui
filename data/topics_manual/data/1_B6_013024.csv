PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Deputy Director Dean Uyeno Staff stated the summary request which is to approve SDWP.5083.6. QUESTIONS / COMMENTS
This is the contested case that ruined my eyes permanently. 
Well, we appreciate the sacrifice and the service.
I don’t hear Mark jumping in. This is Sean O’Keefe, director of Environmental Affairs for Alexander and Baldwin. I just wanted to highlight that the approvals that were previously obtained for the work on the category one diversions were for the O & M (operation and maintenance) work that has already been completed. By approvals I mean approvals by agencies other than this Commission and so we just wanted to again highlight the fact that if the additional work is approved by the Commission, then we’re going to have to go back to these other various agencies OCCL (Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands), the Clean Water Branch, Corps of Engineers. For a couple of diversions, the county with regard to SMA (Special Management Area) permitting and get separate approvals for the additional work. I don’t expect that to be especially complicated especially since they’ve got some familiarity with this project already, but it’s definitely boxes we need to tick before we can go out in the field and do the actual work. I don’t know if Mark, I stepped on your toes at all in jumping in but that is one point we wanted to make.
Aloha, sorry about that. I had to get some help, I’m not that smart when it comes to the computer. I heard Sean’s testimony and we’re prepared to work with the submittal to move forward with this, get this put behind us. I know this has taken forever and I’d just like to get this put behind us. We’re willing to do whatever we need to do to make sure this is taken care of.
I have a quick one because I wasn’t around in the earlier 2020 discussion. For those Commissioners who were and staff, those reasons for the reservations, have they all been addressed with this submittal? I see various comments for each of those diversions and so are those? It’s interesting that there’s no testimony so I’m kind of curious how those have been addressed and what’s changed?
Reservations meaning the Sierra Club’s comments and DOFAW?
What I meant is the reason that the Commission deferred action on the stream diversion permit application, have those all been addressed? This was a very site-specific submittal.
I believe so, we were just in the field actually yesterday with Sierra Club members in a related action. They mentioned to us that they’ll just be monitoring but I think we’ve addressed all of their concerns while still maintaining the viability of the system. For example, there are portions where the tunnel runs underneath the stream channel with the diversion just adjacent to it or above it. Working with EMI and Sean with Alexander and Baldwin, they’re willing to make those modifications without impact to the remaining system.
So those quarterly meetings are working?
This was a little outside of that meeting specifically. We had met specifically with DOFAW, DAR, and Sierra Club over the years.
Just out of curiosity I think early on there was some concern that if the flows in the ditch got too low it would affect the ditch walls and things like that. That hasn’t happened? I don’t know how much the flows have decreased.
We’ve decreased the flows significantly just to meet the irrigation demand on the farm and the Upcountry, particularly in the Wailoa Ditch and thus far we haven’t found any issue with that. Thank you for asking.
