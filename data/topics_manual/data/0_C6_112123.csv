Discussion with the Department of the Attorney General regarding the status of Keahi v. Chang, Civ. No. 1CCV-23-0001078. The Commission may go into Executive Session pursuant to Section 92-5(a)(4), Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes, in order to consult with its attorney on questions and issues pertaining to the Commission’s powers, duties, privileges, immunities, and liabilities.
Chair Chang, I had requested and it was listed as a last item. I’d like to know why it’s being moved up now?
This is to accommodate the Attorney General, her schedule. That she's physically here and she'll participate. She'll advise us in executive session, so that's why it’s been moved up.
Okay, the other thing is that if you go immediately to executive session, I'm going to object.
Okay and the objection is?
The objection is right now it is not clear whether the Attorney General represents the Commission. I know she represents you. Second of all, since we have taken opposing positions on the lawsuit she cannot represent both sides and so Attorney General has taken a public position which really is in compartment with yours and the Commission is in opposition. She cannot, according to the Hawaiʻi Supreme Court, represent us, the Commission.
Would you like to go into executive session with the attorney general to discuss that matter?
All I'm saying is that she is not our attorney right now. She is your attorney, she is not our attorney so I couldn’t see how we can go into executive session with our attorney if she is not our attorney.
Chair, I move that we go into executive session to discuss the matters regarding the status of Keahi v. Chang.
Just as a point of clarification, does the AG have a standing to make that motion or does a Commissioner have to make that motion? The motion to move into executive session.
The motion was the motion to move into exec... COMMISSIONER HO: I'm not, I made the motion.
Oh, you Kathy? You made the motion. I thought somebody on the Commission probably ought to make the motion.
I just have a question to Larry’s objection. Given the positioning on the agenda, you anticipate that there would have been people here present wishing to speak to that issue had we left it at the original spot?
No, the reason why I wanted it last was that I wanted to accommodate all the people here to testify because this may be a little long.
