## Minutes

**CHAIR CHANG:** Thank you very much, John. Dean, what is your schedule for this?

**DEPUTY UYENO:** We were hoping to start bringing at least these applications to you for Honokōwai later this year, the end of this year. That's the hope. We're starting to get the letters out now, most if not all of them should go out this week and again this is just for Honokōwai Aquifer. 30 days for them to get the information back to us at which point we can initiate the public review and public notice process.

**CHAIR CHANG:** There's also an opportunity for filing a contested case?

**DEPUTY UYENO:** Well, the public notice will go out. If there are objections, we'll have to hold a public hearing. I believe at that point during the public hearing process, people could request a contested case hearing or when it gets brought before the Commission, there’s another opportunity.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** Dean, if you think of it, reach out and let me know when those public hearings are and what the site are? I’d like to follow that along. Thanks very much.

**CHAIR CHANG:** That probably would be a good idea to have a Commission presence, too, since this is one of the first.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** I was just going to ask Mr. Helly, he mentioned the meeting that was upcoming, if he can share those details verbally with us.

**JOHN HELLY:** Just a moment, details of the schedule for the meeting?

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** Yeah, you said there was a meeting this week.

**JOHN HELLY:** Yes, there's a meeting on Thursday, our monthly board meeting at 1:30 in the afternoon and there's an agenda published and it's on the County website. You can look for the Board of Water Supply and that'll lead you hopefully to the agenda. If you require more, I'd be happy to send the link.

**20240618 03:27:55** – Commissioner Hannahs shares his closing remarks; he will be completing his tenure as Commissioner on June 30, 2024.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Chair Chang, mahalo for affording me this opportunity to share some parting thoughts as I approach the conclusion of two terms of service on this Commission. After reading transcripts of the minutes of our meetings over the past eight years and finding the record of my remarks to be far more disjointed than what I had in mind, I am submitting this written version of my manaʻo to supplement my oral comments.
