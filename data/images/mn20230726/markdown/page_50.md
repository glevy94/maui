We have data for courts or files, so the actual laboratory reports from the files shared in the library. We have data summary reports at the end of each period to be able to attempt to better explain the data that residents in the community are looking at, help them explain what that means to them and how it's relevant. We also have an interactive map which allows residents or business owners, or community members to look up an address and be able to see the data history from that specific location.

Some of the feedback we've heard specifically is to make things like school names easy to search so that a parent with a student in a school can easily look up that school name and identify what the safety of the water at their child's school is and things of that nature.

In addition to these efforts, we also wanted to continue to promote public outreach and community outreach. We've been setting up booths in places like the Naval Exchange facility in the lobby area, which is open to the public for people to interact with drinking water experts, look up their results, ask questions, and find out more information about the work we're doing. We are also working with our schools, hoping this fall to set up those similar booths at maybe some back-to-school events or open houses so that parents of students can help feel confidence.
