North Shore Water Company, LLC Request for Modification of Water Use Permits, Mokulēʻia 1 & 2 and Crowbar Ranch Wells (Well Nos. 3-3310-001, 3- 3310-002, 3-3410-001), TMK (1) 6-8-003:005 (Mokulēʻia 1 & 2), (1) 6-8-003:040 (Crowbar Ranch) Existing Water Use Permit Nos. 777 (Mokulēʻia 2) and 813 (Crowbar Ranch) Proposed Modified Water Use Permit No. 1088 Existing Use for 0.351 mgd; Mokulēʻia Ground Water Management Area, Oahu
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Ryan Imata, Ground Water Regulation Branch Chief Staff stated the summary of request in that the Commission approve the modifications and reduce allocation.
Is it typical to bundle multiple wells under a single permit? What are the criteria?
That’s a great question. A lot of times what happens is if wells are close together, we consider them to be batteries, but in the case of the Board of Water Supply, they might have a Wahiawa 1 one station and a Wahiawa 2 station that have their own independent allocations. I think in this case when they’re all tying into one end use and the end use is going to be reflective of that 0.351 total, they can pump from each well as they would need to. Another example would be the Navy system where they have Red Hill shaft, Waiawa shaft, and Halawa shaft. Each of those have their own allocation. In this case though because the end use is consistent and the wells are relatively close to each other, I think it’s more appropriate to give them one water use permit than giving them one for Mokuleʻia 1 and then one for Mokuleʻia 2.
Are there implications for, just looking at the map, there are a number of wells in the area. Can you talk us through - do you see any problems as pumping is shifted across those that we should be thinking about, or given the hydrogeology, is that not a concern?
I have to check, they will need to get pump installation permits and those will require pump tests.
From the submittal and the attachments and doing a little bit of my own background, it seems North Shore Water Company draws from other wells and those aren’t being discussed today. Maybe it’s outdated, a draft EA (Environmental Assessment), there was discussion of a few future potable wells to support that system. Is that factored in?
Not yet, they haven’t applied for them and I believe that 3310-001 and - 002 will meet the existing demands but the applicant is here to expand on that.
Exhibit 1, of the well locations, all of those are active wells?
Probably not. Whether they’re pumping or not, I’m not sure.
I guess my ultimate question is, in your analysis of the monthly pump usage for the two pumps, what is a sustainable yield from this aquifer relative...I know this is a small amount withdrawal, but just to put everything in perspective, how much headroom do we have in this aquifer?
That’s a good question, that’s why I like working from my computer. I can do this and blow up the map and see what the sustainable yield is. Mokuleʻia, Queenie, what’s the sustainable yield? I can pull it up on the website. Mokuleʻia has headroom, I’ll just say that. It does have headroom.
It’s pretty under-subscribed.
What I do remember is allocations that we issue are under sustainable yield and the total usage is...
I see the total usage is way under.
That’s just for the two wells, but if we’re talking about the entire aquifer...
Well, we want to put it in perspective from where we sit. I think the individual approval of this permit in context is okay, but again helping us put everything in context by aquifer is very helpful. We have all of these well permits, whether they’re active or not, but they all have allocations allowed to them.
I’ll apologize for that, I should have been clearer in that presentation. Typically, in a management area if I’m asking the Commission to approve an allocation, all 17 MGD, thanks Queenie, if I’m requesting the Commission approve an allocation, criteria number one is that there’s available resource. What I’ll do is I’ll inventory all of the existing allocations, I’ll inventory all of the DHHL (Department of Hawaiian Home Lands) if there is a DHHL reservation and other existing applications, just from an allocation standpoint what’s available. Then, we also provide a table showing the 12- month moving average of all of the wells in the area. Again, I apologize for not supplying that information here, but I thought that because it’s being reduced from 0.500 to 0.351 that that information wasn’t super pertinent. I will put it in next time.
Again, put everything in perspective relative to...from my point of view, this well change in pumpage should be ministerial, really. That’s okay.
That’s true and part of the reason why we presented this to you today was because it was the subject of a contested case hearing. I just wanted to make sure that the well was...
That has been extinguished because of the 72 parcel.
It was stayed. I think due process would allow the objector to still file for a contested case hearing based on the information that we provided today which...
Doesn’t appear so. I can’t say, but I don’t think so.
When Commissioner Meyer asked about, oh what are all the different wells, are they required to report to you to provide CWRM regularly?
All well users are required to report their monthly pumpage, chlorides, and generally non-pumping water levels, although we don’t get a lot of those.
Do you get regular reports from all of the wells?
I can’t remember what the percentage is in Mokuleʻia, but we have pretty good reporting percentages. In an effort to increase our reporting compliance, we had a project maybe four or five years ago. It was an outreach project. We hired a consultant to go out to all of the wells in management areas at first and teach them how to read their meters. We’ve increased the compliance for reporting quite significantly through that outreach program. We’re not 100% perfect but we also have an online system that people now log online to report their pumpage and their chlorides. It’s a pretty easy system and we’re constantly refining it and just trying to get perfect data.
What I realize is without good data, we have a difficult time making informed decisions. I’m also wondering, for those who aren’t complying, do we send them notices that they’re not in compliance and give them an opportunity to cure their non-compliance? Because I’m assuming that is part of their permit conditions.
If they don’t have a water use permit, they still have to report. The thing that we’ve been struggling with over the last couple years is compliance and an avenue to find people in violation. One thing that we’ve looked at is the CRV process through Bin to maybe take these very routine non-reporting things and just hand them off to that program to implement. The other thing is I’m kind of excited about reorganizing our branch to actually built in a compliance section because I know there’s been a lot of discussion from Commission and from the Leg for us to look at things like four-year non- use. I want to expand it beyond just reporting components and make sure that people are pumping in their allocations. We issue allocations, what good is it unless we enforce it. We’re not perfect, again we’re implementing projects to try to get those things done.
How do you cover those administrative costs for monitoring, requiring them to provide reports, monitoring updates and then inputting. Do you get that through general funds, do you have a source of funds? Because what I’m trying to get to is and maybe this is a rule amendment that we are charging an annual fee for all well permits.
We’ve talked about annual registration fees, too.
Annual registration fee so that we have a source of funds to help with that administrative cost of monitoring. I’m not in any way suggesting we’re going to do that here but I really do want us to look at that. Again, if we’re looking for good data we need to make sure you have the capacity to do that. The only way, we have to have a source of funds to do that. I would like us to look at whether that’s a rule amendment, whether we put that in because there’s a new water well permit that’s coming. I’d like us to look at that being a standard condition that we require not only a one-time fee for a new well but an annual registration fee. Whatever we call it, but some kind of an annual because I do think we need to share those costs. The fact that you come in late and we charge you a fee, everybody else who’s got a permit they should also share in those costs for us to get good information. A little diversion but I think administratively I’d like us to move in that direction. We’ve taken this particular agenda item as a good launching point for a lot of other issues, but I’ll bring it back to this particular agenda item.
I have one more question on that. I had trouble reading the end use of parcels because I couldn’t rotate this. I don’t have authority to rotate the screen and plus it’s blurry. Is that what’s there now? It looks like a perfect match of the quantity of the allocation that they seek to all of the uses that are there. And those are current uses?
Bob Strand represents them and can answer those questions.
So, they have adequate water for all the uses that are in place?
All of the existing uses, yes. This table in and of itself doesn’t show the exact calculation. They show the units and I guess that’s how it calculates out. For example, I’ll just use the first one. Single family duplex customer meters I think is 54. If you multiply that 54 by...exhibit 2. 
It’s super blurry. It’s unreadable.
I’ll just describe what it says. Basically, the table on the right-hand side, the box table, that’s the Department of Water Supply water system standards has an average daily demand for different types usage. They’ll identify on Oʻahu, it’s about 500 gallons per unit for a single-family residence. They have 54 customer meters and they multiplied that by 500 gallons per unit and came out with 27,000 gallons per day. Totaling all of those existing uses based on the duties that are described in the Department of Water Supply table, they came up with basically 0.351 MGD. I substantiated that with the graph that I showed on page 3 showing that they’re actually pumping 0.2.
According to the North Shore Water Use and Development Plan, it’s actually 8 MGD for sustainable yield for Mokuleʻia. I’m seeing different numbers. Since that question came up. But it’s under used, so it’s overallocated in terms of permits but the actual use is much lower than sustainable yield. We’ve got some things to think about. This is from Mokuleʻia Water Use and Development.
So, you’re seeing the total uses on Mokuleʻia Water Use and Development?
She’s saying the allocation is over.
The allocation is oversubscribed and it says on page 1-26 of Northshore Water Management Plan final, it says 8 MGD sustainable yield, water use permits issued 2010 is 8.025 but the water use in 2010, and that’s what’s been reported, is 0.175. Either we don’t have recording or we don’t have usage.
This is the Board of Water Supply plan.
This is on our website, WDPOA 2016 NS pdf on the planning branch’s website. Maybe for that broader context of Mokuleʻia, we have some things to think about but for this particular permit...
I believe based on our report from our database 17 MGD is the sustainable yield and allocation is 7.817.8 and 17 are very different. Is this an outdated document?
I don’t think Mokuleʻia has ever been 8. It’s always been around 17. This is from our website, it shows 17.
This is the County water use and development plan for the North Shore.
If that identifies the sustainable yield as 8 then that’s wrong. 
I’m looking at the numbers now.
This is a 2008 map. That’s a big difference!
We’ll have to look at that a little bit deeper, but yeah just based on my knowledge of the situation I knew that we weren’t over allocating water, plus they’re requesting a reduction.
It doesn’t have bearing but I personally have some homework to do to understand this aquifer sector area.
I can, too.
Bob Strand, I represent Dillingham Ranch and the North Shore Water Company. I don’t have much to add to Mr. Imata’s presentation, but I’m happy to answer any questions.
To that point that was just being made regarding the sustainable yield changing, I could just touch on that. It’s maybe not great for my arguments but just in the spirit of transparency. The sustainable yield was changed from the long-standing sustainable yield of 8 million gallons per day by the 2019 Water Resource Protection Plan. You can find more details about the issues regarding that in Protect Mokuleʻia Hui’s objections that were filed on May 25th of 2020 which kind of initiated this whole proceeding. The Water Resource Protection Plan changed assumptions. You have to read into multiple footnotes in the resource protection plan and then go to a different document that’s referred to in it to get to the fact that they changed the assumptions about how water was coming down gradient from the Wahiawa aquifers and going into the Mokuleʻia aquifers. Before they were doing it by linear distance of adjacent aquifer. The Mokuleʻia aquifer doesn’t have that much adjacent area to the Wahiawa aquifer whereas Waialua aquifer does. Then they now changed it to make it equal between the three aquifers under some new assumption which was not really well explained. At any rate the water resource protection plan of 2019 increased sustainable yield in Mokuleʻia from 8 to I believe 16 or 17 million gallons a day. My name is Mike Biechler. My house straddles the line of the Waialua and Mokuleʻia aquifers. I also have a small orchard, one acre farm in the Mokuleʻia aquifer and someday I anticipate that I may be sitting in front of you or going through this application process for a well on my farm, as well. We’ll see how that goes, but I’m also a staunch environmentalist and fiercely protective of the environment around the area where I live: the ocean, the water resources where I live, especially the nearshore ocean resources. That’s thoroughly detailed in our contested case and if it gets back to that point, we can address those issues more. That’s kind of how I come to sit before you today and I’m a representative not just of myself but I’m also the representative of the organization, an unaffiliated group named Protect Mokuleʻia Hui comprised of a number of people but six named representatives including myself that filed and were granted a contested case and are going through that process. Right before the hearing was about to happen, this amendment came through, this letter requesting to amend. I’ll start off by just explaining what my end request is and then maybe give you my reasons afterwards. My request is that the Commission defer action on this application to address the issues and gather more information. It seems like some of you have hit on some issues that maybe need some additional information and clarification before action can be taken. I do understand some of your inclinations that maybe this should be administrative because they’re actually requesting less water or something of that nature, but what they’re asking for does have serious effects on the aquifer and my position and Protect Mokuleʻia Hui’s position is that the contested case hearing is stayed, not extinguished. We’re not required to refile an application for a contested case hearing since this is an amendment to a stayed application subject to a contested case hearing. I think procedurally because of the way this came to be, we would not have to file an application for a new contested case hearing to continue disputing any issues that have arisen in this. As it may, if the board sees it otherwise I may just for good sakes demand a contested case hearing if that becomes necessary. I’ll reserve the right to that if that comes up. Getting to the merits of what’s actually presented here, I think one thing that needs to happen or needs to be clear if this is going to be approved is, what’s happening with these other permits? There’s a number of wells on the property, some of them have been capped and closed but some of them are open and have very large allocations. The Shop well for example, well number 3410-03, has an allocation of 1.5 million gallons per day and their own record in their EIS (Environmental Impact Statement) which is the most recent pumping data I’ve seen for it when they were going forward with this project, their EIS shows that they use 53,000 gallons a day but they have 1.5 million allocated. There is this four-year non-use provision and I for the life of me can’t figure out why this hasn’t been revoked. I do believe there’s a communication from the Commission to the Dillingham Ranch, Aina LLC the prior land owner, saying use it or lose it and I think they kind of got held up when they finally submitted this water use application. If this is getting resolved, I think the issue of these revocations or these other permits and allocations does need to be addressed as well because they have a 1.5 million allocation and they’re using 53,000. There’s clearly some stuff going on here. Maybe it would be better to part and parcel it all together especially since they’re asking for the Crowbar Ranch well to be put together with the upper-level wells 1 and 2. To the issue of where the water is going, I think there needs to be more specificity regarding the TMKs. The two documents I have, one is a chart or graph that was attached to their letter asking for a stay, the other is this thing that was attached as exhibit 4 to the staff submittal. Going to the exhibit four attached to the staff submittal, there’s one lot that’s curiously on there two different times, tax map parcel ending in -37. It’s account number 1 and 1a, that’s Mike Daily. I believe that is the lot immediately next to the polo fields and then at the end of the third page there’s also a lot named KN1 Kaena North LLC which I could not find that entity. Regardless the TMK is the same so it’s not clear what’s going on with that if that’s referring to the same two meters, if they’re double counting that customer because it appears that TMK already has two meters but it’s listed again there. My main concern with this list of TMKs that will be served with this is that it contains every single parcel in the Dillingham Ranch with like 2,600 acres or whatever. That it contains every single parcel when you see these DRA1 and DRA2. If you go to the chart that was attached with their original letter I believe it’s now exhibit two here, this has a little blue line at the top of it and the only water reference at all on this as going to something that could conceivably be on those parcels is equestrian. It says equestrian, 150 horses, 75 gallons per horse, that would be 11,250 gallons per day. All the other things, I guess there is a ranch office...I will try to summarize. I have a pending contested case, so I have what appears possibly as much knowledge as anyone on the topic here, but I appreciate your desire for brevity. There’s a lot of discrepancy between what’s listed on this letter that was attached to their request for a stay and the TMKs that they’ve presented. Basically, they haven’t done any effort to meet their burden to demonstrate that it’s reasonably beneficial or that they’re using it in the amount that’s needed. The records show they need it in 200,000 gallons per day, they’re asking for 350,000 gallons per day based on some spurious calculations. They are entitled to what’s reasonably beneficial and what’s necessary, not just whatever they want. I think they need to put that information, any information to meet their criteria in the application. The only place they provided any information that could conceivably meet their burden regarding the effects on existing uses, existing uses being nearshore water resources and Native Hawaiian cultural practices, which three of our Protect Mokuleʻia Hui members are claiming damage to their Native Hawaiian cultural practices. That needs to be described somewhere, that needs to be in the application. You need to be able to look at this information as the board deciding this thing and find out what are the likely effects of this on the nearshore water resources. They’ve only referred everyone to an EIS. It’s obsolete because it’s for a product that’s not happening, it’s 900 pages long with thousands of pages of appendixes and not even the most diligent person at the Water Commission has read that, I’m certain of it. It is a massive document and the references are scattered throughout and I don’t know how you could possibly think that you have the information regarding the effects of this on the nearshore surrounding uses. My last point I will make is regarding the bundling of these two wells. They’re not drawing water from the same place. The Crowbar Ranch is in the caprock, it’s down low. If you took everything that the applicant has said in their contested case hearing and all their filings together, they adamantly believe that that caprock where the Crowbar well is, is not connected to the aquifer where wells 1 and 2 are. Wells 1 and 2 are high level above 200 feet elevation, Crowbar Ranch is at 30 feet elevation or 25 feet elevation. They’ve maintained that the Wells 1 and 2 are an artisan aquifer that’s not connected in any way, against all logic and knowledge of how water works, not connected in any way to the other aquifer and it makes no discharges to the nearshore marine area. I adamantly disagree with that but that’s been the position they’ve espoused this whole time and so connecting them on one water use permit when they’re drawing from ostensibly separate aquifers and at much different manners and everything is a little bit nonsensical. I wouldn’t have any complaint or concern about considering Wells 1 and 2 a battery, they’re right next to each other, they’re at similar elevations, that makes sense. I think that is common I don’t think it makes sense to put Crowbar together with Wells 1 and 2. They’re extremely different and I do truly believe and we have documents that can show it, we’ve had Charlie Ice, I mean lots of people have said this over many years that there is subwater discharges into the nearshore marine area and the effects of that need to be considered. That’s the basis for our contested case hearing and is an issue that remains even if this is granted today. Again, my request is that you defer action on this amended application today to obtain more information, to get more clarity on the effects on the nearshore marine area, issues regarding the water usage and things of that nature that I’ve laid out. If in fact you don’t take that recommendation and you do decide to approve this, I truly believe that you need to make the revocation of other non-uses but existing allocations allocated to the applicant or on the property. Those need to be resolved here, they need to be subject to the revocation or modification of those permits. That’s actually what they said they would do in their EIS. They said that they would revoke all the other ones, give up all their other allocations if they got what they wanted and so hold them to that, please.
I think Mr. Biechler raises some interesting points and there’s a lot of discrepancy in the data, information we have, but sometimes a 100-mile journey begins with the first steps. I think having a return of some of the resource to clarify what’s going on with these wells and true them up, if you will, is a step in the right direction. It doesn’t solve all the problems and I think we need to get to those, but I can’t see where in terms of Ka Paʻakai or any other analysis that the reduction of, and we’re not even changing how much is being pumped. What’s being pumped is being pumped and that’s under the new amount let alone the former amount of the allocation. I don’t see the harm in taking that step and using that as the impetus for taking more steps to find out who’s doing what out there and to really true up the amount allocated to the uses that are permitted so we have a better understanding of what’s the gap between that and sustainable yield.
I’d like the record to reflect that we have Commissioner Larry Miike who has just joined us on Zoom.
I have a follow up comment and a request for staff, specifically Ryan. Maybe sometime in the next couple cycles, update us on those discrepancies on Mokuleʻia. I came in after those changes so the documents that are even on the Commission website, including that Board of Water Supply report don’t reflect the current status and we need to be able to articulate that we are making good decisions for the aquifer and show that we are doing our due diligence to consider public trust in these. I think we have homework, I don’t know if it’s an update on the aquifer, maybe in an informational briefing down the road I think could be helpful just so that we’re all on the same page.
I did find Mr. Biechler’s comment about the Crowbar Ranch well, it does seem to be a substantial distance. I can see Mokuleʻia 1 and 2 and given the fact that there’s a reduction I’m more comfortable, but is there a reason why that’s also being included? I know your comment was because it’s all being used for the same allocation. It is a substantial difference so if we’re looking at close location, a reason why Crowbar Ranch?
Normally when we issue an allocation, we’ll render the previous allocation superseded, one permit will supersede the other permit. In this case because the Mokuleʻia 1 and 2 Wells can’t be brought online tomorrow or even next week, they require PUC approval. From an inventory standpoint, I don’t want to have one allocation for Crowbar Ranch and then one allocation for Mokuleʻia 1 and 2 but it’s a chicken and egg thing because I think they have to go to PUC with the approval of the water use permit prior to getting approval from PUC.
Is that right?
That’s correct. Right now, the only well that’s operative is Crowbar Ranch well and it’s got issues and it doesn’t have enough water pressure for fire flow protection purposes. The long-term plan at the ranch was to drill the mauka wells which were drilled, cased, and capped and eventually when they are activated, which requires pumping and we have to get PUC approval for the expenditures and everything, the Crowbar Ranch well will no longer be used. Those two mauka wells, together with the reservoir that would be placed up there, would be the main source of water with one well being pumped at a time, the other one being a backup. They’d be operated in tandem or battery as Mr. Imata said and Crowbar Ranch well would still be there. I suppose if both wells went down we might use it but that would be a last resort because right now it’s doesn’t have water pressure sufficient for fire flow protection. The long-term plan is to put the two mauka wells online but as Mr. Imata said, it starts here. This is the first step, getting the water permit from the Commission then we have to go to the Public Utilities Commission, we have permits from the city and county, we have an easement from BLNR, so there’s a whole plan going forward. This is the first step to get approval, for these three wells eventually to be permitted, but with the mauka two wells replacing the Crowbar Ranch well [inaudible].
Assuming you get PUC approval for Mauka wells 1 and 2, will you resubmit your application to DPP for the 72 residents?
First of all, Dillingham Ranch ‘Aina sold the property. We have no plans to resubmit it. My understanding is the new owner doesn’t have any plans to resubmit it. They have I think seven large lots that they plan to do some housing, they could do maybe a couple of houses in each lot. Mostly it’s going to be maintained in agriculture there now at the 72-lot subdivision. The approval is all expired so nobody has any plans to re[inaudible].

MOTION: (HANNAHS / KATAYAMA) To move forward with further work that would clarify amount of water that is being utilized under permits that exist to reconcile the record.
I also heard the comments about effects on nearshore and in that clarification can you address what the Commission is doing to evaluate the potential effects on the nearshore? That might be a technical question. I don’t know what we’re already doing or if that’s going to be a new development, but at least come before us and help us understand how we evaluate potential nearshore impacts.
I would hope that that would have been discussed at the initial permit.
I would like a clarification. The amendments to me are independent of the permit application. Can we de-link them somehow and treat recommendations 1 and 2 as part of the permit and these other requests for staff as independent and not subject to getting the permits approved to move forward?
So, it’s now part of the record of the minutes.
I think rather than being amendments to the permit application, it should be a recommendation to staff that in future analysis and presentations that they comprehend this.
Thank you for the clarification. 
We’re going to decouple the...
Yes, the change in the allocation to the applicant is not conditioned upon anything [inaudible], it’s what’s set forth in the submittal, but as part of the record, in adopting this motion, we’d like staff to have...in future cases a better record upon which to make our decisions.
Can we withdraw that first motion and just restate it so that it’s absolutely clear?
MOTION WITHDRAWN (HANNAHS / KATAYAMA)
MOTION: (KATAYAMA / KAGAWA-VIVIANI) To approve staff recommendation as submitted.
*As a matter of record: Develop a plan for monitoring effects of changes and uses on nearshore resources.
UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED ( MIIKE/ KATAYAMA/ HANNAHS/ MEYER/KAGAWA-VIVIANI/HO)
