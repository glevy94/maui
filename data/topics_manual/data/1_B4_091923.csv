Approval of Surface Water Use Permit Application (SWUP.5934.6) for New Uses with Special Conditions, Michele Hoopii for 256,555 gpd; and Find that Amendment to SWUP.2157.6 issued to the Wailuku Water Company is Not Required; Waihe‘e Stream, Waihe‘e Surface Water Management Area, Maui, TMKs: (2) 3-2-018:027, 031, 032, 033
PRESENTATION OF SUBMITTAL: Dean Uyeno Staff stated the Surface Water Use Permit Application should be approved for new uses to Michele Hoʻopiʻi for kalo and diversified agriculture. They recognize appurtenant rights and that this use is considered under the priority for the exercise of traditional and cultural practices.
I would like to make an additional recommendation. I would like us in the future, when we’re asserting traditional customary practices, that we are making specific findings. If we can in the future, staff, specifically identify in the record the findings that make that traditional, customary practices. I would go to page 11. Michele Ho‘opi‘i, do you have anything you would like to add to this submittal?
Thank you, Chair Chang. Just wanted to add that my family does have a long history there in Wai‘ehu, Malaʻihi Road, specifically the area that we’re talking about, the Land Commission award is a little bit more in the cane field. As I have put it in my application, I am the sixth generational, lineal descendant of the original awardee, who was given the title for the property that I am requesting water for. I’d like to make it clear that I am not a customer. We are kuleana families that have been here for generations. We’ve had water coming to our property since then, since the Mahele. And because of the different water ways that were diverted and interrupted from the plantation era to present, we have since lost our water to the property, so that is why I’m here requesting my application be approved. Mahalo.
Our testimony is the same for item number B-4. We do not agree with the staff’s conclusion and we ask that you amend standard condition #3 to include the additional language that we have provided.
Thank you. Mr. Geiger or Mr. Codiga, would you like to add anything?
Nothing further. I’d be happy to answer any questions. The same arguments as we made previously for item B-3 would apply.
Nothing further, Chair.
I have Hōkūao. Would you like to provide comment?
Sure. Aloha again, Chair and Commissioners. Again, mahalo nui staff for their tremendous and detailed work on this particular applicant, the Hoʻopiʻis, who we know very well have long, lineal ties to the Wai‘ehu ahupua‘a. And just appreciate their patience and diligence and commitment to growing our ancestral crop, restoring their kuleana land, and again for the staff’s recommendations. Mahalo nui for your support. Thank you.
Is there anybody else in the room that would like to provide testimony on this? Dean, I would just add, making sure that we do add to the, if you’re going to add it to #2. Maybe we should just make a separate #4 and specifically if you could include the specific facts as found on page 11. “She’s a sixth generational lineal descendant of the original Mahele awardee and that her family has been continuously using the property and had the flow of water.” Perhaps you can just summarize. Alright with that being said, Commissioners do you have any questions or do I have a motion?
Chair, she also has appurtenant rights on this piece of property, correct?
And you do include that, right? 53
