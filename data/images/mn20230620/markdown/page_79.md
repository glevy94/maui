Does that answer your question?

COMMISSIONER BUCK: So the volume of the water would deflect any contaminants and stop its westward movement? Is that -- is that what I'm hearing?

MR. IMATA: Yeah, I mean --

MR. IMATA: I mean, you're -- in theory, I don't know if -- that it would deflect it, but it would suggest that there's a large quantity of water coming down from the Ko‘olaus -- and again, you know, the location of --

Let me back up a couple of slides. So the location of -- the location of Waimalu deep monitor well, it's -- you know, it's all the way over here. The facility is actually around here. Right? So --

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Yeah.

MR. IMATA: So, you know, there's this -- you know, one of the -- one of the thoughts that our geologists had was that because so much water is coming down and we see a thickening of the lens here, that it -- could that suggest
