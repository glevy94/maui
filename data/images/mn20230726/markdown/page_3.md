# P R O C E E D I N G S:

**CHAIR CHANG:** I think that's my cue. I'm pounding my table, pretending that it's the gavel. So I'm gonna call this meeting to order. Aloha mai kƒÅkou. My name is Dawn Chang, and I am the chair of the Commission on Water Resource Management. I apologize for not being -- not being there present, especially since this is the first meeting of our new commissioner, Larry Miike. This is the January 26, 2023, meeting of the Commission on Water Resource Management.

Oh, so sorry. I'm gonna turn my phone off. And it is 9:00 a.m. We are holding this meeting as a hybrid meeting. Some of us are in person in the Kalanimoku Building in the boardroom in Honolulu, and we are also holding this meeting remotely via Zoom, and can be watched live on YouTube.

For those here to testify on Zoom, we will let you into the meeting when we will be hearing the item you wish to testify on. Please remember to turn off your YouTube when you are in the main Zoom meeting room, or we will get an echo. When you enter, please be sure to keep your camera off and microphone muted until the commission calls on your public testimony. We ask that members of the public testifying on agenda items limit your testimony to three minutes so that we can get everyone. Please be mindful of everyone, those who are here to testify. And remember not to use the chat for any...
