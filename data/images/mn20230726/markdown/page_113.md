sustainable yield issue is that for this -- the things that -- the consequences that limit the availability of water from any particular aquifer is going to be different because -- depend on its hydrologic system. So, in this case -- let me get the pointer out so that -- so in the freshwater lenses, things like water table or the saltwater-freshwater interface or the depth of the transition zone will be very important. But, you know, when you look at things like dike-impounded groundwater and, you know, in -- on O‘ahu or Kaua‘i, or the thickly saturated aquifers, it's probably going to be streamflow because at some point, you know, as the managers of Hawai‘i's groundwater, someone will probably ask you, Well, can you limit the amount of streamflow reduction in -- you know, in my area? And that's going to become the limiting factor. It's not gonna be saltwater rise anymore. So then, you'll have to assess the availability of groundwater for dike-impounded areas based on that criterion. So also -- already changes, I think -- 

COMMISSIONER MIIKE: But that's not really my question. My question is that -- 

DR. IZUKA: Okay. 

COMMISSIONER MIIKE: -- I see that sometime in the future, even though there's resistance to it, is that you're gonna have to move water around. Like, for example, on the island of O‘ahu, you can't go by aquifer-specific use like
