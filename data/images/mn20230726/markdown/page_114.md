Now, for example, I know there's resistance on the Windward side to be able to transfer water to the Leeward side if they start getting short. So I'm more interested in not aquifer-specific water, but how would that affect the availability of water across the whole island? And in the practical consequence of your research, is it not gonna make any difference or do we have to worry about that in the future?

DR. IZUKA: I think the approach to assessing groundwater availability has to take into account these consequences. I guess I'm not understanding the question 'cause I thought that's what you were asking.

COMMISSIONER MIIKE: Well, let me simplify my question. How is your research gonna impact what we consider available sustainable yield? Is it not gonna have any consequence? Or if not, what is the purpose of your research?

DR. IZUKA: Oh, okay. So what I have shown, the research has shown that as managers, you're trying to determine the amount of water availability for human use, but there are also other uses that you are trying to balance them with, right? So in order to get to that answer, you have to consider things that are appropriate for those situations. For those settings, for the dike-impounded groundwater or freshwater.
