testimony, your comments?

**MS. PCOLA-DAVIS:** Yes. There's two points I want to make. The Navy believes reuse is outside the UST closure requirements and are not aware of other closed USTs that have been reused for nonfuel purposes. These are taken directly from my references. 

And the last one is during the FTAC, the DOH presented reduce, recycle, and reuse; neither the HRS 382.G nor the underground -- there's nothing saying that these tanks or that place has to be reduced, recycled, and reused. I just don't want this kind of information going out unless somebody can point me to exactly a document that says USTs must be reused. Mahalo.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Thank you very much, Susan. I've got next is -- is it Abbey Seitz? If you can unmute yourself? Are you here to testify on Item B1?

**DEPUTY MANUEL:** Chair, I think she's here for B3.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Okay, okay. Is there anybody else -- is it Franz?

**DEPUTY MANUEL:** On Item B3, Chair. Sorry, they're just --

**CHAIR CHANG:** Okay. No, very good. Is there anybody else that I'm missing, Kathy, online?

**MS. YODA:** No.
