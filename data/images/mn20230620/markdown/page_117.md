DEPUTY MANUEL: Yes. Item D-1 is just a chance for a farewell address from Commissioner Buck and just to --

CHAIR CHANG: Yes, yes.

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Super. And --

DEPUTY MANUEL: -- (inaudible).

COMMISSIONER BUCK: You know, informal. You guys got some formal written comments over there for the record, but I do have some other comments. It's the last time you'll hear me talk, at least on this side of the table.

I know many of you were here when Mr. Beamer gave his goodbye comments. I think he identified 41 different streams that we set in-stream flow standards during his tenure, which somewhat overlap, and so it had me thinking about, you know, why -- what's happened over the past eight years that we've been so productive? You know, a lot of our decisions were called historic and -- and surprising, and I think we've been really blessed 'cause the time was really ripe to have those decisions. Plantation agriculture was totally gone. We had lengthy contested cases that were ready to be resolved. We had a really diverse range of commissioners as well.

And so, I want to reflect a little bit on what did we learn over the past eight years and how might the commission improve how it works? So I came up -- the commission is more effective when we have time to work.
