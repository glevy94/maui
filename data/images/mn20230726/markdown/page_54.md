Shaft a single time under the UCMR5, the basically unregulated contaminates program under the EPA. And so we will collect another sample this fall, seven months after that sample, to verify that. We do not currently sample for PFAS within the distribution system just because of the sensitivity of that testing procedure and the risk of cross-contamination because PFAS is so prevalent in all sorts of things in our community, in popcorn packaging and Teflon pans and things like that. So we've prioritized those efforts on the sources; both the Navy Aiea Hālawā Shaft has been tested as well as the Waiāwa Shaft.

COMMISSIONER HO: I have a follow-up, then. So by that token, are you using EPA -- what is it? Method -- what methods are being used?

MS. MOODY: Sorry. So there are two separate method groups for PFAS. We -- for the Waiāwa Shaft and the Navy Aiea Hālawā Shaft, we use Method 537.1 and 533, which are the EPA drinking water methods. For other PFAS efforts that we've done in the area, such as following the AFFF release or at the Red Hill Shaft, we have used Method 1633, which is the method that's been identified for environmental sampling.
