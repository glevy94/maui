CHAIR CHANG: I'm putting on my DLNR hat. You know, your report just emphasized the disparate treatment. We ask -- I mean, here we are assuming that that golf course -- and we can let East Honolulu continue to take more water than the rest of the island, and we are not -- I mean, when I look at your Catalyst No. 1, that are -- that's all conservation, environmentalists, culture groups who are willing to put, you know -- I don't know who's funding all of this. I suspect they're all going out and getting private funds.

MR. USAGAWA: Yes.

CHAIR CHANG: They're getting federal funds. But I do not see a like -- a like response by your largest users, the swimming pool guys, the golf course guys. I mean -- but it just -- when I look at one end of the -- one end of the island, I look at -- I look at Leeward OÊ»ahu, everything is getting dumped over there, and those guys on the -- on the leeward side, they have a little bit of water for agricultural, which is sustainable. But on East Honolulu, we're paying for swimming pools and a golf course. I mean, I am sorry, I'm -- because I struggle with that at DLNR.
