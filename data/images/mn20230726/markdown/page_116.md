example, if we have the Pearl Harbor Aquifer at X amount of million gallons, as we take it down -- if we take it down further down, I assume that you're gonna already have to change the sustainable yield as you get closer to the maximum because you're having saltwater uprisings, etc., or decreased streamflow or no more watercress forming in Pearl City. So that was my question, is that what would you estimate the timeframe in which we start to have to consider reducing sustainable yields?

DR. IZUKA: Okay. That isn't -- again, the model is not capable of -- it's a steady-state model, so it doesn't have a time element in it, so it won't tell you how much longer you have. Models can be done -- can be created to do that, but these models were not and takes a lot more data than we had.

COMMISSIONER MIIKE: But if -- but if one of your -- one of your scenarios was increased withdrawals.

DR. IZUKA: Right.

COMMISSIONER MIIKE: So it seems to me that if that's one of your models and you could come up with an estimate, that would be a direct relationship to how much of a sustainable yield has to change, correct?

DR. IZUKA: It -- yeah. Well, it would -- it would tell you what the result -- it would tell you what the result of changing the pumping rate is, but it doesn't tell you.
