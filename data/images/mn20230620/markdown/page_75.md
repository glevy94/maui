their source -- the Waiawa Shaft is up here -- and primarily Waimalu and Moanalua where the Red Hill Tank Farm is located.

So, first of all, let's talk about our deep monitor well data. I'm going to show you the areas that -- the three deep monitor wells that I'm gonna sort of talk to you about with respect to what we're seeing in the aquifer.

First of all, there's the Waipio Mauka well. This is -- if you know the area, this is located on the road headed up to the Mililani Mortuary. This is located within the Waipahu-Waiawa Aquifer system area.

We have a Waimalu deep monitor well that's located within the Waimalu Aquifer system area, and we also have our Halawa deep monitor well, which is also actually located within Waimalu, and then this -- this boundary right here is the Moanalua Aquifer system.

So I want to show you -- this is a little bit of a blowup. So these are the Halawa and the Waimalu deep monitor well locations relative to some critical shafts. Right? So this is Halawa Shaft that the board operates, and this is -- this, as you know, has been shut down for quite a while. This is the Red Hill Shaft that the Navy operates. And so I just wanted to give you some -- some reference for the location of the Halawa deep monitor well and the Waimalu deep monitor well, and what this is -- what the data is telling us about the aquifer relative to the shafts.
