to recycled water systems if they're adjacent before we can -- before we issue the meter. So it's conditional to those types of uses.

Next.

In the uncertainties and contingencies, we describe what some of the -- you know, all the uncertainties that we could think of that have been affecting planning over the last couple of decades. Estimating and recovering sustainable yield is -- it's one -- you folks were talking about estimating sustainable yield; how do we recover that? And you can't recover it all in a lot of places. How does climate change and drought impacts affect recharge and sustainable yield, and what to do about it? Contamination, of course.

Groundwater-dependent ecosystems are brought up the last -- in the last administration, so we have a section on that.

Basically, sustainable yield is a percent of recharge. The remaining percent is allowed to flow to the ocean to support these ecosystems, and that -- you know, we had some strategies around that.

I know there's some interim in-stream flow standards, effects on stream flows, and protection and restoration there.

Drought impacts to stream flows and the diversions.
