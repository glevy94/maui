Approval of the Stream Diversion Works Permit (SDWP.6007.6) Application, Installation of a Portable Submersible Pump; and Find that a Petition to Amend the Interim Instream Flow Standard is Not Required; and Approval of Surface Water Use Permit (SWUP.6006.6) Application for New Use, With Special Conditions, Bob Flint and Sunny Jordan, 4,975 gpd for Diversified Agriculture, Irrigation and Domestic Use; Wailuku River, ‘Īao Surface Water Management Area, Maui, TMK: (2) 3-3-018:005
Dr. Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Acting Branch Chief Staff stated the summary of request to approve the Stream Diversion Works Permit based on domestic and agricultural use.
You said Priority 1, what's the basis for that? 
Let me tell you. Based upon the definition of traditional and customary rights?
I apologize, I did not write...
For the domestic use component of the 600 gpd (gallons per day).
Is that the traditional and customary?
No, it was for the domestic use component, the Priority 1.
What about the agriculture?
The diversified agricultural part, the domestic use component of 2,500 gpd for diversified ag and the 600...
So, it's not based on traditional and customary?
Then why is it in the submittal? It says that they have traditional and customary rights on the basis of the Commission in its past decision - said all of the Nā Wai ʻEhā area was traditional and that any Native Hawaiian qualifies which is a deviation from what the current law is. If you guys don't know?
I did not prepare this submittal, I apologize.
They're not claiming traditional and customary rights.
Why did you guys state that then? What was the purpose of saying they had traditional and customary rights?
No, they did not have traditional and customary rights. They claimed appurtenant rights, but those rights were extinguished.
That's another issue. I understand, well anyway, I saw in here somewhere that they were recognized on the basis that one of them was a Hawaiian and that the entire Nā Wai ʻEhā area was traditional and customary practices. My objection is that if that's the basis for giving this permit, I can't support that because what it's saying is that the entire Nā Wai ʻEhā area is traditional and customary practice, regardless of whether I had ever been there prior to 1892 -meaning my ancestors. As long as I'm native Hawaiian, I have traditional and customary rights. That is totally wrong. The other issue is that on the appurtenant rights, I continue to say that you can no longer extinguish it from 1978 and certainly from 1987. The Commission's decision back then says and I will quote, “The Commission has the duty to adhere to Reppun - the Reppun case - until the decision has been reversed or overruled by the court of last resort or altered by legislative enactment.” When I as the hearings officer dealt with this issue, I focused on the “or legislative enactment.” What the Commission did was simply eliminated from the decision, all of my discussion on legislative enactment and said that, oh we have to adhere to Reppun, otherwise we could be in trouble later on. I went into detail in my proposed Decision and Order on that in that the Reppun decision dealt with circumstances from ‘75 to ‘76 even though the decision was issued in 1980. The court has been clear that when they deal with this, they only deal with the issues at hand and they're not going to speculate about future issues. Regardless of that, in the first Waiāhole case in 2000, a couple of parties that objected that the ‘78 Constitutional amendments were not in effect until legislation was passed and the court said, nope. Once it was ratified, it's self-executing, so ‘78 where it preserved the appurtenant rights was established in 1978. Whether you agreed with that or not, in 1987 the Water Code was passed, reflecting their preservation of appurtenant rights. At least from 1987 on, you can't extinguish appurtenant rights and this reservation was made in 1990. My contention is appurtenant rights no longer can be extinguished because it has a statutory basis just as riparian rights can be extinguished because they have a statutory basis. Now, what to me is really strange is that the Commission’s decision said, oh we cannot until the Supreme Court tells us, we have to stick to Reppun, we have to adhere to case law. And yet, they turn around on the traditional and customary rights, they first say it was my recommendation as the hearings officer that a person had to personally trace their traditional and customary practice back before November 25, 1892 in a particular area. That wasn't my recommendation, that's the law. I was citing a case. What the Commission now says is that we deem all of Nā Wai ʻEhā as an area of traditional and customary practice and that any Hawaiian, whether or not they had ever resided in or their ancestors resided there, anybody. Urban Hawaiian living in Honolulu moves to Maui, they will have traditional and customary rights anywhere in Nā Wai ʻEhā. I can’t agree with that. I can approve this permit if it’s based on and with the priority of appurtenant rights, but not on traditional and customary rights. If the approval is based on neither of those and just because it's whatever the domestic use is, I'm fine with that, but I cannot go along with those two things.
If you look at page 22 of the submittal because traditional and customary rights is discussed, I wonder if that alleviates your concerns, page 22.
The applicant did not claim traditional and customary rights.
But in your discussion you qualify it by saying, “qualifying as a Native Hawaiian refers to those persons who are descendants of the Native Hawaiian who inhabited the island prior to...”
And also page 12, the applicant. They're not currently...
Maybe mine is different on the pdf.
Yeah, I don't think this is based upon traditional and customary practices, nor is it based on appurtenant rights. I think with that, Commissioner Miike...this is, and maybe I haven't been paying as close attention, first time I've notice Priority 1 and Priority 3 in your submittals. Are we now prioritizing?
Yeah, I don't think this is based upon traditional and customary practices, nor is it based on appurtenant rights. I think with that, Commissioner Miike...this is, and maybe I haven't been paying as close attention, first time I've notice Priority 1 and Priority 3 in your submittals. Are we now prioritizing?
That was a carryover from the Nā Wai ʻEhā decision, in the original Commission decision.
My understanding is that all of the permits that we will be issuing will have a priority ranking. That was in my proposal and that was in the Commission. Might have changed the priority a little bit, but there are priority rankings because we know there's not enough water for everybody is the point.
Whether that gets modified based upon the remand. 
The decision for this is based on domestic use? 
Which is Priority 1?
Correct.
Then as long as that discussion and that conclusion about appurtenant rights being extinguished and that changed definition of judicial and customary rights have no bearing on the permit, I'm fine with that. But, I'm just warning you that these cases come up and I know there are others coming up that claims, number one - appurtenant rights are extinguished, but more importantly changes radically the definition of traditional and customary rights. I'm going to object every time.
Okay, that's fair. I think in this particular permit, those were not the basis upon which staff is recommending the allocation. I share with you sentiments about the interpretation of traditional and customary practices. I believe you have to have a connection.
