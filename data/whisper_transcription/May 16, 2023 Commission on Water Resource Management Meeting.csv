"(1119.82, 1123.06)", for the implementation of the work needed to comply,1119.82,1123.06
"(1123.06, 1126.0)", with the Hualo Stream Interim Entry and Flow,1123.06,1126.0
"(1126.0, 1130.94)", Standards decisions made by the Commission in November of last year.,1126.0,1130.94
"(1130.94, 1136.12)", Let me first emphasize that EMI understands the importance of the Commission's decision,1130.94,1136.12
"(1136.12, 1142.24)", and recognizes the need to implement the IIFS decisions in a timely manner.,1136.12,1142.24
"(1142.24, 1145.58)", EMI has complied in this manner,1142.24,1145.58

"(1177.72, 1180.54)", some of the major policy issues.,1177.72,1180.54
"(1180.54, 1183.12)", The other comments in the written testimony,1180.54,1183.12
"(1183.12, 1187.2)", address some of the corrected stream names and TMK numbers.,1183.12,1187.2

"(1194.54, 1205.94)"," The permanent removal of diversions is not necessary to achieve compliance with the interim interim stream flow standards decision made by the Commission. By its very definition,",1194.54,1205.94
"(1205.94, 1213.06)", an interim interim flow standard is not permanent and can be changed in the future. While EMI,1205.94,1213.06
"(1213.06, 1218.6)", is completely in accord with the need to abandon the use of the diversions to comply with the,1213.06,1218.6

"(1246.96, 1253.2)", of Aquatic Resources has a policy that abandoned diversion should require the removal of the,1246.96,1253.2

"(1390.78, 1392.26)", so are you suggesting that the removal of the stream diversions triggers a chapter 343 review?,1390.78,1392.26
"(1398.82, 1416.78)"," I think that depends on what the commission decides. Not knowing what the commission may decide.

"(1441.38, 1443.24)", quite a large sum of money,1441.38,1443.24
"(1443.24, 1447.72)", to try to repair the ditch moving forward.,1443.24,1447.72

"(1505.0, 1513.0)", This is more a comment. This is from the actual words from our East Maui decision.,1505.0,1513.0
"(1513.0, 1518.0)", Our decision will necessitate significant reductions in off-stream diversions.,1513.0,1518.0
"(1518.0, 1523.0)", In many streams we are recommending no diversions of either base or total flow.,1518.0,1523.0

"(1525.28, 1527.92)"," the desired streamflow expected,",1525.28,1527.92
"(1527.92, 1531.52)", we recognize that a universal remedy to modify,1527.92,1531.52
"(1531.52, 1534.92)", or remove diversions is not practical.,1531.52,1534.92
"(1534.92, 1537.84)"," At this time, the commission overall guidance",1534.92,1537.84
"(1537.84, 1540.18)", is not to remove diversion instructions,1537.84,1540.18
"(1540.18, 1543.84)", if modifications can achieve desired results.,1540.18,1543.84
"(1543.84, 1545.84)", I just want to provide that for context for,1543.84,1545.84
"(1546.56, 1553.76)", subsequent discussions okay um neil your hand was up and then i'm going to take a look,1546.56,1553.76
"(1554.4, 1567.68)", and then paul as i look at the photos in the submittal i'm looking at some infrastructure that may not last forever uh and if we don't take,1554.4,1567.68
"(1567.68, 1576.14)", them out now remove them out now do they continue to uh deteriorate and really create and ultimately,1567.68,1576.14
"(1576.14, 1582.74)", the the use for which you're you're holding them in some at some unknown future date they're really,1576.14,1582.74
"(1582.74, 1586.48)", not they're really not prepared to to meet those needs,1582.74,1586.48
"(1587.04, 1594.88)", so i guess ken what i'm looking for is what's your rating of the life of this infrastructure,1587.04,1594.88
"(1594.88, 1605.4)", i mean it's it's served us well for a century uh how much more do you think it's gonna last? It just depends.,1594.88,1605.4
"(1605.4, 1607.96)"," Some is by age, some is by condition.",1605.4,1607.96
"(1609.54, 1613.22)"," I wouldn't say that there's a rating scale that we do have,",1609.54,1613.22
"(1613.22, 1616.12)"," but in working with the staff of the Water Commission,",1613.22,1616.12
"(1616.12, 1618.78)"," for example, there was a diversion",1616.12,1618.78
"(1618.78, 1621.48)"," where the staff recommended removal of pipes,",1618.78,1621.48
"(1621.48, 1626.72)", but not demolishing the dam or the embankment and um just to be frank,1621.48,1626.72
"(1626.72, 1631.28)", we're a little bit surprised and seeing the submittal that um it kind of changed and i think,1626.72,1631.28
"(1631.28, 1638.88)", you know further discussion is necessary um but um i would say that there are certain things like,1631.28,1638.88
"(1638.88, 1646.04)", removal of pipes would do less damage than actually going there with heavy equipment and trying to,1638.88,1646.04
"(1646.04, 1652.14)", hammer out that embankment where water can flow over it now.,1646.04,1652.14
"(1653.56, 1658.88)"," But on the other hand, in terms of your surprise, Ken, I mean, isn't it fairly standard in leases",1653.56,1658.88
"(1658.88, 1662.6)", that the improvements that you put up on the land during the term of your use,1658.88,1662.6
"(1662.6, 1665.36)", have to be removed when the when you return it,1662.6,1665.36
"(1666.08, 1672.96)", um it depends i i mean i'm not an expert on the land side but in billinar i've seen where the,1666.08,1672.96
"(1672.96, 1679.52)", land division has that option if the um if the lessee does not want to remove them improvements,1672.96,1679.52
"(1679.52, 1686.66)", that sometimes they they value their improvements and would like to keep it,1679.52,1686.66
"(1694.1, 1714.88)"," so Dean my I surmise that uh this is not the first time this discussion is being is occurring and that their feeling is that uh these have no use of future value or use for us um I mean it's hard to say, right? Depending on, again, as they did note in their comments that this is an interim flow standard.",1694.1,1714.88
"(1714.88, 1726.56)"," Understandably, I think we went through the same thing in the East Maui contest case hearing hearing where um do the should these as mr as commissioner buck noted uh should these",1714.88,1726.56
"(1726.56, 1734.08)", diversions be removed or not um i think you know that may have been an oversight on our part um,1726.56,1734.08
"(1734.08, 1739.68)", being that one submittal was for modification and one one submittal was was for diversion um,1734.08,1739.68
"(1740.48, 1748.16)", and noting a division of aquatic resources comments that about these about the two diversions,1740.48,1748.16
"(1749.36, 1760.22)", um let's see Dean maybe if I can jump in yep go ahead so I think um what would be helpful is uh,1749.36,1760.22
"(1760.22, 1765.6)", model can for the testimony but I think let's take them one at a time the first item is specifically,1760.22,1765.6
"(1765.6, 1771.68)", about modifications so in that the recommendations there is no recommendation for complete approval,1765.6,1771.68
"(1771.68, 1776.72)", unless i'm missing it so what his testimony is referring to is i don't need to and maybe we,1771.68,1776.72
"(1776.72, 1781.92)", should address b2 when we get there because it's con it's co-mingling the issues right now before,1776.72,1781.92
"(1781.92, 1785.2)", you our recommendations to modify which doesn't say,1781.92,1785.2
"(1785.2, 1790.48)", removal of the diversion it just is modified to meet the ifs so i think that would be helpful if,1785.2,1790.48
"(1790.48, 1797.2)", we just take them item by item because the issues that are raised in akinaka's or uh emi's testimony,1790.48,1797.2
"(1797.2, 1807.36)", is more reflective item b2 okay you would agree ken yes yes and thank you thank you for clarifying khalil okay very good very,1797.2,1807.36
"(1807.36, 1812.8)", good aurora did you want to did you have a question i'll hold it for b2 okay then let's,1807.36,1812.8
"(1812.8, 1832.7)"," go let's let's any questions on b1 um i am now going to open it for public comments. I do see there's a David Kimo Frankel and is Tiare Lawrence also on the call. So, Mr. Frankel, go ahead.",1812.8,1832.7
"(1835.92, 1841.26)"," Thank you. Good morning, David Frankel here on behalf of the Sierra Club. We submitted a written testimony.",1835.92,1841.26
"(1841.98, 1846.08)", And I'll try to isolate this to just be one and talk about b2 a,1841.98,1846.08
"(1846.08, 1855.2)", little later um you know we are concerned that we're not receiving information in a timely manner,1846.08,1855.2
"(1855.2, 1859.76)", and so i my understanding from the water commission's decision back in,1855.2,1859.76
"(1859.76, 1867.72)", november that emi has submitted to you you a timeline to implement other system modifications.,1859.76,1867.72
"(1867.72, 1873.78)"," We, I want to reiterate, we would like to see that. It's not posted on Sea Worm's website",1867.72,1873.78
"(1873.78, 1880.76)", and we would like to receive that so that we can provide you timely information early.,1873.78,1880.76
"(1880.76, 1898.04)"," One of the conditions that we would like to see that has been triggered by prior modifications that have been made is notification to residents on the day on which, prior to the day that it's occurring, that people are notified.",1880.76,1898.04
"(1898.04, 1906.88)"," So if people are going to be in a stream, they will know that a stream is going to be impounded and the water released.",1898.04,1906.88
"(1907.52, 1912.72)"," That is, it is a very dangerous situation that has occurred in the past. So we would like to have",1907.52,1912.72
"(1913.84, 1918.56)"," some sort of notification to residents, either mailing all the residents or putting a sign on",1913.84,1918.56
"(1918.56, 1923.92)"," the road, something so that people know when these modifications are being made. And that's",1918.56,1923.92
"(1923.92, 1926.06)", really important from just a public safety perspective.,1923.92,1926.06
"(1926.94, 1931.72)", Our second major concern has to do with the berms and lips that are suggested.,1926.94,1931.72
"(1934.62, 1947.52)"," When we talked to Aaron prior to the November Seaworm meeting, he told us that the modification to the grates was going to",1934.62,1947.52
"(1947.52, 1957.06)"," be that the metal sheet, whatever the word is, was going to be put on the grates at a slightly",1947.52,1957.06
"(1957.06, 1967.24)"," lower elevation. So the water would naturally flow there first rather than the higher up in the gates. But instead of doing that,",1957.06,1967.24
"(1967.42, 1972.46)"," AMI is proposing, I suppose, a cheaper solution, which is to put these berms in place. And we",1967.42,1972.46
"(1972.46, 1978.92)"," object to that for a couple of reasons. One, aesthetically, they're just ugly. Two, we don't",1972.46,1978.92
"(1978.92, 1989.0)"," think they're going to work effectively. Particularly, they're vulnerable when the high volumes of rain occur and water rushes down,",1978.92,1989.0
"(1989.0, 1997.0)", those berms are going to be knocked away and the mitigation ineffective.,1989.0,1997.0
"(1997.0, 2007.0)"," So we would like what Dr. Stroud discussed and proposed, and it's in our November testimony.",1997.0,2007.0
"(2007.0, 2010.0)"," We said we applauded that, and it gave us comfort.",2007.0,2010.0
"(2010.0, 2016.0)", But to see Emi completely changing course on this is is alarming.,2010.0,2016.0
"(2016.0, 2022.0)", Specifically specific concerns. whole lava stream which is depicted.,2016.0,2022.0
"(2022.0, 2025.52)", I think that's the first diversion depicted in the staff submittal,2022.0,2025.52
"(2025.52, 2035.12)", um the the um sluice gate hasn't been there since 2018 at least and that's five years and nobody,2025.52,2035.12
"(2035.68, 2042.72)", they if they're gonna put a slew skate back they need to have a uh apply for a permit and that's,2035.68,2042.72
"(2042.72, 2045.7)", apparently what they've done they They're shoehorning the,2042.72,2045.7
"(2045.7, 2053.0)", seaworms order to modify the structure to allow more water to go down to put in a new sluice gate.,2045.7,2053.0
"(2053.0, 2058.32)", That's completely not appropriate. That needs to be dealt with separately. The effect of putting,2053.0,2058.32
"(2058.32, 2067.06)", a sluice gate in would be to raise the amount of water that is essentially impounded before it can flow downstream.,2058.32,2067.06
"(2067.4, 2070.74)", That's the antithesis of what was in your folks' order.,2067.4,2070.74
"(2071.42, 2077.44)"," In addition, you folks need to know that the way it is now, with or without the sluice gate,",2071.42,2077.44
"(2077.98, 2080.8)"," poses a drowning hazard, a significant one.",2077.98,2080.8
"(2081.1, 2086.08)", Just upstream from there is a very nice well-used uh swimming hole and when,2081.1,2086.08
"(2086.08, 2094.24)", waters are high when they come up to sort of the top of the concrete dam what it would there's an,2086.08,2094.24
"(2094.24, 2101.28)", incredible current that's going to drag someone one day down through that hole underwater and,2094.24,2101.28
"(2101.84, 2111.08)", that should not um uh that that situation should not be there. That concrete lip or,2101.84,2111.08
"(2111.08, 2115.86)"," whatever you want to call it needs to be taken out so that there's a channel. Yeah, someone",2111.08,2115.86
"(2115.86, 2120.28)"," could be swept downstream, but at least it's not going to be swept completely underwater",2115.86,2120.28
"(2120.28, 2127.68)"," where they're going to, anyway, it's's a hazard needs to be fixed.",2120.28,2127.68
"(2129.12, 2133.8)", Let's see here.,2129.12,2133.8
"(2150.94, 2152.42)"," The photos that have been provided to you, I believe, did not come and things that need to be removed from the area.",2150.94,2152.42
"(2155.76, 2156.08)"," I'll just, you have a written testimony. I'll leave it at that.",2155.76,2156.08
"(2167.6, 2168.64)", It would help matters a lot if these kinds of issues were discussed in the quarterly meetings that are happening now um uh i don't know why this we had a,2167.6,2168.64
"(2174.8, 2185.0)", short time um for the last meeting but this kind of thing is exactly why we need the quarterly meeting so these issues can be hashed out before coming to you thank you thank you very much. Do we have any other public comment?,2174.8,2185.0
"(2185.0, 2190.0)"," Public test? Okay, no others commissioners.",2185.0,2190.0
"(2190.0, 2205.76)"," Okay, i'm sorry I just like to note for the record, and I just realized that that the Emi written testimony was mislabeled so actually b2 should actually be b1",2190.0,2205.76
"(2206.32, 2210.64)", and b1 should actually be b2 so i apologize i just realized it,2206.32,2210.64
"(2215.44, 2229.92)", okay commissioners aurora okay commissioner meyer uh yes chair thanks very much um a question please uh for emi um it sounds,2215.44,2229.92
"(2229.92, 2240.24)", like emi is ready to proceed with this work immediately and i saw in the in the uh submittals,2229.92,2240.24
"(2240.24, 2246.98)", that uh there was an estimate of about six months to have the majority of these things completed.,2240.24,2246.98
"(2246.98, 2248.38)"," Is that, does that still hold?",2246.98,2248.38
"(2248.38, 2251.44)"," That sounds pretty quick, which is just great",2248.38,2251.44
"(2251.44, 2253.96)"," because you get these in-stream flows,",2251.44,2253.96
"(2253.96, 2257.16)", interim in-stream flows up and running,2253.96,2257.16
"(2257.16, 2259.44)", and have this situation restored.,2257.16,2259.44
"(2260.42, 2263.2)"," But what is the timing right now,",2260.42,2263.2
"(2263.2, 2265.98)", assuming there are no further delays?,2263.2,2265.98
"(2272.6, 2272.82)"," Commissioner Meyer, I would have to defer to the actually EMI folks, and I think they're also available.",2272.6,2272.82
"(2287.2, 2287.76)"," But before that, maybe if I could just reiterate, it kind of depends on what the decision is and what times the permitting is um the the maybe the the thing that takes",2287.2,2287.76
"(2294.16, 2294.72)", but quite a while um but the actual work may not be that long but um we have mark vought also um,2294.16,2294.72
"(2299.2, 2300.08)", on the on the call so he could answer that question thank you ken i understand how the,2299.2,2300.08
"(2306.0, 2311.84)", scope and verbiage of the permits can affect the duration mark uh what do you think oh good morning chair chang yeah commissioners um yeah no i think the timeline we'd put for executing,2306.0,2311.84
"(2311.84, 2316.08)", the construction of this would be six months to a year i think that was what we had originally put,2311.84,2316.08
"(2316.08, 2323.36)", down um but the permitting you know permitting time and weather is always that's always the,2316.08,2323.36
"(2323.36, 2327.0)"," toss-up yeah um just depending about how soon we can get permits and weather is always, that's always the toss up, yeah. Just depending about how soon we can get permits",2323.36,2327.0
"(2327.0, 2329.0)"," and weather permitting, again,",2327.0,2329.0
"(2329.0, 2331.56)"," I think it's important to note that, you know,",2329.0,2331.56
"(2331.56, 2333.76)", those are obstructions to the construction.,2331.56,2333.76
"(2335.12, 2335.96)", Thank you.,2335.12,2335.96
"(2335.96, 2337.72)", I guess it's good we're heading into a drier season,2335.96,2337.72
"(2337.72, 2338.56)", at this point.,2337.72,2338.56
"(2339.96, 2340.8)", Aurora.,2339.96,2340.8
"(2340.8, 2341.64)", In terms of the work.,2340.8,2341.64
"(2341.64, 2344.84)", I have a question for Dr. Strzok,2341.64,2344.84
"(2344.84, 2346.76)", or stream protection and management.,2344.84,2346.76
"(2349.02, 2350.6)", It's a lot of technical information.,2349.02,2350.6
"(2350.6, 2352.56)"," I was wondering if a couple of things,",2350.6,2352.56
"(2352.56, 2354.88)", given the testimony from Sierra Club,2352.56,2354.88
"(2357.68, 2362.5)"," and some of the comments from East Maui,",2357.68,2362.5
"(2362.5, 2364.3)", when is the next meeting?,2362.5,2364.3
"(2364.3, 2366.0)", It sounds like this was not brought up,2364.3,2366.0
"(2366.0, 2369.12)", in the existing structures for dialogue.,2366.0,2369.12
"(2369.12, 2372.08)"," And I don't wanna, last thing I wanna do is like,",2369.12,2372.08
"(2372.08, 2374.08)", I've seen the diversions for three minutes.,2372.08,2374.08
"(2374.08, 2376.9)"," You know, we don't wanna be micromanaging it from Honolulu.",2374.08,2376.9
"(2376.9, 2381.5)", So like what happened last meeting,2376.9,2381.5
"(2381.5, 2384.48)", and when is the next opportunity,2381.5,2384.48
"(2384.48, 2386.24)", for hashing out some of these,2384.48,2386.24
"(2387.52, 2388.32)", understandings,2387.52,2388.32
"(2392.88, 2399.68)", i'm sorry i'm trying to i try to call the exact date of the last meeting but um you know i think,2392.88,2399.68
"(2399.68, 2405.44)", being our first meeting given that this responsibility to host these quarterly meetings transferred from,2399.68,2405.44
"(2405.44, 2412.56)", basically transferred from us to um from land division to to the commission um that this being,2405.44,2412.56
"(2412.56, 2418.64)", our first meeting was really kind of more just um getting to understand who um the players were and,2412.56,2418.64
"(2418.64, 2429.36)", and um you know um kind of getting updates from all the participating agencies and the general public.,2418.64,2429.36
"(2430.52, 2434.64)"," So, yeah, as I mentioned earlier, we sent out the acknowledgement letter on March 3rd to",2430.52,2434.64
"(2435.24, 2441.34)", East Maui Irrigation Company for the two diversions. We had the East Maui quarterly,2435.24,2441.34
"(2441.34, 2445.06)"," meeting two weeks later. So at that time, the applications were available",2441.34,2445.06
"(2445.06, 2447.04)", on our website and it was mentioned during the meeting,2445.06,2447.04
"(2447.04, 2452.04)", that the applications had been submitted.,2447.04,2452.04
"(2454.04, 2456.84)", So I apologize that it was an oversight on our part,2454.04,2456.84
"(2456.84, 2459.7)", that we didn't specifically go into the nature,2456.84,2459.7
"(2459.7, 2462.64)"," of the applications, but really that wasn't the focus",2459.7,2462.64
"(2462.64, 2463.6)", of the meeting at the time.,2462.64,2463.6
"(2463.6, 2468.82)", It was kind of just our first meeting and kind of an orientation to get to to know one another um in that space,2463.6,2468.82
"(2470.62, 2478.84)", so the next one um it so the plan right now is to hold it every three months so the next one is on,2470.62,2478.84
"(2478.84, 2487.76)"," June 15th June 16th current about 15th sorry sorry. And if it helps too, Erin does have some photos for each",2478.84,2487.76
"(2487.76, 2492.56)", of the diversions and can kind of walk through each of the proposed modifications for each one.,2487.76,2492.56
"(2493.92, 2502.4)"," You know, maybe given the feedback from testimony and my poor memory, it would be helpful to",2493.92,2502.4
"(2502.4, 2507.48)"," understand how the November decisions tie to the recommendations,",2502.4,2507.48
"(2507.92, 2512.58)"," you know, just the logical flow and to understand the rationales, because I think",2507.92,2512.58
"(2512.58, 2518.14)"," you've given a lot of thought to all of this and worked a lot and have spent a lot of time,",2512.58,2518.14
"(2518.14, 2523.06)"," but I think we just, we're not there with you. And I think the more everybody understands,",2518.14,2523.06
"(2523.2, 2525.44)", maybe the more people feel themselves,2523.2,2525.44
"(2525.44, 2533.84)", in the solution so um so let me um if i can call on dr ernstrock to um provide some photos and walk,2525.44,2533.84
"(2533.84, 2540.96)", through that um connections and and also just to note in the submittal um if you the logic we tried,2533.84,2540.96
"(2540.96, 2545.76)", to put the logic there above the diversion so it shows what was discussed in,2540.96,2545.76
"(2545.76, 2553.04)", november in the first box and then the proposed modification to show this is what we meant this,2545.76,2553.04
"(2553.04, 2557.6)", is what's being proposed if there is more crosswalking or further clarification then,2553.04,2557.6
"(2557.6, 2567.12)", let's go through that right let's take some time to walk through to make sure you feel comfortable with what's being recommended and acted on yeah,2557.6,2567.12
"(2573.36, 2579.12)", okay thank you uh dr kagawa viviani aaron struck with the stream protection and management branch i'm going to try my best to walk through the recommendations i was not the author of this,2573.36,2579.12
"(2579.12, 2590.68)", middle so i apologize for not knowing every detail of it. But I will start with H7 or Division 215 on Hau'alava Stream at Haiku Ditch.,2579.12,2590.68
"(2591.42, 2595.5)"," Hau'alava Stream, to give you a little bit of background,",2591.42,2595.5
"(2596.38, 2602.28)", the management goal was to increase flows in the stream to provide for recreational,2596.38,2602.28
"(2602.28, 2606.66)", riparian uses and downstream aquatic habitat.,2602.28,2606.66
"(2607.56, 2613.2)"," The stream has an estuary that increases recruitment to the lower reaches. However,",2607.56,2613.2
"(2613.2, 2625.76)", there are some substantial overhanging bedrock lips following the rejuvenation phase of the Hana Volcanics that flowed down slope.,2613.2,2625.76
"(2627.38, 2636.74)"," So at the Wailoa, New Hamakua, and Lowry ditches, we have made recommendations to increase",2627.38,2636.74
"(2637.34, 2648.88)", the base flow in the stream. And we would like that base flow to remain in the stream past the haiku ditch so at this location at,2637.34,2648.88
"(2648.88, 2657.88)", the haiku ditch the goal was not to discontinue the use of the diversion into the ditch but to,2648.88,2657.88
"(2657.88, 2665.92)", keep all of that flow that we've restored upstream in the stream to provide for those riparian recreational,2657.88,2665.92
"(2665.92, 2674.32)", and aquatic ecosystem values so in order to do that you have to understand how the diversion,2665.92,2674.32
"(2674.32, 2680.32)", was constructed the intake the ditch is in a tunnel underneath the stream and the intake,2674.32,2680.32
"(2680.32, 2689.78)", is on the right bank here and there is a gravel or a trash rack or right in front of it,2680.32,2689.78
"(2689.78, 2696.86)", which is this concrete wall and from a different angle right here the stream itself is dammed up,2689.78,2696.86
"(2696.86, 2728.34)"," and acts as the gravel trap to keep material out of the tunnel. The tunnel is difficult to maintain, and as much as possible, the design was to keep debris, whether it's rocks, sticks, leaves, you name it, out of the tunnel. the last five years as noted that would be lowered water would pool up behind this dam and then spill",2696.86,2728.34
"(2728.82, 2736.74)", into the intake through the pukas that are in this trash act so you can see all of these little,2728.82,2736.74
"(2736.74, 2745.16)"," tunnels or these little holes in order to keep all of that water that we've restored upstream in the stream, the goal",2736.74,2745.16
"(2745.16, 2756.48)", would is to lower the invert of this dam and seal these puccas so that the base flow remains,2745.16,2756.48
"(2756.48, 2760.5)", in the stream and goes downstream.,2756.48,2760.5
"(2760.5, 2791.4)"," If water were released via the sluice gate, then definitely there would be a potential hazard where people recreating in this pool might get trapped. design for all of the flow will that is restored to the stream will remain flowing through the notch that is proposed in the design here",2760.5,2791.4
"(2793.92, 2817.36)"," um the dam itself is built into the bridge you can see the bridge piers here and uh this watershed, the whole of a new tributary captures a decent amount of high flow events or big runoff events that that result in large flows through this section.",2793.92,2817.36
"(2817.36, 2823.2)", But all of the low flows will remain in the stream going through that notch.,2817.36,2823.2
"(2823.34, 2827.44)", Are there any questions so yeah on the submittal,2823.34,2827.44
"(2827.44, 2837.52)", it should be construct 45 inch wide by three inch okay it's just a typo there invert or notch sorry,2827.44,2837.52
"(2837.52, 2843.12)", it just the the submittal seems a little incomplete i guess in that or i'm not,2837.52,2843.12
"(2843.12, 2846.24)", understanding terminology so yeah Aaron if you,2843.12,2846.24
"(2846.24, 2854.32)", can refer to the submittal page proposed action action number four the yellow hatched lines is,2846.24,2854.32
"(2854.32, 2868.56)", what would be cut out of the wall to create that invert correct yes so that yellow hatching is the window with which all of the low flows will continue downstream.,2854.32,2868.56
"(2869.12, 2881.82)", So the lowest point in that window is the invert of the stream if we seal all of the pucas in the trash rack.,2869.12,2881.82
"(2882.92, 2883.32)", Got it.,2882.92,2883.32
"(2884.3, 2884.58)", Yeah.,2884.3,2884.58
"(2889.78, 2891.22)", It helps to have you walk us through yes a whole lot yeah,2889.78,2891.22
"(2898.78, 2905.44)", okay so Aaron has submitted having heard the concerns of Earth Justice and the rep uh and Ken on behalf on behalf of uh EMI you're satisfied that what we presented here in the in the submittal,2898.78,2905.44
"(2906.4, 2912.96)", uh is is still recommended notwithstanding the concerns that may have been raised correct,2906.4,2912.96
"(2913.76, 2929.84)", i believe that in order to retain all of the restored flow in the stream we need to notch out the dam and allow that flow downstream.,2913.76,2929.84
"(2929.84, 2936.28)", And this allows for EMI to divert some of those higher flow events.,2929.84,2936.28
"(2936.28, 2941.26)", But obviously they're never going to take a large portion of it because those high flow,2936.28,2941.26
"(2941.26, 2946.84)", events exceed the maximum capacity intake by 10 20 fold so it's,2941.26,2946.84
"(2946.84, 2953.98)", just the you know small portion of those high flow events will be able to be diverted and all,2946.84,2953.98
"(2953.98, 2959.02)", of those low flows will remain in the stream and and in this case we're allowing infrastructure,2953.98,2959.02
"(2959.02, 2970.72)", to remain in place and we're you we're adapting it to our multiple purposes yes thank you,2959.02,2970.72
"(2974.72, 2980.32)", aaron do you want to continue are we okay i think we should just walk through each of them so the commissioners know exactly what's being proposed but i do appreciate khalil the um,2974.72,2980.32
"(2981.68, 2988.96)", the presentation the logic yeah the logic so it does refer to the sea worm recommendation specifically,2981.68,2988.96
"(2988.96, 2994.16)", the november one and what was recommended and how this action is consistent so correct okay,2988.96,2994.16
"(2994.16, 2998.96)", yeah we want to make sure that we are in alignment with the orders the commission gave in november,2994.16,2998.96
"(2998.96, 3005.52)", and then if we're not then this is the time to actually make any modifications or recommendations. So we are consistent with that intent.,2998.96,3005.52
"(3006.06, 3006.22)", Okay.,3006.06,3006.22
"(3006.58, 3007.26)", Very good.,3006.58,3007.26
"(3007.62, 3007.86)", Okay.,3007.62,3007.86
"(3007.92, 3015.12)"," So this is Wailoa Intake 15 or Diversion 185, Kailua Stream at Wailoa Ditch.",3007.92,3015.12
"(3016.62, 3022.36)", I apologize for not reviewing EMI's drawings.,3016.62,3022.36
"(3022.94, 3026.0)"," Very clearly, I was more focused on the language.",3022.94,3026.0
"(3026.0, 3032.0)", But their drawings don't do what we were proposing justice.,3026.0,3032.0
"(3032.0, 3070.32)", They're a little bit crude to to say the least the the diversion itself is a great that captures all of the low flows and the goal was to create a a bridge or a put in a plate that retains the base flow across the intake and provides for downstream recreational usage and the mechanism proposed was um by me I believe was to put a metal,3032.0,3070.32
"(3070.32, 3080.52)", grate across it but I believe filling in the pucas with concrete and um rebar may also uh meet that,3070.32,3080.52
"(3080.52, 3088.76)", intent but the the need really is to create a little berm on the upstream side so that it,3080.52,3088.76
"(3088.76, 3095.7)"," ensures all those low flows continue across that bridge. Now, in the staff submittal, the berm is",3088.76,3095.7
"(3095.7, 3106.32)"," huge. And my recommendation was something along the lines of this is the bridge across the intake, and there's a little, I don't know if the bridge across the intake and there's a little,",3095.7,3106.32
"(3106.32, 3112.08)"," I don't know if you can see that, but there's a little lip here. In other locations, just a little",3106.32,3112.08
"(3112.08, 3117.68)"," bit, you know, two or three inches of concrete would work and it would get the water, this is",3112.08,3117.68
"(3117.68, 3131.14)"," before the concrete's poured, but it would get the water flowing over the intake downstream. So again, I apologize. The staff submittal doesn't do the",3117.68,3131.14
"(3131.14, 3142.68)"," design justice, but very little concrete would be used and it would not impede the visual aesthetics,",3131.14,3142.68
"(3142.68, 3146.0)"," in my opinion, and it would would withstand.",3142.68,3146.0
"(3146.0, 3172.88)"," We've seen these you know concrete over tens of years is gonna get damaged, but it would withstand damage,, a few inches at most berm to make sure all of those low flows continue across the intake downstream.",3146.0,3172.88
"(3173.6, 3181.36)"," So Aaron, real quick, just before we continue, the proposed modifications is a three inch by 30 inch wide metal plate.",3173.6,3181.36
"(3181.66, 3185.04)", So would you recommend that the berms also be three inches high,3181.66,3185.04
"(3186.0, 3192.32)", so we can just add that clarification language install three inch berms as long as it meets the,3186.0,3192.32
"(3192.32, 3200.0)", intent of um the amount of water flowing downstream i mean there's you the amount of,3192.32,3200.0
"(3200.0, 3205.12)", water that the plate can carry is dependent on how wide it is how wide the channel is at that point,3200.0,3205.12
"(3206.24, 3214.96)", i mean i'm confident they have the engineers to do the design um i you know they as long as the,3206.24,3214.96
"(3214.96, 3231.2)", interim and stream flow standard is met by the design and we can verify that in the field so okay aaron those those grates look like they've been there a while um,3214.96,3231.2
"(3232.8, 3238.16)", do they factor into any of our our uh goals or objectives for that stream,3232.8,3238.16
"(3242.4, 3245.68)", i i don't understand that question.,3242.4,3245.68
"(3251.08, 3251.36)", I get where low flow is going to go through that.,3251.08,3251.36
"(3254.96, 3255.6)"," We're creating a system where the low flow will stay in the stream, which is an objective.",3254.96,3255.6
"(3263.08, 3264.08)"," But during high flow, those big grates like that, pretty much everything dumps into the diversion then, right?",3263.08,3264.08
"(3266.14, 3273.86)", A portion of it i mean the when you get the flows that so kailua watershed goes up i don't know eight seven thousand feet,3266.14,3273.86
"(3273.86, 3280.7)", in elevation maximum elevation some are some are pretty substantial up on haleakala there are some,3273.86,3280.7
"(3280.7, 3286.24)", big storm events that flow through this stream channel and in no way does this intake,3280.7,3286.24
"(3286.24, 3293.92)", capture um much of those high flow events uh but you know it will capture those medium flow events,3286.24,3293.92
"(3294.7, 3308.38)", um so is that well yeah yeah I I I think you've addressed the point that I raised. I didn't quite raise all the point as well as I wanted to.,3294.7,3308.38
"(3309.5, 3311.18)", That doesn't look like best practice.,3309.5,3311.18
"(3311.44, 3314.04)", It doesn't look like the kind of stuff we want in our stream long term.,3311.44,3314.04
"(3314.22, 3323.8)", Aren't there better grading systems now that allow water to flow over as well as into diversions and so forth?,3314.22,3323.8
"(3323.8, 3329.84)", And this stuff is just going to break apart over time as it continues to deteriorate is this the moment,3323.8,3329.84
"(3329.84, 3336.88)", that we use to see an upgrade of that or is that irrelevant to the purposes of the action,3329.84,3336.88
"(3336.88, 3348.48)", the question whether this current design is going to deteriorate over time i i can refer to emi in terms of the age which or the the longevity of,3336.88,3348.48
"(3348.48, 3355.76)", the the structure i don't know when this was last replaced um but i would assume decades if not,3348.48,3355.76
"(3356.56, 3371.4)"," many decades um maybe emi can comment on the age of which these structures are at at this point. Yeah, I apologize, but I don't know the exact age of these, but they are long before",3356.56,3371.4
"(3371.4, 3375.24)"," I started, which was roughly 30 years ago.",3371.4,3375.24
"(3375.24, 3390.0)"," And I know that these are, you know, 50 plus years old, if not more. So our recommendation would just leave them as is at this point.",3375.24,3390.0
"(3390.0, 3394.0)", The the structure outside of the low flow channel.,3390.0,3394.0
"(3394.0, 3399.0)"," I believe, yeah, Emi repairs as needed.",3394.0,3399.0
"(3399.0, 3410.58)"," We don't micromanage repairs like this. So the feeling is it's a bit of an overreach for the, our, the in stream flows standard",3399.0,3410.58
"(3410.58, 3417.24)", which is kind of the focus of our action to kind of leverage some improvements here that,3410.58,3417.24
"(3417.24, 3425.0)", would make this a more modern system.,3417.24,3425.0
"(3428.0, 3441.0)"," I don't know what you mean by modern. The this intake in particular has a control mechanism, if i'm correct mark that when the why low a ditch flows exceed a certain capacity.",3428.0,3441.0
"(3441.0, 3449.0)", It automatically closes a radial gate that discharges the water into the new Hamakua ditch.,3441.0,3449.0
"(3449.0, 3466.0)"," So it's it's a pretty cool design I don't Okay, thank you, Chair.",3449.0,3466.0
"(3466.0, 3478.0)"," Okay, I will go to so oh, pool a stream at Spreckles ditch.",3466.0,3478.0
"(3478.0, 3492.2)", The may refer to the submittal the this the photograph in the submittal is a little misleading and the location of the,3478.0,3492.2
"(3492.2, 3498.78)", concrete lip is on the wrong side. This is a downstream view looking at the intake.,3492.2,3498.78
"(3499.88, 3511.0)"," This is the right bank. Left bank is covered in how bush, as you can see, there are these small little wing walls, and there's a great in where water drops through.",3499.88,3511.0
"(3511.34, 3513.62)", This is looking upstream.,3511.34,3513.62
"(3513.72, 3528.1)", This is looking from the rightverted at the Spreckels ditch,3513.72,3528.1
"(3528.1, 3537.16)", intake so in order to do that we need to somehow bridge this grate and that was envisioned to be,3528.1,3537.16
"(3537.16, 3547.92)", similar to the Kailua ditch in that a some sort of metal plate or sealant would go across the intake to transport all of those low flows and therefore,3537.16,3547.92
"(3547.92, 3555.12)", some sort of little berm on the upstream lip to get all of that water across the whole,3547.92,3555.12
"(3555.12, 3571.1)"," structure at all. These wing walls, they've been around for many decades, I would presume, and small concrete structures will last in this environment if they're designed appropriately.",3555.12,3571.1
"(3571.7, 3591.0)"," So that is the goal of this stream management wise was to increase the availability of aquatic habitat downstream, specifically downstream of the center ditch, but also downstream of the speckles ditch to increase habitat availability.",3571.7,3591.0
"(3591.0, 3600.0)"," So, Aaron, just real quick, based on the recommended proposed action in the submittal.",3591.0,3600.0
"(3600.0, 3610.16)", Is there any language that needs to be amended based on your review or is that sufficient it says construct,3600.0,3610.16
"(3610.16, 3617.3)", three inch high 30 by 30 inch wide concrete metal plate channel across gray to pass 1.8 cfs,3610.16,3617.3
"(3617.3, 3628.34)", um i think the three inch high refers to the the sides not necessarily the height of the plate itself maybe that's a um uh um uh,3617.3,3628.34
"(3628.94, 3637.64)", oversight um and then in install a concrete lip across upstream sided diversion and you know the,3628.94,3637.64
"(3638.72, 3645.44)", the on page six of the submittal the photograph and and location of the lip is incorrect,3638.72,3645.44
"(3647.68, 3653.84)", but the language is correct it is still upstream where the berm is yes yes and the plate will,3647.68,3653.84
"(3653.84, 3659.12)", accomplish the goal of connectivity and habitat restoration yes okay,3653.84,3659.12
"(3663.04, 3666.6)", um sorry where are we well,3663.04,3666.6
"(3670.56, 3674.4)", well wait Wayne katsuyama did you have a question your hand is up,3670.56,3674.4
"(3677.94, 3687.2)", oh thank you chair this is for I have two questions really one for mark and one for ken uh mark could you address the,3677.94,3687.2
"(3687.2, 3699.2)", some of the safety issues that was raised by the sierra club uh in terms of uh notification of work,3687.2,3699.2
"(3699.2, 3710.64)", uh i think aaron addressed the uh siphoningoning effect in the damming of the one diversion.,3699.2,3710.64
"(3710.82, 3716.08)"," But Mark, could you address the safety precautions that will be in place?",3710.82,3716.08
"(3717.22, 3723.68)"," So if notification to downstream residents, you know, I'm sure we can work out something,",3717.22,3723.68
"(3723.68, 3731.0)", some sort of notification with a point of contact with the downstream residents of each particular stream.,3723.68,3731.0
"(3731.0, 3747.0)"," But the sudden release of an impoundment that would cause that, that, you know, we've gone over this before, and that's not something if if there's enough water in there impounded that we release it.",3731.0,3747.0
"(3747.0, 3750.0)", That would put our employees in jeopardy that would put everyone in jeopardy.,3747.0,3750.0
"(3750.0, 3754.0)", So that's just that we we just don't plan to work in those conditions.,3750.0,3754.0
"(3754.0, 3757.0)"," If the water is that high, we don't have to work in those conditions.",3754.0,3757.0
"(3757.0, 3772.24)", I respect the Sierra Club mentioning that just saying that we we wouldn't want to put ourselves in jeopardy as well as anyone else so those are precautions we would take okay thank you mark um the second is really a clarification,3757.0,3772.24
"(3772.24, 3783.52)", on the intent of the designs of the berms that was mentioned what is the structural integrity,3772.24,3783.52
"(3783.52, 3787.52)", that's built into these designs that was engineered into these,3783.52,3787.52
"(3787.52, 3799.2)", submittals um commissioner kateyama is the question for me either you or mark i mean you know,3787.52,3799.2
"(3799.2, 3805.36)", you're planning on having these structures withstand a certain flow over a period of time.,3799.2,3805.36
"(3806.7, 3811.92)"," So as you went through the engineering specs for the berms and the grates,",3806.7,3811.92
"(3812.1, 3814.8)", what was the design criteria that was used?,3812.1,3814.8
"(3815.34, 3817.74)"," So I do want to clarify something that, you know,",3815.34,3817.74
"(3817.8, 3821.26)"," when we talked with Akinaka and they were coming up with the criteria,",3817.8,3821.26
"(3821.86, 3824.58)", one of the things was the actual channel size.,3821.86,3824.58
"(3824.78, 3828.58)"," And if the channel size is, you know,",3824.78,3828.58
"(3828.58, 3831.46)"," if the channel size is 30 inches by three inches high,",3828.58,3831.46
"(3831.46, 3833.16)", that's the entire height of the berm.,3831.46,3833.16
"(3833.16, 3834.96)"," It's not something that we would put something,",3833.16,3834.96
"(3834.96, 3837.28)"," you know, largely intrusive in there, you know,",3834.96,3837.28
"(3837.28, 3838.68)", as far as a berm is concerned.,3837.28,3838.68
"(3838.68, 3841.32)"," It's just to basically, the word I'm gonna use",3838.68,3841.32
"(3841.32, 3844.74)", is to channelize the water into a certain location,3841.32,3844.74
"(3844.74, 3846.5)", so that it can bypass the intake.,3844.74,3846.5
"(3846.5, 3849.38)", Any flows that are consistently higher than that,3846.5,3849.38
"(3849.38, 3852.62)", would have access to the breach themselves and the intake.,3849.38,3852.62
"(3852.62, 3856.5)"," But other than that, anything at a low flow,",3852.62,3856.5
"(3856.5, 3858.98)", in a low flow situation is gonna be channeled,3856.5,3858.98
"(3858.98, 3862.22)", into the bypass channel and run the extreme.,3858.98,3862.22
"(3862.22, 3865.78)", And I think the berms are designed to be just the same height as the,3862.22,3865.78
"(3865.78, 3877.28)", channel itself and that has withstood high fly high flow events over time thus far yes we've,3865.78,3877.28
"(3877.28, 3885.76)", had situations like that we've used metal in the past and they have but i mean mother nature changes her mind you know daily and you know,3877.28,3885.76
"(3885.76, 3890.88)", she decides today is the day and today is the day okay thanks mark,3885.76,3890.88
"(3893.6, 3895.12)", aaron did you want to continue,3893.6,3895.12
"(3898.96, 3907.78)"," okay um the next location is uh same stream op, but a little bit further downstream at Center Ditch.",3898.96,3907.78
"(3908.8, 3914.52)", The goal is to continue to retain all of that restored flow,3908.8,3914.52
"(3914.52, 3918.52)", at the higher elevations downstream past the ditch.,3914.52,3918.52
"(3919.32, 3923.52)", The the intake is quite a wide structure,3919.32,3923.52
"(3923.52, 3929.72)", and the upstream part of it on this lip right here,3923.52,3929.72
"(3930.74, 3940.28)", has some puccas in it. And so the first step would be let's fill in those puccas so that water,3930.74,3940.28
"(3940.28, 3946.6)", doesn't drain into the ditch inadvertently as depicted in this photo the bottom right photo,3940.28,3946.6
"(3947.86, 3956.44)", the next step would be to build a similar Channel across the concrete which is the the ditch itself,3947.86,3956.44
"(3956.44, 3968.08)", and then over the intake structure which is this great and the um there would be a little lip it's very similar design as the previous location and then,3956.44,3968.08
"(3968.08, 3973.68)", a bridge or a plate or something that that conveys that water downstream,3968.08,3973.68
"(3975.04, 3978.56)", so that all of the base flows retained are retained in the stream,3975.04,3978.56
"(3982.0, 3987.1)"," so aaron just real quick um similar in the proposed action, if we were to be more clear",3982.0,3987.1
"(3987.1, 3991.92)"," to say install three inch berms to direct flow into channel, that would make it more",3987.1,3991.92
"(3991.92, 3998.08)", explicit about not being these huge walls as the maybe the submittal originally depicted,3991.92,3998.08
"(3998.08, 3999.08)", via image.,3998.08,3999.08
"(3999.08, 4004.88)"," Yeah, unfortunately, the scale of the design looks like they are quite substantial structures,",3999.08,4004.88
"(4004.88, 4012.0)"," but they are going to be non-intrusive visually, I don't think, relative to the scale of the design looks like they are quite substantial structures, but they are going to be non intrusive visually I don't think relative to the rest of the concrete that's already there.",4004.88,4012.0
"(4012.0, 4023.0)", That's just to make it explicit about what the intent is correct. Okay. Yes.,4012.0,4023.0
"(4023.0, 4026.78)", And then the last one I think we have one more on this modification.,4023.0,4026.78
"(4026.78, 4031.34)", So cut a stream at center ditch.,4026.78,4031.34
"(4031.34, 4035.28)", The intake is at center ditch.,4031.34,4035.28
"(4035.28, 4051.1)"," So the center ditch runs underneath the stream in this concrete area. And at the moment on the left bank, this wing wall has a whole bunch of puccas as designed",4035.28,4051.1
"(4051.1, 4070.56)"," to divert all the low flows into the ditch. And then higher flows are diverted along the right bank over this little berm into this area, which is the gravel trap,",4051.1,4070.56
"(4070.64, 4077.14)", and then it spills into the ditch. The goal is to ensure that all of the low flows stay in the,4070.64,4077.14
"(4077.14, 4095.2)", stream. So I believe the design is to notch out this upstream lip and then create a channel across the intake,4077.14,4095.2
"(4095.2, 4105.0)"," and seal up all of these low flow hookahs and then notch a section of the downstream wall lip,",4095.2,4105.0
"(4109.8, 4113.26)", and then convey all of those low flows,4109.8,4113.26
"(4113.26, 4115.14)", from upstream and the intake downstream,4113.26,4115.14
"(4115.14, 4134.28)"," without them being diverted. And as noted, the low flow channel is to be located at or near the lowest elevation intake",4115.14,4134.28
"(4134.28, 4151.84)"," so that all of the low flows remain in the channel and don't get diverted. Again, Ken, you are Aaron's descriptions are consistent with what you are proposing.",4134.28,4151.84
"(4153.84, 4159.92)", I believe so. Roy worked on a lot of the details with the EMI folks.,4153.84,4159.92
"(4160.64, 4165.0)"," Roy, are you able to answer that question just to make sure that I'm not misspeaking?",4160.64,4165.0
"(4165.0, 4173.0)"," Yes, i'm having some. Can you hear me? I have me some zoom problems right now.",4165.0,4173.0
"(4173.0, 4178.0)"," But yeah, it's consistent. Okay, Okay, all right.",4173.0,4178.0
"(4178.0, 4187.92)", Thank you. Thank you very much. Any other questions questions commissioners oh aurora i do so um aaron it sounds like it's just a flat,4178.0,4187.92
"(4187.92, 4194.72)", metal plate that you're looking to put across and i guess is there is it going to be a little,4187.92,4194.72
"(4195.44, 4201.68)", concave to ensure that the water actually gets past the grates i'm just i i don't want to,4195.44,4201.68
"(4201.68, 4211.7)", micromanage i'm just trying to visualize what's happening. There are basically little walls. That's the three inch high reference. Okay. And we don't,4201.68,4211.7
"(4211.7, 4217.82)", want it concave in the sense that it would force all the water to flow into a somewhat narrow,4211.7,4217.82
"(4217.82, 4227.04)", channel. Our amphigermis species are really good at migrating small rivulets of water you know they they don't need,4217.82,4227.04
"(4227.6, 4237.84)", a big flow so the the more spread out it is is is actually better for um recruitment yeah but we,4227.6,4237.84
"(4237.84, 4242.4)", don't want to be spilling it over into so i guess i just need a better like the wing walls the wing,4237.84,4242.4
"(4242.4, 4245.62)", walls keep it from spilling into the intake.,4242.4,4245.62
"(4245.62, 4246.98)", Okay.,4245.62,4246.98
"(4246.98, 4248.4)"," Sorry, I don't know the terms.",4246.98,4248.4
"(4248.4, 4251.84)"," Maybe like little, if this are to be revised,",4248.4,4251.84

"(4282.82, 4294.0)"," Yeah, if just the simplified diagram, so just so that it's in the record so that we are all talking about the same thing and understanding and have the same picture in our head, that would be really, really helpful.",4282.82,4294.0
"(4294.0, 4301.0)", So these images will be amended or appended to the decision they're presented here and will be part of the minutes.,4294.0,4301.0
"(4301.0, 4305.68)", So what we're discussing will be you know hopefully it's recommended amended,4301.0,4305.68
"(4305.68, 4312.08)", will be all recorded here the intent so if it's not clear then let's make that clear,4305.68,4312.08
"(4312.8, 4318.8)", um before any action is taken any other questions or comments commissioners,4312.8,4318.8
"(4319.68, 4332.56)"," neil i just want to go back to ken's concerns. So with regard to B1, your testimony regarding kind of resisting removing infrastructure doesn't apply.",4319.68,4332.56
"(4333.12, 4346.24)"," Am I correct, Ken? Because you're being allowed to leverage a lot of the existing infrastructure just to make kind of minimal adaptations to solve our purposes but but also have that infrastructure there for",4333.12,4346.24
"(4346.24, 4352.06)", your needs as well or your class uh that is correct uh commissioner hannis okay thank you,4346.24,4352.06
"(4353.26, 4355.84)", any other questions or comments commissioners,4353.26,4355.84
"(4356.74, 4367.06)"," I have one yes um I would like to hear from um Davidmel-Frankel, just thoughts.",4356.74,4367.06
"(4367.28, 4372.06)"," And after hearing this discussion, are there still the same concerns?",4367.28,4372.06
"(4372.06, 4377.44)", I understand that there is a big thing is the notification and the quarterly meetings.,4372.06,4377.44
"(4377.44, 4380.44)", But if you can kind of reflect back.,4377.44,4380.44
"(4381.74, 4389.92)", So this has been really helpful and i think in terms of language um what i now understand,4381.74,4389.92
"(4389.92, 4400.88)", is that the three inch berm is essentially three inches higher than the sheet the metal plate or,4389.92,4400.88
"(4400.88, 4407.12)", concrete and because the way it's written in a and b submittal and as well as,4400.88,4407.12
"(4407.12, 4412.32)", sea worm submittal is that the metal sheet and concrete would be three inches high,4407.12,4412.32
"(4412.32, 4418.4)", which would sort of defeat the purpose of the lip or berm because it has to be lower so i think,4412.32,4418.4
"(4419.2, 4425.76)"," i think in some ways that uh aaron has clarified, but it would be good if that was more reflective",4419.2,4425.76
"(4425.76, 4426.68)", in your decision.,4425.76,4426.68
"(4427.78, 4432.5)"," I appreciate Mark Vaught saying that they,",4427.78,4432.5
"(4432.5, 4436.04)", I'm not sure if he's saying they never impound the water,4432.5,4436.04
"(4436.04, 4437.82)", when they do these fixes.,4436.04,4437.82
"(4438.86, 4443.26)"," If that's the case, that provides a lot of assurance,",4438.86,4443.26
"(4444.42, 4446.0)", but I'm not sure that's the case.,4444.42,4446.0
"(4446.0, 4452.0)", I would think that sometimes when you do this work there'd have to be some kind of impoundment.,4446.0,4452.0
"(4452.0, 4458.0)", But if if the commission if everyone's on the same page that there's gonna be no empowerment.,4452.0,4458.0
"(4458.0, 4462.0)"," Great. and then yeah, I think I think that takes care of everything.",4458.0,4462.0
"(4462.0, 4466.34)"," Mark, did you want to clarify that? Yeah, no, just confirming.",4462.0,4466.34
"(4466.34, 4467.54)", Mr. Franco is correct.,4466.34,4467.54
"(4468.62, 4472.7)", The general idea is not to impound a large amount of water,4468.62,4472.7
"(4472.7, 4474.16)", and then have a sudden release,4472.7,4474.16
"(4474.16, 4476.56)"," because that jeopardizes not just downstream,",4474.16,4476.56
"(4476.56, 4477.96)", but our employees as well.,4476.56,4477.96
"(4478.92, 4481.8)", But do you anticipate that there may be times,4478.92,4481.8
"(4481.8, 4483.92)", where you might have to impound the water,4481.8,4483.92
"(4483.92, 4485.5)", that would affect downstream?,4483.92,4485.5
"(4485.68, 4486.06)", Nope.,4485.68,4486.06
"(4486.38, 4486.6)", No.,4486.38,4486.6
"(4491.56, 4493.1)"," We generally, what we try to do is create a bypass with some pipes and things so that the water can continue to flow downstream.",4491.56,4493.1
"(4493.78, 4494.38)", That's excellent.,4493.78,4494.38
"(4494.72, 4494.94)", Okay.,4494.72,4494.94
"(4495.72, 4496.12)", All right.,4495.72,4496.12
"(4496.74, 4496.9)", Great.,4496.74,4496.9

"(5288.1, 5290.96)", the only thing that wasn't consistent,5288.1,5290.96
"(5290.96, 5294.14)"," was the three inch berms,",5290.96,5294.14
"(5294.14, 5297.12)", the size and scale of the berm,5294.14,5297.12

"(5301.92, 5311.12)"," And so, you know, I would just recommend for diversions w15 and c7 where those berms",5301.92,5311.12

"(5333.0, 5345.92)", That's more of an engineering question and is I think you know every all the parties understand the purpose of that berm and it's not going to be something,5333.0,5345.92
"(5345.92, 5352.4)", that is intrusive and so i think the language as submitted i think we flushed it out through,5345.92,5352.4
"(5352.4, 5360.0)", our discussions with all parties that we're in agreement that it's there for a purpose and the,5352.4,5360.0
"(5360.0, 5365.76)", purpose will be achieved and i don't think you know it matters if it's three and a half inches,5360.0,5365.76
"(5365.76, 5373.28)", or two and a half inches but that berm would be put in place and serve the purpose of uh,5365.76,5373.28
"(5373.28, 5382.4)", controlling the iifs yeah thank you maybe just to recommend to also the if the modifications do not,5373.28,5382.4
"(5382.4, 5386.88)", meet the ifs obviously the commission has to it's we set ifs,5382.4,5386.88
"(5386.88, 5392.56)", to be you know enforced and so if that isn't if the modifications as actually implemented do not,5386.88,5392.56
"(5392.56, 5399.52)", sufficiently um meet the ifs based on our own monitoring then we'll come back to the commission,5392.56,5399.52
"(5399.52, 5406.0)", and recommend further i agree that's a different issue. I agree with that.,5399.52,5406.0
"(5406.0, 5411.0)"," Can I recommend the revision, the inclusion of or clarification?",5406.0,5411.0

"(5443.12, 5447.0)", i'm just thinking the public is not going to look at 3 different documents.,5443.12,5447.0
"(5447.0, 5467.92)", They're gonna look at one. So help me out. Sorry i'm i'm i'm not very experienced in this like what would what would from Commissioner Katayama is I think he was perhaps one,5447.0,5467.92
"(5469.52, 5478.56)", the proposed clarification by Kaleo the the the staff's recommendation will reflect the discussion,5469.52,5478.56

"(5497.46, 5500.04)", then it was intentionally excluded.,5497.46,5500.04
"(5500.04, 5504.7)", So I'm a little worried about putting too much detail where,5500.04,5504.7
"(5504.7, 5506.96)", I think it appears clear,5504.7,5506.96
"(5506.96, 5514.64)", ken was given an opportunity to confirm as was mark and roy when aaron was providing his um,5506.96,5514.64
"(5516.0, 5527.28)", his clarification that i'm i guess i'm not sure i want to get into too much detail unless the commissioners feel otherwise,5516.0,5527.28
"(5533.36, 5540.8)", because i think ken roy and mark you guys know what our intent know what the commissioners um intentions are um what the ifs and as i understand that this is this can be modified right khalil,5533.36,5540.8
"(5540.8, 5547.0)"," yeah this is these are modifications so they're you it's not, we're not abandoning these divergents.",5540.8,5547.0
"(5547.0, 5552.0)"," They would, there's still a relationship between the Commission and EMI as a diverter.",5547.0,5552.0
"(5552.0, 5568.96)"," And I'm also optimistic that there will be more quarterly meetings where the community will have an opportunity to be have, be included in some of these discussions before they get to the commission so some of",5552.0,5568.96
"(5568.96, 5574.8)", this can be worked out at that level as well that as dean described the first meeting was more sort,5568.96,5574.8
"(5574.8, 5580.8)", of meet greet introductions setting you know parameters and then as they get into more,5574.8,5580.8
"(5580.8, 5586.8)", regular quarterly meetings there will be more specific discussions on proposed,5580.8,5586.8

"(6116.36, 6121.16)", This is an abandonment of the stream diversion work.,6116.36,6121.16

"(6127.36, 6134.96)", um are there any questions yeah any i guess what i'd like to do is um aaron you do do your overview,6127.36,6134.96
"(6134.96, 6140.0)", for each of these um any questions from the commissioners and then i'd like to make sure,6134.96,6140.0
"(6140.0, 6148.64)", that ken either ken or roy confirmed that that aaron's description is consistent with your,6140.0,6148.64
"(6148.64, 6155.04)", understanding as well okay all right so any questions from the commissioners on aaron's,6148.64,6155.04
"(6155.84, 6161.52)", um overview yes neil so we know that the issue is going to arise as to how much you have the,6155.84,6161.52
"(6161.52, 6165.52)", applicant remove so in this case they're not removing everything,6161.52,6165.52
"(6166.88, 6173.6)", no because the the the you can see the concrete structure that the ditch flows in right here so,6166.88,6173.6
"(6173.6, 6191.3)"," this is the ditch is flowing right here okay so i you know we'll break that, we'll break that wall and create a gap and capture flow, but the applicant will be allowed to leave in place all that other infrastructure.",6173.6,6191.3

"(6215.86, 6217.84)"," So, Aaron, the current recommendation",6215.86,6217.84
"(6217.84, 6220.88)"," is just to remove grate and seal the hole in a ditch,",6217.84,6220.88
"(6220.88, 6222.56)", and there's been no recommendations,6220.88,6222.56
"(6222.56, 6224.62)", to modify that wall at this time.,6222.56,6224.62
"(6227.92, 6234.88)", Okay. That's not what i heard correct so that's why i'm just making the crosswalks so part of what um and,6227.92,6234.88
"(6234.88, 6242.4)", this is also uh internal coordination so we have a permit branch okay and dean is in charge of both,6234.88,6242.4
"(6242.4, 6250.02)"," the permit side as well as insurance side so we're crosswalking the sewer recommendation, which is primarily focused on the IFS and",6242.4,6250.02
"(6250.02, 6255.32)", then the permitting or abandonment of the diversions that's handled by another branch,6250.02,6255.32
"(6255.32, 6257.6)", in surface water.,6255.32,6257.6
"(6257.6, 6262.8)", So what's being proposed or recommended in the application is just to remove the grate,6257.6,6262.8
"(6262.8, 6265.92)", and seal the hole so the intake no longer functions,6262.8,6265.92
"(6265.92, 6272.24)", but there's been no recommended modifications of that that wall that's basically holding up,6265.92,6272.24
"(6272.24, 6276.8)", the ditch although aaron said he thinks it could be done that's not what's in the proposal i'm,6272.24,6276.8
"(6276.8, 6281.12)", just making that very clear that's that's important because that's not correct okay,6276.8,6281.12
"(6282.0, 6287.0)", all right i will i will continue with that there.,6282.0,6287.0
"(6287.0, 6295.0)", There might be modifications wall that are permissible without damaging the structural integrity of it like notching.,6287.0,6295.0
"(6295.0, 6303.0)", I don't know some width in the middle or putting pukas through it.,6295.0,6303.0
"(6303.0, 6305.24)", You know I i'm not the engineer.,6303.0,6305.24
"(6305.24, 6310.08)"," I don't know how it was built, but I just I know that the primary purpose",6305.24,6310.08
"(6310.08, 6313.32)", is to remove this diversion from its function,6310.08,6313.32
"(6314.44, 6316.28)", by sealing it.,6314.44,6316.28
"(6316.28, 6320.92)", And I believe that they will just concrete over the intake,6316.28,6320.92
"(6320.92, 6324.88)", so that there's there's no possibility that any water could be diverted.,6320.92,6324.88
"(6327.06, 6328.22)"," Okay, let's hear from Ken.",6327.06,6328.22
"(6328.4, 6333.34)"," Sra22 Panellist, Ken Roy to confirm what are you proposing in your application.",6328.4,6333.34

"(6338.3, 6347.04)"," Ken Roy- Roy actually has the applications up, which I think is not visible by the commissioners.",6338.3,6347.04
"(6347.06, 6352.84)", But Roy can look at the applications on what was submitted and corroborate or,6347.06,6352.84
"(6352.86, 6356.4)", clarify any differences.,6352.86,6356.4
"(6356.44, 6358.72)"," Yeah. Thank you, Ken.",6356.44,6358.72
"(6358.76, 6363.68)"," Generally, what Deputy Manuel clarified is correct.",6358.76,6363.68
"(6363.72, 6366.6)", There was nothing about the removal of the wall,6363.72,6366.6
"(6366.6, 6368.9)", that Aaron is talking about.,6366.6,6368.9
"(6368.9, 6370.88)", It's just sealing the intake,6368.9,6370.88
"(6370.88, 6373.86)", to allow all the flows to bypass.,6370.88,6373.86
"(6375.62, 6376.68)", So that's true.,6375.62,6376.68
"(6378.26, 6381.32)", Wall removal was not part of the proposal,6378.26,6381.32
"(6381.32, 6382.16)", in the application.,6381.32,6382.16
"(6382.16, 6396.0)", I would maybe recommend that the submittal request that you might evaluate how much of the wall can be removed without damaging the integrity of the ditch.,6382.16,6396.0
"(6396.0, 6407.0)"," Aaron Miller Sr.: and proceed with that Aaron, maybe to help facilitate the conversation.",6396.0,6407.0
"(6407.0, 6408.0)", Sorry.,6407.0,6408.0
"(6408.0, 6409.0)", No commission.,6408.0,6409.0
"(6409.0, 6416.46)", There's with the reestablishment of the ifs or mock provisions upstream of this diversion.,6409.0,6416.46
"(6416.46, 6421.46)", What is the flow that's anticipated below that upper diversion to reach this one?,6416.46,6421.46
"(6421.46, 6425.28)", Or is this a losing part of the stream or is it a gaining part of this,6421.46,6425.28
"(6434.56, 6436.16)", it's a gaining stream um there is a large uh lava tube at the base of a waterfall that um,6434.56,6436.16
"(6478.94, 6479.94)"," you know at just below the wailoa ditch on ho'olabanui but the overall it's gaining downstream and below this intake it's gaining so that the goal is to get all of these low flows downstream to the in stream values such't want the water pooling up behind the dam, you know, if pucas can be put into it, if a notch can be cut out of it to convey the water downstream more effectively, that would help, I think.",6478.94,6479.94
"(6484.12, 6485.46)"," Kaleo, I'm wondering, and I'm talking out loud,",6484.12,6485.46
"(6490.46, 6493.08)"," Aaron, do you have more recommendations",6490.46,6493.08
"(6496.8, 6500.42)", than what is being proposed in the application? Because is it better for staff to go back,6496.8,6500.42
"(6500.42, 6504.52)", and work with the applicant and then resubmit this,6500.42,6504.52
"(6504.52, 6507.74)", when there's some internal discussion because,6504.52,6507.74
"(6507.74, 6517.1)", I'm I am also concerned about Ken's 343 question so I I'm wondering if it might be more productive,6507.74,6517.1
"(6517.1, 6527.74)", for there to be internal discussion with the applicant rather than proceeding? I think we can work through it today. I don't think,6517.1,6527.74
"(6527.74, 6535.28)", many of the recommendations are substantial. I just know that I'm busy on the in-stream use,6527.74,6535.28
"(6535.28, 6542.1)"," section side of things, as you will find out later, and finding time to meet to discuss",6535.28,6542.1
"(6542.1, 6548.16)", regulatory issues are challenging. Okay challenging okay hello you have a recommendation,6542.1,6548.16
"(6548.16, 6555.04)", yeah I'm open to either chair I mean we could go through it and see if it's a majority of again,6548.16,6555.04
"(6556.24, 6562.88)", the goal is to the commission give a timeline to modify and abandon in order to meet the ifs,6556.24,6562.88
"(6562.88, 6566.22)", because that's our goal but we want We want to protect the industry values.,6562.88,6566.22
"(6566.22, 6569.24)"," And so there was a similar recommendation in November,",6566.22,6569.24

"(6591.88, 6597.1)", We can do we do the presentations on the stream work that you're doing today um.,6591.88,6597.1
"(6597.58, 6613.76)", And if that's okay with the applicant give us more time to work with Community applicant through the abandonment one the modification submittal prior was pretty um direct and straightforward yeah that that would be my because i i am based on one,6597.58,6613.76
"(6613.76, 6629.6)", hearing ken's opening remarks um and just my own concern because part of your submittal is a 343 exemption and if indeed we are going to be doing work that may trigger 343,6613.76,6629.6
"(6629.6, 6635.36)", i would rather have that internally discussed before it comes back to the commission,6629.6,6635.36
"(6636.56, 6642.4)", can we walk through the submittal however i i don't believe that um we're that far off with,6636.56,6642.4
"(6642.4, 6656.0)", what ken was had an issue with and many of these modifications are going to be full stream diversion abandonments which we the applicant knows.,6642.4,6656.0
"(6656.0, 6670.0)"," I mean that wasn't up for discussion. Yeah, let's let's table for now, because i'd rather make I want to make sure that we are in alignment before we continue the conversation.",6656.0,6670.0
"(6670.0, 6674.0)", So we can just defer for now. I appreciate that.,6670.0,6674.0
"(6674.0, 6680.0)"," Thanks, Aaron. Okay, we don't need a motion on that.",6674.0,6680.0
"(6680.0, 6685.0)"," Oh, no, just we'll defer. All right. We still have the right to testify.",6680.0,6685.0
"(6685.0, 6696.0)"," Yes. So commissioners, do you have any questions about the deferral and what's being proposed?",6685.0,6696.0
"(6696.0, 6711.4)", Okay. All right. With that we'll take public comments and David Kimo Frankel go ahead. Thank you on behalf of the Sierra Club again. I do think Mr. Kawahara has misled you a bit.,6696.0,6711.4
"(6711.4, 6716.9)", So I want to be very clear about this. It may be an interim in stream flow standard.,6711.4,6716.9
"(6716.9, 6726.96)"," But when you talk about abandonment, that is permanent. Okay. Abandonment is not a temporary measure it is permanent let me read from you",6716.9,6726.96
"(6726.96, 6733.36)", read to you a little section of from black's law dictionary abandon is to give up or to cease to,6726.96,6733.36

"(6754.82, 6759.84)", And there are some legal challenges you will face down the road,6754.82,6759.84

"(6780.46, 6790.0)", That's why the Division of Aquatic Resources recommendations that your staff has agreed to are so important.,6780.46,6790.0
"(6790.0, 6812.74)", Now the Sierra Club is a balanced approach.,6790.0,6812.74

"(6827.6, 6835.2)", from these structures which should not be in a stream i also want to point out to you,6827.6,6835.2
"(6835.2, 6847.0)", that the amount of water that is proposed to be left in these streams is a very small amount.,6835.2,6847.0

"(6857.0, 6861.0)"," There are very little amounts of water. So when Mr. Kawahara says,",6857.0,6861.0
"(6861.0, 6865.14)"," well, in the future, we might want more water from these streams.",6861.0,6865.14
"(6865.26, 6866.86)", And so we might need these structures.,6865.26,6866.86

"(10910.86, 10920.22)"," had USGS gauges for 50, 60 years. And we measured low flow conditions that were",10910.86,10920.22
"(10921.3, 10929.34)"," as bad, if not worse, than the entire recorded period of record, which is alarming. And it",10921.3,10929.34
"(10929.34, 10935.5)", allowed us to quantify those low flow conditions under current climate conditions rather rapidly.,10929.34,10935.5
"(10935.5, 10943.68)", We did a three-year study in about 18 months based on conversations with USGS on what it,10935.5,10943.68
"(10943.68, 10946.0)", would take to do what we did.,10943.68,10946.0
"(10946.0, 10951.0)", And that's just because we happen to hit it in an extreme drought condition.,10946.0,10951.0
"(10951.0, 10965.76)"," So that's that's the most alarming on the on the bioticide we've seen a lack of expected recruitment to streams like on windward, a wahoo like'ahole where there's been a lot of restored flow",10951.0,10965.76
"(10966.36, 10974.82)", and I believe that's related to like vegetation management in the estuary there is a huge portion,10966.36,10974.82
"(10974.82, 10983.1)", there's a huge reach of the stream that's clogged with halbush and just like in Kahana where the,10974.82,10983.1
"(10983.1, 10988.16)", the lack of maintenance or the overgrowth of invasive vegetation has clogged the,10983.1,10988.16
"(10988.16, 10991.52)"," stream channel, it's really affected the recruitment of native species. I'm not saying",10988.16,10991.52
"(10991.52, 10998.32)"," there are no native species, but in a stream that's in essence fully baseflow restored,",10991.52,10998.32
"(10998.32, 11006.6)"," if not more so, we didn't see a single alamo'o at the 400 foot elevation or Nopili, which is really disheartening.",10998.32,11006.6

"(11012.82, 11015.58)", I think they manage for like Miconia and that sort of thing.,11012.82,11015.58
"(11015.66, 11022.04)"," But the overall, the watershed is dominated by non-native invasive vegetation.",11015.66,11022.04
"(11022.42, 11026.78)", And so that I think plays a role. And we have yet to really,11022.42,11026.78
"(11026.78, 11031.84)"," strongly quantify that role, but that's part of why we are gathering the data is to quantify that",11026.78,11031.84
"(11031.84, 11037.84)"," role. Last week, we surveyed a higher elevation reach in Waikane and found four different native",11031.84,11037.84
"(11037.84, 11047.46)"," species, or three different native species. And that was amazing. i thought that was i mean waikane is uh doesn't",11037.84,11047.46

"(11053.08, 11058.08)", problem there are a lot of uh junk cars in the stream a lot of cesspools in the watershed there's,11053.08,11058.08
"(11058.08, 11069.4)", you know other things that you might think would negatively affect um uh the the stream health. But we saw Naniha and Nakhea and Nopili and Holi-Holi,11058.08,11069.4
"(11069.98, 11072.14)"," at a higher elevation, higher than I thought",11069.98,11072.14

"(11073.34, 11075.58)", So that was enlightening.,11073.34,11075.58

"(11577.68, 11585.52)"," All right, so per Chair Chang's request uh she asked that i provide an update to the",11577.68,11585.52
"(11585.52, 11592.88)", commission on basically a recap of the past four months um our legislative journey through 2023,11585.52,11592.88
"(11593.44, 11598.72)", and so um this is really again very high level it's not going to get into a lot of the details,11593.44,11598.72
"(11598.72, 11606.0)", um on on everything but just a high level of the Water Commission and our staff and our work at the legislature.,11598.72,11606.0
"(11606.0, 11616.0)"," So first I'm going to talk about the bills that we engage with, the testimony, some of the bills we've seen, policies that are coming forward, and then a discussion in a budget.",11606.0,11616.0
"(11616.0, 11620.0)", So a lot of the conversation today has been about resources and budgets.,11616.0,11620.0
"(11620.0, 11625.2)", I'll just share where we're at at the end of this legislative session okay so that's,11620.0,11625.2
"(11626.8, 11636.56)", first stop all right so uh water bills of 2023 it was an extremely busy uh session on water uh and i,11626.8,11636.56
"(11636.56, 11640.96)", think doh can concur with that uh there was a lot of focus which is great which means that we're,11636.56,11640.96
"(11640.96, 11645.56)", focusing a lot on our needs and where we value water.,11640.96,11645.56
"(11645.56, 11649.36)", So we tracked about 153 bills.,11645.56,11649.36
"(11649.36, 11651.66)", Obviously not all of them we testified on.,11649.36,11651.66
"(11651.66, 11653.22)"," We were monitoring most of them,",11651.66,11653.22
"(11654.1, 11656.96)", but there was some water nexus with what we worked on.,11654.1,11656.96
"(11658.0, 11662.18)"," We testified on 19 bills, not including hospital 300.",11658.0,11662.18
"(11662.18, 11666.96)", And so just here's a quick summary of the bills and i've shortened and,11662.18,11666.96
"(11666.96, 11671.36)", abbreviated kind of the points on them so if we can i think it'd be worthwhile for the commission,11666.96,11671.36
"(11671.36, 11677.44)", to understand and see what was discussed because a lot of these that did not pass will be potentially,11671.36,11677.44
"(11677.44, 11682.48)", alive right for next session so some things for us to consider and we'd love your feedback from,11677.44,11682.48
"(11682.48, 11691.0)", the larger commission on some of these bills so the first one is efficiency standards hospital 194 it set minimum efficiency standards for a,11682.48,11691.0
"(11691.0, 11695.98)", bunch of appliances but where we are focused was toilets and urinals obviously um we're supportive,11691.0,11695.98
"(11695.98, 11702.58)", of of low low flow fixtures and just efficiencies in in our our built environment so we supported,11695.98,11702.58
"(11702.58, 11707.84)"," that um the next one was hospital 36 362, State Water Code Penalties.",11702.58,11707.84
"(11707.84, 11709.92)"," I'll go into that and others later,",11707.84,11709.92
"(11709.92, 11713.02)", because there was another bill that had the same language,11709.92,11713.02
"(11713.02, 11713.94)", that did pass.,11713.02,11713.94
"(11713.94, 11716.66)", And so we'll highlight exactly what happened in that.,11713.94,11716.66
"(11717.58, 11719.96)", House Bill 546 was related,11717.58,11719.96
"(11719.96, 11721.62)", to the Fuel Tank Advisory Committee.,11719.96,11721.62
"(11721.62, 11724.7)"," This was one that we testified in support,",11721.62,11724.7
"(11724.7, 11726.56)", but it increases the,11724.7,11726.56
"(11726.56, 11734.16)", frequency of these meetings uh from i think annual to quarterly um that also asked to increase uh,11726.56,11734.16
"(11734.16, 11741.12)", provide a budget to hold and host these still tank advisory committee meetings um that was one that,11734.16,11741.12
"(11741.12, 11746.0)", we we engaged with and obviously supported with alongside Department of Health.,11741.12,11746.0
"(11746.0, 11767.76)"," House Bill 905 was related to sustainable groundwater yields, and this was proposing that you agent the Water Commission look at developing you know flexible groundwater model that moves kind of beyond the RAM model, or the round equation that we use to set sustainable yields to include other things, other public trust uses that we have an obligation to protect. So that includes",11746.0,11767.76
"(11767.76, 11772.64)", traditional customary practices and groundwater dependent ecosystems. And try to better understand,11767.76,11772.64
"(11772.64, 11778.08)", how can we factor in how much water needs to kind of remain in the ground in order to support these,11772.64,11778.08
"(11778.08, 11784.32)", other types of public trust uses. House Bill 909 was related to water conservation. So there was,11778.08,11784.32
"(11784.32, 11786.48)", a push to develop a water neutrality,11784.32,11786.48
"(11786.48, 11787.84)", turf replacement program.,11786.48,11787.84
"(11787.84, 11791.22)", So you can see that there's some end use management,11787.84,11791.22
"(11791.22, 11794.94)", that's being considered by the legislature,11791.22,11794.94
"(11794.94, 11798.74)", that would basically incentivize people,11794.94,11798.74
"(11798.74, 11801.3)", kind of taking out lawns and replacing with turf.,11798.74,11801.3
"(11801.3, 11804.62)", What kind of reductions in water use could we see,11801.3,11804.62
"(11804.62, 11807.76)", based on that shift.,11804.62,11807.76
"(11807.76, 11812.32)", House Bill 1212 was water neutrality.,11807.76,11812.32
"(11812.32, 11814.96)", This was a goal to become water neutral by 2050.,11812.32,11814.96
"(11814.96, 11820.76)"," I think the intent was for the water that we use, we also develop or create equal amounts",11814.96,11820.76
"(11820.76, 11827.68)"," of water, whether that's through reuse, recharge, other types of process to",11820.76,11827.68
"(11827.68, 11829.68)", source augmentation.,11827.68,11829.68
"(11829.68, 11834.1)", House Bill 1303 related to water conservation.,11829.68,11834.1
"(11834.1, 11839.76)", This was a pilot that was proposed in the counties to incentivize landscape alternatives.,11834.1,11839.76
"(11839.76, 11845.26)"," So again, some more of this end use management.",11839.76,11845.26
"(11847.88, 11849.48)", And I think the pilot was for Hawaii County and City and County of Honolulu.,11847.88,11849.48
"(11851.28, 11854.18)", That was hospital 1303.,11851.28,11854.18
"(11854.18, 11857.98)", Hospital 1405 related to natural resources,11854.18,11857.98
"(11858.86, 11863.24)"," was to have with the Water Commission, DAR, and UH",11858.86,11863.24
"(11863.24, 11866.16)", to conduct LIMU research and with the water commission dar and uh to conduct limo research and understand the needs,11863.24,11866.16
"(11866.16, 11873.04)", or basically how um what are the water demands and needs of of native limos and this is building off,11866.16,11873.04
"(11873.04, 11879.04)", of some of the research that has already been done in off the shore of kona but to expand this to,11873.04,11879.04
"(11879.04, 11886.32)", additional um limo species and as well as better understanding invasive species impacts on that development.,11879.04,11886.32
"(11886.32, 11893.12)"," And then lastly, House Bill 1511 related to water resources was a grant in aid to the Board of",11886.32,11893.12
"(11893.12, 11898.24)", Water Supply for seven monitoring wells and one export well and this is in response to the Red,11893.12,11898.24
"(11898.24, 11903.52)", Hill situation where their sources have been offline. There's potential threats to their,11898.24,11903.52
"(11903.52, 11906.26)", existing sources and wanting to better understand,11903.52,11906.26
"(11906.26, 11908.3)", the extent of potential contamination.,11906.26,11908.3
"(11908.3, 11911.7)"," And so I will say throughout this session,",11908.3,11911.7
"(11911.7, 11914.9)"," we testified either in comment or in support,",11911.7,11914.9
"(11914.9, 11917.66)", we did not oppose any of the bills that were presented,11914.9,11917.66
"(11917.66, 11920.8)", that were in alignment with the what the water code,11917.66,11920.8
"(11920.8, 11923.06)", anticipates and kind of what the commissioners,11920.8,11923.06
"(11923.06, 11926.96)", historically asked us to to opine on,11923.06,11926.96
"(11929.12, 11934.4)", shifting to senate bills so this is a continuation of those 19 bills that we provided testimony on,11929.12,11934.4
"(11935.84, 11941.44)", so senate bill 71 relating for environmental impact statements again we just commented on,11935.84,11941.44
"(11941.44, 11967.52)"," this one we didn't oppose it but this one exempts drilling of wells on DOA land from completing, being required to go to Chapter 343 HRS to develop or do an environmental assessment. really rely um focused on potential threat to to aquifer or con wells acting as conduits especially",11941.44,11967.52
"(11967.52, 11973.12)", in an agricultural environment and just making sure that um we believe the design standards,11967.52,11973.12
"(11973.12, 11979.84)", our well standards really um protect against that contamination but there are other secondary,11973.12,11979.84
"(11979.84, 11986.22)", human impacts um that that potentially should have been considered. So that's Senate Bill 71.,11979.84,11986.22
"(11986.22, 11990.48)", Senate Bill 93 relates to reuse zones.,11986.22,11990.48
"(11990.48, 11994.06)"," This was to establish reuse zones,",11990.48,11994.06
"(11994.06, 11999.06)", so where new developments that would rely,11994.06,11999.06
"(11999.96, 12002.06)"," or need non-potable water,",11999.96,12002.06
"(12002.06, 12004.66)", it would basically require mandatory reuse zones.,12002.06,12004.66
"(12004.66, 12005.68)", So you would have to develop,12004.66,12005.68
"(12005.68, 12011.28)", a dual line system for uh potable would serve your potable needs and then you'd have an opportunity,12005.68,12011.28
"(12011.28, 12017.84)", to reuse water for non-potable needs um within a certain distance so there was no distance this,12011.28,12017.84
"(12017.84, 12025.76)", uh determined yet but that was what the bill contemplated senate bill 735 disposition of water rights we were second on this to land,12017.84,12025.76
"(12025.76, 12032.88)", division but this focus of this bill was to build off of last session's bill but this one,12025.76,12032.88
"(12032.88, 12038.16)", specifically would exempt in-stream use of water for commercial colo from having to obtain a water,12032.88,12038.16
"(12038.16, 12045.88)", license so last session there was a bill that exempted in-stream use of water for color cultivation for tradition,12038.16,12045.88
"(12045.88, 12048.5)", customary practices from water licensing.,12045.88,12048.5
"(12048.5, 12052.68)", This one went a step further to include commercial.,12048.5,12052.68
"(12052.68, 12059.52)"," That was what was basically recommended, and so we supported land division in that process.",12052.68,12059.52
"(12059.52, 12066.58)"," Senate Bill 1066 relates to freshwater security, recommended a working group to develop or come up with",12059.52,12066.58
"(12066.58, 12071.38)", a list of priorities to increase our water security throughout the state.,12066.58,12071.38

"(12077.92, 12089.44)", for our buck on where we can align as a state and invest in you know a more water resilient future a senate bill 1459 related,12077.92,12089.44
"(12089.44, 12095.44)", to environmental protection um asked uh this was mostly a doh bill i think was the focus doh and,12089.44,12095.44
"(12095.44, 12099.44)", border water supply but to put together a water quality task force to address some of the,12095.44,12099.44

"(12151.88, 12153.96)", And so the next two slides will go through each of those,12151.88,12153.96
"(12153.96, 12154.8)", in a little bit more detail,12153.96,12154.8
"(12154.8, 12158.28)", so you can see exactly what those bills look like.,12154.8,12158.28
"(12158.28, 12159.64)"," There were no resolutions,",12158.28,12159.64

"(12233.68, 12235.08)"," But yeah, that's it.",12233.68,12235.08
"(12235.08, 12237.14)", We've been fortunate to not have vacancies.,12235.08,12237.14

"(12240.84, 12243.52)", a different process than most boards and commissions.,12240.84,12243.52
"(12243.52, 12246.06)", It has very explicit process that we have to follow.,12243.52,12246.06
"(12246.42, 12259.92)"," Councillor John Gallo, On it's quite time consuming but we've been able to accomplish that get names the governor governor getting names this and and been able to confirm every Commissioner, at least in the past four years, so that way we have a full full form full bottom.",12246.42,12259.92

"(12275.0, 12287.5)"," Thank you. I'm just going to keep jamming. So the first bill, and I try to get images to kind of match",12275.0,12287.5
"(12287.5, 12290.34)", what the intent of some of these conversations are.,12287.5,12290.34
"(12290.34, 12295.6)", So the first one was House Bill 1088 on declaration of water shortage and emergency.,12290.34,12295.6
"(12295.6, 12299.26)"," And so this was an administrative bill that we proposed,",12295.6,12299.26
"(12299.26, 12304.64)", the Water Commission staff proposed in the last administration under Governor Ige.,12299.26,12304.64
"(12307.28, 12312.88)"," And this really came out of the Red Hill Permanent Interaction Group conversations, our conversations with our AGs about the limits",12307.28,12312.88
"(12312.88, 12319.12)"," of our current statute and some of the Chapter 62 and the process that we, you know, as it reads,",12312.88,12319.12
"(12319.84, 12326.36)", how really focused and we have to go through in order to kind of act in times of emergency.,12319.84,12326.36
"(12326.36, 12328.32)"," And so the intent here was really to look,",12326.36,12328.32
"(12328.32, 12331.12)", what we did was we looked at the statute,12328.32,12331.12
"(12331.12, 12332.28)"," and it was really a chance,",12331.12,12332.28
"(12332.28, 12334.32)", and here's a summary of the intent,12332.28,12334.32
"(12334.32, 12336.14)", and the amendments that were made,12334.32,12336.14
"(12336.14, 12337.28)", as part of the administrative bill.,12336.14,12337.28
"(12337.28, 12340.98)", So it was to bifurcate shortage from emergency,12337.28,12340.98
"(12340.98, 12344.06)", and why we recommended that was shortages,12340.98,12344.06
"(12344.06, 12346.16)", that we can anticipate based on climate,12344.06,12346.16
"(12346.16, 12351.68)", or based on droughts we have an opportunity to kind of work and plan for but in terms of,12346.16,12351.68
"(12351.68, 12358.08)", emergencies for example like red hill um sometimes there's a need to act quickly and make orders or,12351.68,12358.08
"(12358.08, 12366.5)", or act and so similar to like department of Health that has emergency orders and powers in their ability,12358.08,12366.5
"(12366.5, 12369.46)"," to act, we're looking for parity on the quantity side.",12366.5,12369.46
"(12369.46, 12374.28)"," So if we needed to act, that it would give the commission the ability to act, but it",12369.46,12374.28
"(12374.28, 12376.28)", also would retain due process.,12374.28,12376.28
"(12376.28, 12381.66)"," So in the code already, it already anticipates that if an emergency is issued, that the orders",12376.28,12381.66
"(12381.66, 12385.5)"," would stand, but somebody can contest the orders,",12381.66,12385.5
"(12385.5, 12387.64)", but we would have to go through that contested case hearing,12385.5,12387.64
"(12387.64, 12389.92)", process in order to determine whether or not,12387.64,12389.92
"(12389.92, 12391.96)"," they have standing, whether or not they,",12389.92,12391.96
"(12391.96, 12394.12)", those orders are overreaching.,12391.96,12394.12
"(12394.12, 12394.96)", So that was the intent.,12394.12,12394.96
"(12394.96, 12398.26)", The first part is to bifurcate shortage from emergency.,12394.96,12398.26
"(12398.26, 12401.82)"," Emergency in the code is defined in section three,",12398.26,12401.82
"(12401.82, 12405.3)"," but the only other time it comes up is in 62,",12401.82,12405.3
"(12405.3, 12407.68)", under shortage and then an emergency.,12405.3,12407.68
"(12407.68, 12410.16)"," But in this case, the Red Hill situation",12407.68,12410.16
"(12410.16, 12414.16)", really highlighted the need for us to maybe pull that out.,12410.16,12414.16
"(12414.16, 12416.5)"," So this is what we recommended, a bifurcation.",12414.16,12416.5
"(12417.78, 12421.46)"," It again, just reaffirms the commission's jurisdiction",12417.78,12421.46
"(12421.46, 12423.04)"," in and outside of water management areas,",12421.46,12423.04
"(12423.04, 12424.54)", which is already in the code.,12423.04,12424.54
"(12424.54, 12428.16)", It already says the commission has authority of water as a primary agency with that,12424.54,12428.16
"(12428.2, 12431.92)"," Kuleana, whether in or outside of a water management area.",12428.2,12431.92
"(12431.96, 12436.32)"," At the end of it, what we worked with and consulted with the boards of water supply",12431.96,12436.32
"(12436.36, 12440.68)", and departments of Waterside based on the comments and ultimately the opposition,12436.36,12440.68
"(12440.72, 12466.84)"," of the board to incorporate consultation with the county and Department of Health before an emergency is issued with the intent need to, as this body is selected by the governor,",12440.72,12466.84
"(12466.84, 12467.96)"," confirmed by the Senate,",12466.84,12467.96
"(12467.96, 12470.18)"," as the experts on water management,",12467.96,12470.18
"(12470.18, 12472.46)", that they need the authority and the ability,12470.18,12472.46
"(12472.46, 12475.28)"," to act in an efficient way in times of an emergency,",12472.46,12475.28
"(12475.28, 12477.5)", but understanding that would have to be done,12475.28,12477.5
"(12477.5, 12480.18)", with the county and the Department of Health.,12477.5,12480.18
"(12480.18, 12483.32)"," It also, again, would allow us to act immediately.",12480.18,12483.32
"(12483.32, 12490.56)", And then one of the amendments we put in there is that we do need to look at shortages statewide um originally the way that the code is written,12483.32,12490.56
"(12491.44, 12497.84)", water shortages fall under the water management area provisions um but we know that whether you're,12491.44,12497.84
"(12497.84, 12506.96)", in a management area or not in a management area we have a need to really address shortages holistically no matter where you are,12497.84,12506.96
"(12508.8, 12513.36)", and then just here highlights some of the testimony we received but ultimately the bill did,12508.8,12513.36
"(12513.92, 12518.8)", did evolve throughout the session based on consultation based on outreach based on testimony,12513.92,12518.8
"(12518.8, 12533.24)"," we did receive and then unfortunately it did pass and so we are waiting for governors obviously decision to either approve the bill or not, and then some of the next steps related to this this statue.",12518.8,12533.24
"(12535.48, 12545.0)", Michael Rhoadsley- This is Michael with a comments from the board of water supply really just focused on consultation or were they more deeper than that?,12535.48,12545.0
"(12545.7, 12547.96)"," Yeah, so the, again, high level,",12545.7,12547.96
"(12547.96, 12551.1)", I didn't wanna go point by point for all of the testimony.,12547.96,12551.1
"(12551.1, 12554.62)", There were some concern that the bill as drafted,12551.1,12554.62
"(12554.62, 12556.16)"," would circumvent the commission,",12554.62,12556.16
"(12556.16, 12558.8)"," I mean, the governor's authority under 127A",12556.16,12558.8
"(12558.8, 12561.82)", in terms of governor and mayor's ability,12558.8,12561.82
"(12561.82, 12563.32)", to declare an emergency.,12561.82,12563.32
"(12564.6, 12565.92)", What we provided in our,12564.6,12565.92
"(12565.92, 12570.72)", testimony and our responses to that comment was that you know similar to department of health in,12565.92,12570.72
"(12570.72, 12575.68)", their regulation of water quality we're just looking at specifically related to water quantity,12570.72,12575.68
"(12575.68, 12580.8)", and having the ability to do that even if the governor did declare an emergency which we would,12575.68,12580.8
"(12580.8, 12588.74)"," work with governor obviously as the agency to do we'd still have to come up with orders, right? We'd still, even if you suspended something, there still needs",12580.8,12588.74
"(12588.74, 12593.76)"," to be orders that need to be developed on how to address the emergency. And so it would,",12588.74,12593.76
"(12593.76, 12598.72)"," ultimately the goal would be is this body, right, who understands the worldview of water",12593.76,12598.72
"(12598.72, 12607.2)", resources would be able to provide that expertise and guidance on the specific orders um to address the concern and so,12598.72,12607.2
"(12607.2, 12614.08)", one of the other issues is a lot of times um people get confused with the kuleana of the board,12607.2,12614.08
"(12614.08, 12619.68)", of water supply and the commission and so we have an obligation to all water users in the state the,12614.08,12619.68
"(12619.68, 12626.4)", board is one of many right um or the departments of water supply one of many users we have to we have the,12619.68,12626.4
"(12626.4, 12632.0)", the purview and the world view to be inclusive and to look at all users throughout the state,12626.4,12632.0
"(12632.0, 12638.88)", so there were a couple um other concerns about there's no criteria in which and when an emergency,12632.0,12638.88
"(12638.88, 12643.36)", can be issued but that is actually in the definition in the code of what an emergency,12638.88,12643.36
"(12643.36, 12647.62)", is it has explicit um when there's insufficient quantity quality.,12643.36,12647.62
"(12648.1, 12652.3)"," E.J. That affects public health, safety, then emergency could be determined.",12648.1,12652.3
"(12652.66, 12665.76)"," E.J. um as well as it says the Commission it doesn't delegate it to the director or the Chair it doesn't delegate it to the deputy so this body as a whole, would have to make that emergency decision and as a body we have to have a sunshine meeting",12652.66,12665.76
"(12665.76, 12672.72)", in order to do that so there's process um to provide due process to all people in the public,12665.76,12672.72
"(12672.72, 12679.2)", including users to opine or provide feedback at least that's the way that we were trying to,12672.72,12679.2
"(12679.2, 12685.84)", propose the bill as drafted and ultimately approved what was was the basis of LRF's opposition?,12679.2,12685.84
"(12686.98, 12690.8)", Similar to a lot of the county's concerns,12686.98,12690.8
"(12690.8, 12693.62)"," about the governor should have the ultimate authority,",12690.8,12693.62

"(12703.3, 12705.52)", those are some of the ultimate concerns,12703.3,12705.52
"(12705.52, 12717.44)", in opposition and and i will share with you this bill was not without well kaleo was doing a good,12705.52,12717.44
"(12717.44, 12729.2)", job addressing the various comments that were timely presented primarily by the board of water supply and by the county departments,12717.44,12729.2
"(12730.0, 12736.88)", and so adjustments were made to the bill and it went it got out of committee got out of conference,12730.0,12736.88
"(12736.88, 12743.84)", committee and it was passed um i i just want to be very candid with you i think there are some,12736.88,12743.84
"(12746.8, 12751.04)", who are concerned about the bill and have expressed their concerns to the governor's office so i'm not sure if the,12746.8,12751.04
"(12751.04, 12758.32)", bill is going to get vetoed but we continue to stand um firm in support of this bill and that,12751.04,12758.32
"(12758.32, 12767.68)", was our our comments back to the governor that we we support this bill it does provide additional assurances and we think,12758.32,12767.68
"(12767.68, 12775.36)", we addressed all of the concerns but on the other side if we don't get the bill passed um in talking,12767.68,12775.36
"(12775.36, 12787.64)"," to Kaleo it's not fatal we still have the governor can do a emergency declaration. So, and I'm certain he will continue to consult with us,",12775.36,12787.64
"(12787.64, 12790.2)", but that's just the current status.,12787.64,12790.2
"(12790.2, 12791.74)", So just be aware.,12790.2,12791.74
"(12791.74, 12794.22)"," I think the governor has until, is it June?",12791.74,12794.22
"(12794.22, 12797.0)", June 21st for veto.,12794.22,12797.0

"(12800.66, 12801.74)"," Okay, thank you.",12800.66,12801.74
"(12801.74, 12802.78)"," No, I just wanted to make sure",12801.74,12802.78
"(12802.78, 12804.1)", we're providing the full context.,12802.78,12804.1
"(12804.1, 12807.0)"," So this is one of the two, let's shift over to the second one.",12804.1,12807.0
"(12807.0, 12825.0)"," So the second bill that passed is hospital 153 did have a companion Senate bill 44 I think but possible 153 made it through. it sets a minimum fine of $50 and a maximum fine of $60,000",12807.0,12825.0
"(12826.64, 12830.16)", per violation per day of an order or decision,12826.64,12830.16
"(12830.16, 12833.66)", of the commission or any part of the water code.,12830.16,12833.66
"(12833.66, 12836.46)"," And so the intent, this was introduced, I think,",12833.66,12836.46
"(12836.46, 12838.54)"," by Senator Rhoads and a few others,",12836.46,12838.54
"(12838.54, 12841.06)", but Senator Rhoads has been focused,12838.54,12841.06
"(12841.06, 12848.72)", on this continuing offense clarification. So he in the bill it identifies,12841.06,12848.72
"(12848.72, 12856.48)", what it cons what constitutes a continuing offense. We recommended the increase in fine as,12848.72,12856.48
"(12856.48, 12861.36)", part of our testimony and it would ultimately meet it through the legislative process and this is to,12856.48,12861.36
"(12861.36, 12871.0)", mirror the department of health's violation amounts per the proposed step ups in the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Act shifts.,12861.36,12871.0
"(12872.0, 12886.88)"," But also, so it will create parity between us as a water quantity and kind of state water code regulator with the Department of Health's water quality and federal water kind of purveyor or regulator perspective.",12872.0,12886.88
"(12886.88, 12892.76)"," So that way, water in general, as a public trust resource is protected at equal levels.",12886.88,12892.76
"(12892.76, 12900.24)"," And there's basically a disincentive to, you know, not break the law, right and get the",12892.76,12900.24
"(12900.24, 12903.4)", required permits.,12900.24,12903.4
"(12903.4, 12907.6)", And then it obviously highlights the need that we have to make a,12903.4,12907.6
"(12907.6, 12914.32)", finding uh what the why we made the determination and established criteria and and and what the,12907.6,12914.32
"(12914.32, 12922.56)", severity of the fence is so again the the gap is big 50 to 60 000 is huge um but it does uh give,12914.32,12922.56
"(12922.56, 12927.36)", this body the commission the discretion and authority to to um levy based,12922.56,12927.36
"(12927.36, 12935.52)", on severity of this the case um this bill flew through the legislative process uh there was you,12927.36,12935.52
"(12935.52, 12942.24)", know support from Hawaii reef ocean coalition um initial opposition from an individual um at the,12935.52,12942.24
"(12942.24, 12945.84)", end through conference committee um there was opposition by lerf but other,12942.24,12945.84
"(12945.84, 12951.52)", than that there was no other testimony from any other agency individual throughout the entire,12945.84,12951.52
"(12951.52, 12959.28)", session um and and ultimately as you folks have been privy to is as violations come before this,12951.52,12959.28
"(12959.28, 12965.2)", commission there are those that willingly violate the code and those that don't and just they didn't know,12959.28,12965.2
"(12965.2, 12972.56)", any better and so this code as passed or this bill has passed provides still the discretion to the,12965.2,12972.56
"(12972.56, 12977.6)", commission to make that determination of whether the severity of the violation um and present,12972.56,12977.6
"(12977.6, 12982.16)", something to the commission for decision making so those are the two that that's this bill so those,12977.6,12982.16
"(12982.16, 12994.62)", are the two bills based on 153 tracking about 19 or 20 that we provide testimony on to made it through this legislative session on on policy and policy changes.,12982.16,12994.62
"(12996.5, 13000.0)", Any questions about though this this bill or statue.,12996.5,13000.0
"(13001.32, 13014.0)"," So again, these two bills week for governor's approval or the future next steps right there's various options that need to play out about by July, we should have a better understanding of of whether these become law or not.",13001.32,13014.0
"(13015.0, 13026.32)", A clay oh if this becomes so there isn't required rulemaking,13015.0,13026.32
"(13026.32, 13032.64)", um in the legislation um we do have and and that's a great question commissioner we do have a penalty,13026.32,13032.64
"(13032.64, 13038.56)", policy that the commission has approved to kind of outline severity outline criteria outline,13032.64,13038.56
"(13038.56, 13044.24)", is this a first-time thing or are you a habitual you know lawbreaker um which has really provided,13038.56,13044.24
"(13044.24, 13045.48)", the commission the ability,13044.24,13045.48
"(13045.48, 13046.68)"," to settle, right?",13045.48,13046.68
"(13046.68, 13048.28)", Like we can come up with alternatives,13046.68,13048.28
"(13048.28, 13050.48)", versus like a hard line violation.,13048.28,13050.48
"(13050.48, 13052.0)"," Once it gets into rules,",13050.48,13052.0
"(13052.0, 13055.68)", it becomes very non-discretionary.,13052.0,13055.68
"(13055.68, 13060.68)", So that wasn't included in this version of the statute.,13055.68,13060.68
"(13061.48, 13064.28)", So we have that flexibility.,13061.48,13064.28
"(13064.28, 13067.12)", And the goal is to bring back that water policy,13064.28,13067.12
"(13067.12, 13073.04)", that penalty policy to the commission to kind of reflect this new the new valuation um if the,13067.12,13073.04
"(13073.04, 13077.92)", commission wants to you know interrogate that a little bit more too or add additional criteria,13073.04,13077.92
"(13077.92, 13108.52)"," we welcome that as well um but that's hopefully in in maybe august or june july august we'll bring EAB – E And again, any violation, there is a due process. We work very closely with our AGs to make sure that we follow due process laws.",13077.92,13108.52
"(13109.08, 13113.9)"," If we are going to bring any violation to this body, there's usually a chance to cure.",13109.08,13113.9
"(13114.88, 13132.0)"," There's usually a notice that's provided, good faith effort. And ultimately, you know, our goal is to protect the resource. So if there's actually an impact to the resource that violation obviously would come before this commission body with, you know, higher fines or penalties.",13114.88,13132.0
"(13132.0, 13142.0)"," If there's not a severe penalty, then you won't see such high fines and penalties, but more so just a warning.",13132.0,13142.0
"(13142.0, 13145.36)"," And, you know, ultimately we're not here to make money off of people we want",13142.0,13145.36
"(13145.36, 13149.92)", just people to protect the resource and be good stewards of the resource but this tool gives us,13145.36,13149.92
"(13149.92, 13156.24)", ability to kind of help to incentivize or change behavior um in order to accomplish that goal,13149.92,13156.24
"(13158.48, 13163.44)", okay i'm going to shift from bills to budget real quick if that's okay with the this commission so,13158.48,13163.44
"(13164.4, 13166.88)", um i think it was in january again,13164.4,13166.88
"(13166.88, 13172.72)", pre-legislative session this is where we were at um so just kind of to recap what we had as a base,13166.88,13172.72
"(13172.72, 13179.12)", budget we had 27 positions 22 general funded five special funded and that's those are funded out of,13172.72,13179.12
"(13179.12, 13186.48)", the state land development fund um basically the revenues generated from the board's uh the land,13179.12,13186.48
"(13186.48, 13192.32)", division's use of um or leasing of lands throughout the state we had an operational budget of about 4.1,13186.48,13192.32
"(13192.32, 13199.92)", million um and then fortunately we've been really grateful and thankful that we've been getting two,13192.32,13199.92
"(13199.92, 13206.08)", million dollar allocation kind of annually um for the past at least four years to help continuing,13199.92,13206.08
"(13206.08, 13211.92)", our deep monitoring well development. So Erin did upon our stream gauging on the groundwater side,13206.08,13211.92
"(13211.92, 13217.68)", better understanding groundwater resources deep monitoring wells are where it's at and so we've,13211.92,13217.68
"(13217.68, 13222.4)", been asking for two million annually to at least continue to be able to develop the monitoring,13217.68,13222.4
"(13222.4, 13227.7)"," world statewide. So that was this is, this was our fiscal year 23,",13222.4,13227.7
"(13227.7, 13231.34)", AKA the current operating budget we're in now.,13227.7,13231.34
"(13231.34, 13234.52)"," This will end June 30th, 2023 this year.",13231.34,13234.52
"(13234.52, 13236.34)"," So this operational funds,",13234.52,13236.34
"(13236.34, 13239.1)"," and this is the limits that kind of Erin talked about, right?",13236.34,13239.1
"(13239.1, 13241.1)"," That we have so much,",13239.1,13241.1
"(13241.1, 13247.84)", most of this is for for personnel expensive staff um not our and then um that,13241.1,13247.84
"(13247.84, 13253.84)", one million in um about a million in our cooperative agreement the us geological survey,13247.84,13253.84
"(13253.84, 13258.32)", um so it leaves really little of discretionary funds for travel and other expenses,13253.84,13258.32
"(13259.04, 13268.64)", so moving forward where are fines and any other fees so fines fees application fees and fines come into um our,13259.04,13268.64
"(13268.64, 13275.68)", water resource management fund that's three three two six okay yeah so that that number there,13268.64,13275.68
"(13275.68, 13280.96)", three three hundred fifty six that's our our ceiling on that special fund so we can spend,13275.68,13280.96
"(13280.96, 13287.12)", up to that i i gotta look at what our current balance is in that um but that's where,13280.96,13287.12
"(13287.12, 13295.52)", any of the fines go or the application fees that we do get um from from wells and or stream diversion,13287.12,13295.52
"(13295.52, 13302.88)", permit applications uh one of the things to consider is you know our well construction and,13295.52,13302.88
"(13302.88, 13307.08)", pump installation permit fees are $300 to apply for.,13302.88,13307.08
"(13307.74, 13310.22)", And then our stream diversion and SCAPs are $25.,13307.74,13310.22
"(13311.02, 13320.98)"," So we do need to revisit those because the cost to evaluate those, to process them, are well beyond $25.",13311.02,13320.98
"(13322.08, 13327.48)", Even on the well side now with Kapapa'a Kai and the impact situation,13322.08,13327.48
"(13327.48, 13332.36)"," and customary practice, there's additional time and review that goes into it. So those",13327.48,13332.36
"(13332.36, 13336.3)"," fees are very minimal compared to the amount of staff time. So I don't even, we are definitely",13332.36,13336.3
"(13336.3, 13343.26)", not recouping our basic staff expenses just to process these permits. I understand that,13336.3,13343.26
"(13343.26, 13345.04)", there's a balance right anytime we increase application,13343.26,13345.04
"(13345.04, 13352.24)", fees there's push back um but though those definitely are are areas that we need to like,13345.04,13352.24
"(13352.24, 13362.4)", revisit in terms of um funding and sustainable funding for us okay um here's just our request,13352.24,13362.4
"(13362.4, 13365.84)", so i again this was prior we presented this in January.,13362.4,13365.84
"(13365.84, 13368.54)"," So in the EGA administration,",13365.84,13368.54
"(13368.54, 13371.18)"," we had four aquatic biologists approved,",13368.54,13371.18
"(13371.18, 13373.4)", but we're only half of the year.,13371.18,13373.4
"(13373.4, 13376.54)", This request asks for full funding.,13373.4,13376.54
"(13376.54, 13378.18)"," So this gets to your question about,",13376.54,13378.18
"(13378.18, 13379.86)"," Aaron, what's your team look like?",13378.18,13379.86
"(13379.86, 13384.86)"," So these four positions, I'm working with Dean to,",13379.86,13384.86
"(13386.8, 13391.58)"," they're gonna actually shift to general four positions, I'm working with Dean to, they're going to actually shifted general professional positions working with our human resources program, because that",13386.8,13391.58
"(13391.58, 13396.32)", better fits the position description and kind of what we need them for.,13391.58,13396.32
"(13396.32, 13401.82)"," But the idea is, is those four would help both on the in stream side, as well as our",13396.32,13401.82
"(13401.82, 13403.5)", permitting and regulation side.,13401.82,13403.5
"(13403.5, 13405.34)", So the other side that does a lot,13403.5,13405.34
"(13405.34, 13407.14)", of the permit review and compliance.,13405.34,13407.14
"(13408.16, 13410.62)", And we also asked again for 2 million each year,13408.16,13410.62
"(13410.62, 13415.42)", in fiscal year 24 and 25 in Governor Ige's budget.,13410.62,13415.42
"(13415.42, 13418.78)"," Moving forward in Governor Green, he issued,",13415.42,13418.78
"(13418.78, 13421.14)"," we made, there was a request for, you know,",13418.78,13421.14
"(13421.14, 13423.84)", any additional funds that we'd wanna ask for.,13421.14,13423.84
"(13423.84, 13428.84)", So we put in a request for new positions in groundwater,13423.84,13428.84
"(13429.1, 13429.96)"," and our survey branch,",13429.1,13429.96
"(13429.96, 13432.2)", and this was really to build out Ryan,13429.96,13432.2
"(13432.2, 13435.68)", and the groundwater team in order to really support,13432.2,13435.68
"(13435.68, 13437.76)"," the added workload from Red Hill,",13435.68,13437.76
"(13437.76, 13441.86)", as well as some of the longer term groundwater research,13437.76,13441.86
"(13441.86, 13443.98)", that we need to focus on.,13441.86,13443.98
"(13443.98, 13447.8)", What we also asked for was increases to our base budget.,13443.98,13447.8
"(13447.8, 13450.24)"," And this gets to, and this is really,",13447.8,13450.24
"(13450.24, 13451.44)"," I frame it in the context,",13450.24,13451.44
"(13451.44, 13454.54)"," these are really climate related types of research,",13451.44,13454.54
"(13454.54, 13456.04)"," Chair, that you had asked.",13454.54,13456.04
"(13456.04, 13459.7)"," So getting to what Erin was saying,",13456.04,13459.7
"(13459.7, 13463.36)"," we asked for a $250,000 increase to our base,",13459.7,13463.36
"(13464.5, 13468.64)", and that's to allow us to add five gauges a year to basically,13464.5,13468.64
"(13468.64, 13473.84)", add an additional five gauges with USGS to our cooperative agreement so we can continue to build,13468.64,13473.84
"(13473.84, 13479.52)", out this data set but that requires an increase to our base because this is not a one-time cost it's,13473.84,13479.52
"(13479.52, 13485.84)", one time and operational over time in order for us to continue and get that longitudinal data.,13479.52,13485.84
"(13491.92, 13494.0)"," Similarly, what was great is a bill came up about LIMU research, but we had asked for about $250,000",13491.92,13494.0
"(13499.12, 13506.7)"," and to continue the work with UH on their work in Kona to better understand LIMU, especially LIMU that are reliant on groundwater flow for production to take that to Molokai,",13499.12,13506.7
"(13506.7, 13509.46)", because that is where a lot of the original water law,13506.7,13509.46
"(13509.46, 13511.22)"," and water case law came out,",13509.46,13511.22
"(13511.22, 13513.22)", where there's a need for us to better understand,13511.22,13513.22
"(13513.22, 13515.24)", the balance between pump withdrawal,13513.22,13515.24
"(13515.24, 13517.18)", and the discharge along the coast,13515.24,13517.18
"(13517.18, 13520.46)", to support tradition customer across designated points.,13517.18,13520.46
"(13520.46, 13524.44)", And we also asked for funding to the Hau'i Mesa Net.,13520.46,13524.44
"(13524.44, 13529.16)", Not all of these got into Governor Green's GMs,13524.44,13529.16
"(13529.16, 13531.9)"," to the legislature, but these again were asked",13529.16,13531.9
"(13531.9, 13532.74)", in the budget.,13531.9,13532.74
"(13532.74, 13536.32)"," So fast forward three, four months later,",13532.74,13536.32
"(13536.32, 13538.02)", this is where we ended.,13536.32,13538.02
"(13538.02, 13540.2)"," So I'm super grateful for this,",13538.02,13540.2
"(13540.2, 13543.6)"," but we managed to get some of the ask in, you know,",13540.2,13543.6
"(13543.6, 13545.84)", working with WAM especially uh Senator,13543.6,13545.84
"(13545.84, 13551.76)", Dela Cruz's office they've been super supportive of supporting the commission and our needs um,13545.84,13551.76
"(13552.48, 13557.6)", so we added six positions to the water commission this past session that's basically an increase of,13552.48,13557.6
"(13557.6, 13570.0)"," 30 about 30 percent um what I did was I actually over since 1988 we've been pretty much static at about 15 to 20 staff for the past 30 years, and then we've gotten a huge bump.",13557.6,13570.0
"(13570.0, 13586.4)"," Last year we got four for aquatic biologists, or last administration this initial biennium we got additional six positions so four positions are going to going to groundwater regulation, really to help with the work added workload and support and",13570.0,13586.4
"(13586.4, 13591.36)", and coordination with department of health on red hill this is not going away anytime soon,13586.4,13591.36
"(13591.36, 13598.96)", related to the long-term aquifer remediation again our focus is aquifer health um and getting it,13591.36,13598.96
"(13598.96, 13612.08)", and managing it in the long term defueling is one thing department of health is managing that but we want to make sure that um future water use and the aquifer use of that aquifer um that that's remedied and that,13598.96,13612.08
"(13612.08, 13617.92)", we have some kind of understanding of what that future looks like so um but also one of the things,13612.08,13617.92
"(13617.92, 13624.32)", that we do know in as part of this is better understanding um the current water use allocations,13617.92,13624.32
"(13624.32, 13625.92)", throughout the island of oahu and,13624.32,13625.92
"(13625.92, 13631.44)", actually throughout the state in management areas um and in a review of some of those allocations,13625.92,13631.44
"(13631.44, 13636.0)", because there's been some that people have quote unquote sat on the commission has brought it up,13631.44,13636.0
"(13636.0, 13642.0)", um prior is there's a review of non-use we've issued allocations but people haven't used it,13636.0,13642.0
"(13642.0, 13646.18)", so why aren't we rescinding that the commission has authority to do it? What,13642.0,13646.18
"(13646.18, 13648.56)"," are the main issue and what working with staff has been,",13646.18,13648.56
"(13648.76, 13652.06)"," they've said, it's been a limit of resources and priorities. So",13648.76,13652.06
"(13652.06, 13656.0)", this these positions came with that intent to have us focus in,13652.06,13656.0
"(13656.0, 13659.92)", on the end use allocation evaluation. So that's kind of,13656.0,13659.92
"(13659.92, 13662.76)", the goal is to get these four positions moving on those types,13659.92,13662.76
"(13662.76, 13665.98)", of things. And then also tied to the,13662.76,13665.98
"(13665.98, 13673.92)"," water penalty bill, House Bill 153. Throughout the session, we had said, you know, if with the",13665.98,13673.92
"(13673.92, 13680.34)"," increased focus on compliance and enforcement, we don't really have focus on that portion. A lot of",13673.92,13680.34
"(13680.34, 13685.26)"," times staff manage that on top of their, you know, normal other work.",13680.34,13685.26
"(13685.26, 13688.24)"," So we asked for two positions and those will,",13685.26,13688.24
"(13688.24, 13690.76)", we're looking at putting them in planning office,13688.24,13690.76
"(13690.76, 13692.86)", to help support our groundwater,13690.76,13692.86
"(13692.86, 13694.32)", and our surface water branches,13692.86,13694.32
"(13694.32, 13696.54)"," in water compliance and enforcement,",13694.32,13696.54

"(13702.84, 13705.74)", or water use permit condition and allocation.,13702.84,13705.74
"(13705.74, 13707.56)", So six new positions got added.,13705.74,13707.56
"(13707.56, 13711.5)", So now we're out of the 20s and into the 30s,13707.56,13711.5
"(13711.5, 13712.74)", for the Water Commission.,13711.5,13712.74
"(13713.98, 13716.72)"," Again, just one of the things I try to remind people,",13713.98,13716.72
"(13716.72, 13718.5)", we have a statewide purview.,13716.72,13718.5
"(13718.5, 13721.08)", We have 33 positions for water.,13718.5,13721.08
"(13721.08, 13727.18)"," The larger department has a thousand positions as a right. So when we look at equity,",13721.08,13727.18
"(13727.18, 13732.72)"," I'm a constant advocate if we can't live without water, but we still have a long way to go",13727.18,13732.72
"(13732.72, 13737.68)"," and advocating for resources to really do our job and do it well, for the benefit of",13732.72,13737.68
"(13737.68, 13742.98)", the public trust and the people who wait. So the shifts are there below and the majority,13737.68,13742.98
"(13742.98, 13747.8)", of the operational budget increase from the 4.1 to 4.5 and then ultimately 4.8,13742.98,13747.8
"(13747.8, 13755.38)", come with those six positions. There really wasn't an increase in a base budget for expenses or travel.,13747.8,13755.38
"(13756.08, 13772.1)"," So now that we've gotten the position next biennium or supplemental year, we'll probably ask for additional funding to support Aaron and his work, Ryan and, you know, the team with Red Hill and them doing and getting out in the field working compliance, etc.",13756.08,13772.1
"(13772.34, 13778.52)", There's going to be a need to ask for increase just expense expenses to cover expenses.,13772.34,13778.52
"(13778.94, 13785.68)", And then we did also get 2 million each year in fiscal year 24 and 25 for deep monitoring wealth development statewide,13778.94,13785.68
"(13785.68, 13792.32)", so ultimately we we did really well I think for the water commission in our operating NCIP budgets,13785.68,13792.32
"(13793.12, 13799.84)", as well as some of the policy additions that will help us to do our job and continue you know be,13793.12,13799.84
"(13799.84, 13805.94)", better stewards of this resource so with that I think that's a good enough summary,13799.84,13805.94
"(13805.94, 13807.18)", for now on our legislative-,13805.94,13807.18

"(13838.32, 13845.32)", kaleo and team do we have the capacity to accept philanthropy? Yes.,13838.32,13845.32
"(13846.44, 13847.12)", Yes.,13846.44,13847.12
"(13847.42, 13847.66)", Yes.,13847.42,13847.66
"(13848.16, 13851.24)", So have we thought about that at all?,13848.16,13851.24
"(13851.36, 13862.58)"," Is there any bandwidth, the leadership to think about some of the sources we might tap to get a significant gift to take care of a precious resource?",13851.36,13862.58

"(13868.0, 13873.24)", I haven't been able to strategize or come up with the time really to frame,13868.0,13873.24
"(13873.24, 13875.08)", what is the ask.,13873.24,13875.08
"(13875.08, 13877.72)", We definitely know the budget needs.,13875.08,13877.72
"(13877.72, 13882.16)", I ultimately I think the closest we've focused,13877.72,13882.16
"(13882.16, 13897.0)"," is the Freshwater Council with the boycott petition. And and it's not necessarily us accepting the philanthropic support, but it's really to support others in the community, whether a water purveyor or private agricultural system just becoming",13882.16,13897.0
"(13897.0, 13905.0)"," better stewards that sometimes is even better if it's given to out that way, then it to come directly to the Water Commission as a State agency.",13897.0,13905.0
"(13905.0, 13911.0)", We oftentimes have more strings than anything else right to to accomplish that ultimate goal.,13905.0,13911.0

"(13947.88, 13949.82)", we're gonna get quite a substantial amount,13947.88,13949.82
"(13949.82, 13951.78)", of federal funding from support,13949.82,13951.78
"(13951.78, 13954.94)", from our entire congressional delegation this year.,13951.78,13954.94

"(13963.92, 13966.24)", with federal funds to basically double almost,13963.92,13966.24
"(13966.24, 13974.88)", triple down um on our resources and then um to help us to support us in other um water audit and,13966.24,13974.88
"(13974.88, 13981.6)", well abandonment programs so that's really where i think our core is versus philanthropic funding,13974.88,13981.6
"(13981.6, 13991.36)", um but on the philanthropic there's a big push you know migration from just funding worthy activity to funding impact and transformation you can't know,13981.6,13991.36
"(13991.36, 13996.16)", your impact if you're not measuring so when we think about some of the gauging and the,13991.36,13996.16
"(13997.12, 14002.08)", and the expense of that putting in that system and maintaining it and getting the data and analyzing,13997.12,14002.08
"(14002.08, 14006.28)", it there might be some room there. So just a thought.,14002.08,14006.28
"(14006.28, 14009.92)", I will welcome your expertise in the philanthropic center,14006.28,14009.92
"(14009.92, 14012.78)", on how best maybe we could approach that.,14009.92,14012.78
"(14012.78, 14015.3)", Happy to chat with you and the team about it,14012.78,14015.3
"(14015.3, 14018.54)", and connect with some other people who know more about it.,14015.3,14018.54
"(14018.54, 14020.62)"," And Neil, that was one of the purposes",14018.54,14020.62
"(14020.62, 14029.42)"," behind the governor's, the green fee. That was to create a vehicle for philanthropic",14020.62,14029.42

"(14048.58, 14053.38)"," I think for the first time, the legislators really",14048.58,14053.38
"(14053.38, 14058.42)"," understood that DLNR has lapped capacity,",14053.38,14058.42
"(14058.42, 14064.58)", but they have exceeded expectations in many ways.,14058.42,14064.58
"(14064.58, 14074.2)"," So at the end of session or at the close, the budget bill, they were quite generous",14064.58,14074.2

"(14081.28, 14087.28)", So we are working on that but there are some other very major policy initiatives that,14081.28,14087.28
"(14087.28, 14095.12)", have an impact to dll as well but i did want to cover a few things because the um the water,14087.28,14095.12
"(14095.12, 14108.72)", commission in light of red hill has really kind of pushed us all to look at better coordination between agencies government entities so i do want to provide you an update,14095.12,14108.72
"(14109.36, 14118.0)", that over the last month there's been some major initiatives um that have um for that have come,14109.36,14118.0
"(14118.0, 14125.36)", as a result of both the collective as well and in particular red hill so i think you might have heard about,14118.0,14125.36
"(14125.36, 14133.52)", two weeks ago through legislative leadership and the governor's office and the sitting county of,14125.36,14133.52
"(14133.52, 14145.0)"," honolulu there was a press conference on a unified statement in support of not only the cleanup of Red Hill,",14133.52,14145.0
"(14146.16, 14150.96)", but the assurance of clean fresh water for the future.,14146.16,14150.96
"(14150.96, 14155.96)", So this unified statement is a launch of a collective body,14150.96,14155.96
"(14156.5, 14161.5)", of government representatives from both the governor's,14156.5,14161.5
"(14161.68, 14169.3)"," office, the administration, as well as the legislature, and the city and county of Honolulu to hold the Navy accountable.",14161.68,14169.3
"(14170.74, 14177.94)", And so all of these agencies bring individual Kuleana responsibilities or expertise.,14170.74,14177.94
"(14177.94, 14188.26)", And this is a desire to ensure that nothing's falling through the gap. So this group will continue to meet probably,14177.94,14188.26
"(14188.26, 14192.94)", over the next four months to come up with strategies,14188.26,14192.94
"(14192.94, 14196.84)"," to address not only again, the cleanup,",14192.94,14196.84
"(14196.84, 14199.4)", but the future sustainability to ensure,14196.84,14199.4
"(14199.4, 14201.62)", there's fresh clean water for the people,14199.4,14201.62
"(14201.62, 14203.32)", of City and County of Honolulu.,14201.62,14203.32

"(14209.0, 14235.0)"," Governor Green has established the governor's water council made up of different representatives of which both Kaleo and I, Department of Health, the AG's office, Department of Ag, D. Hhl sit with the governors and talking about water water issues statewide.",14209.0,14235.0
"(14235.0, 14248.24)", So that's a current initiative that's also going on and then there is as Kaleo mentioned the HF's Water Alliance. So Kaleo sits on it and I'm going to now join that.,14235.0,14248.24
"(14249.28, 14257.68)"," The last thing is, you know, I got a call from Ernie Lau who wants to meet with us on a monthly",14249.28,14257.68

"(14266.0, 14278.76)"," So I think that there is a, there are numerous efforts to ensure that there is better government coordination on water.",14266.0,14278.76
"(14279.18, 14287.64)"," Water is obviously a priority. I think everyone recognizes in light of Red Hill, the vulnerability and",14279.18,14287.64
"(14287.64, 14299.2)"," the fragility of our resource and how we need to we can no longer operate in isolation,",14287.64,14299.2
"(14299.2, 14306.08)"," but we have to work in collaboration. So I mean, I think that there's a lot of good things things that the water",14299.2,14306.08
"(14306.08, 14315.04)", commission has been asking for and you know i know that mike and aurora and all of you have just been,14306.08,14315.04
"(14315.04, 14319.76)", pushing about you know we need to get we need to get this under better control so,14315.04,14319.76
"(14321.44, 14330.0)", i think there is a movement by government to recognize we have to do better as government.,14321.44,14330.0
"(14330.0, 14337.0)", So Mahalo to the Water Commission to really pushing a lot of those limits and initiatives.,14330.0,14337.0
"(14337.0, 14347.5)", But I think the legislature and the governor's office and the city and county of Honolulu recognize we all have to work together,14337.0,14347.5
"(14347.5, 14355.1)", on this. So that's kind of a summary of both the legislative and then the policymakers wanting to,14347.5,14355.1
"(14355.1, 14368.5)"," have a better coordinated effort. Red Hill can happen again, and it can happen anywhere. We could have a storm, we could have a natural disaster",14355.1,14368.5
"(14368.5, 14370.52)", that exposes our system.,14368.5,14370.52
"(14370.52, 14375.22)", So I think we need to be in a better position.,14370.52,14375.22
"(14375.22, 14378.72)"," So mahalo to the Water Commission and the staff,",14375.22,14378.72

"(14397.34, 14406.0)", question yeah hi as as presented in the workload and some of the legislative initiatives as you,14397.34,14406.0
"(14407.12, 14413.84)", increase your staffing to comprehend all the duties that need to be accomplished,14407.12,14413.84
"(14414.56, 14430.16)", will you continue to be oahu-centric it seems that a lot of the work are outside of that you're right you're you're absolutely right um you know wayne and i have,14414.56,14430.16
"(14430.16, 14437.68)", as a matter of just policy and leadership here at dlnr i am really trying to empower,14430.16,14437.68
"(14438.56, 14445.84)", our island staff we are being criticized by the community for being O'ahu centric.,14438.56,14445.84
"(14446.4, 14453.84)"," So I have told all of our island staff, whether you're land division, DOFA, DOBAR, DAR,",14446.4,14453.84
"(14454.8, 14459.66)"," we, one, we have to, and I'm trying to get everybody out of silos.",14454.8,14459.66
"(14460.1, 14466.16)"," So whenever an issue comes up, we are triaging with all of the different divisions so that everybody",14460.1,14466.16
"(14466.16, 14474.88)", is putting in their manao but we are also at the same time trying to build capacity within our,14466.16,14474.88
"(14474.88, 14481.76)", neighbor islands as well so that um because travel is you know we learned that through covid i mean,14474.88,14481.76
"(14481.76, 14486.16)", we have to have capacity on each of these islands to support us so,14481.76,14486.16
"(14487.12, 14496.48)", we are trying i am trying consciously to build that capacity on each of the islands so that we,14487.12,14496.48
"(14496.48, 14508.08)", are supporting each other i'm also trying to do multiple within the divisions how can we you know when an issue comes up how can we share information,14496.48,14508.08
"(14508.64, 14517.6)", resources um knowledge to be much more effective if i can also add chair so um of the aquatic,14508.64,14517.6
"(14517.6, 14522.96)", biologists that we talked about two of them will be on um will be on maui with the workload that,14517.6,14522.96
"(14522.96, 14526.64)", aaron shared and the amount of stream work that we do have on maui that'll be the first that will be on Maui with the workload that Erin shared and the amount of stream work that we do have on,14522.96,14526.64
"(14526.64, 14532.1)", Maui that'll be the first that would be the first sea worm shift to out of out of Honolulu,14526.64,14532.1
"(14532.1, 14537.36)", which I will say is a culture shock for an institution that's only been Oahu centric so,14532.1,14537.36
"(14537.36, 14546.34)"," I am working with staff to make sure that we have the communication in place, the support systems built, but like other divisions that",14537.36,14546.34
"(14546.34, 14551.66)", do have base yards outside of O'ahu is to really look outward and see where we can do that.,14546.34,14551.66
"(14551.9, 14557.58)"," Another thing that we're looking at is as we start to unveil and look at options, maybe even for some",14551.9,14557.58
"(14557.58, 14562.3)"," of the planners or compliance people, if we can actually recruit from the Outer Islands where",14557.58,14562.3
"(14562.3, 14565.36)", there's a need for more jobs um and provide,14562.3,14565.36
"(14565.36, 14571.68)", teleworking which is now kind of an option that's evolved postcode as an incentive uh to get and,14565.36,14571.68
"(14571.68, 14575.36)", recruit really good quality staff because some people don't want to be on a walk where they want,14571.68,14575.36
"(14575.36, 14581.36)", to stay in kauai or maui or big island um we're still working through the complexities of dherd,14575.36,14581.36
"(14581.36, 14586.56)", and our hr process to make that happen but yes i am having coming from the neighbor,14581.36,14586.56
"(14586.56, 14593.44)", island um we we are looking at ways to provide a diverse kind of approach to our management and,14586.56,14593.44
"(14593.44, 14606.94)"," regulation so yes yes no and and we're also trying to um i am trying we spend a disproportionate amount of our time on litigation, contested case hearings, court cases.",14593.44,14606.94
"(14608.06, 14615.72)"," So our leadership team, Kaleo, Laura Ka'akua, and myself,",14608.06,14615.72
