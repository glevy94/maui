Briefing on the Status of West Maui Water Use Permit Applications Regarding Honokōwai Aquifer System by Commission Staff
PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Deputy Dean Uyeno
Staff provided an update on the process for groundwater and surface water permits in Honokōwai, Honolua, and Honokōhau Hydrologic Units.
Where is Puʻukoliʻi?
Puʻukoliʻi, so in the next map this is kind of all the developments that either have been completed, are on the books or are being proposed or in the process.
Your prior slides were existing users?
What was that again?
Existing users, the prior slide.
The prior slide, yes, these are all the existing applications that came.
Did you clarify that with the Land Use Commission? They had not submitted an application.
I believe she was going to, I can't recall exactly our email communication but she said, got it.
We're being blamed for a non-existent application? DEPUTY UYENO: Yeah.
That satisfies the immediate issue before us, but the larger issue is that's a lot of uses for a small amount of water. Where will the Commission be going with that, balancing there?
That's why we're focusing our efforts on Honokōwai first, especially since it's all ground water. We don't really have the complexities of dealing with the ground and surface water interactions and then when once we get there, then we'll move back up north towards Honokōhau, Honolua, and then start making our way south. After Honokōwai, we will start getting to the complexities of ground and surface water. There's the major diversion from Honokōhau is there which feeds municipal uses for both private and public developments.
Any progress on the county side with the treatment of the wastewater?
I'm not sure where we last left it, but I think they are more serious about it, but nothing that we've been apprised to.
They’ve got other things on their plate. How does our Maui temp housing, the water that's being used for Maui temp housing fold into...because we've been saying if it's an existing use, we've been permitting it. If it's a new use, you've got to wait for our water management process.
Correct, as of now close to all of the developments are being fed by the County. Those that may be fed by private are currently on hold and so until we get more information, we are moving forward with that. The only one is a small project which Hawaiʻi Water Service, I think it's only 50 homes on the golf course where they're building the temp housing for the workers. That's the only thing we need to assess.
I think Commissioner Miike’s concern about, we're going to have a lot more challenges in this designation. We're just not going to have enough and I'm really worried about where we're going to...You’ve got so many different moving parts with the EP, the Maui temp housing, and the restoration of Lahaina.
When is your vacation planned? Pardon me, that was really unfair. You're doing great, you really are.
To Alexa's credit, when the whole admin bill thing came up, she was looking at the State Water Code review and I think was that the ’86? Back then they did recognize that the water shortage issues in West Maui and so back then they were already contemplating designation and we're in this situation now.
That doesn't make me feel any better.          
Dean, from what you know about this project in the back of the envelope, what do you think the water requirement is going to be?
At Puʻukoliʻi?
Yes.
I have no idea, I can't recall what the...
That's a new use, too, right?
They have a master plan for the development, so I'm sure it's on the book somewhere. I just haven't looked at it closely.
That would give you sort of an idea of what the pressure is going to look like literally.
I think that's where the reuse is going to be very important because that may free up a lot of water that would otherwise be used for irrigation.
I'm out of touch a bit but with respect, you asked the question about the water reuse plan from the Lahaina treatment plant and my understanding is R1's been available for quite a while, like three years now. It's been used primarily along the coast for irrigation, production of the treatment plant. Negotiations are continuing for acquisition of a larger reservoir further up the hill that will provide distribution of the R1 water, wider spectrum. Of course it would have to be pumped up to Puʻukoliʻi to be used up there, but that's project cost. It's my understanding that negotiations are continuing and they're headed in the right direction with respect to acquisition of an old ag reservoir. It's still in use, in pretty good shape and that would solve a lot of the distribution and reuse questions.
There's a map on the County website that does show their plans going up to that higher reservoir.
My connection might be a little unstable. I just wanted to offer a little bright spot at least for me is that the Water Resources Research Center, we've got a lot of new faculty coming in including a drinking water specialist. We have wastewater - very energetic and in a second year wastewater specialist. I hope we can really build some stronger bridges with the agencies and take advantage of that. I don't want to throw Emily under the bus, but she's done potable reuse in different places on the continent. I hope just knowing that there are specialists at UH, I hope they can inform that really important work.
I really have a lot of catching up to do with regards to the situation in West Maui and in particular my interest is the R1 use. I’m sorry, Fred, is that your name tag? It's very hard to read on Zoom. It was very educational for me, I'm making some contacts there in Maui. I come from agriculture and I'm working with my brother in the Kuʻia area and the lack of water for agriculture is such an issue and so I'm just moving home and I'm trying to get caught up on where things are at, where the process is for bringing the R1 water farther south, hopefully. I’m trying to just get in the rooms where sometimes this is being talked about and explore who's been working on this, who's trying to help make this happen or what are the obstacles and if there are ways that I can kōkua to try to have it move forward. Not that I swing any big sticks, but I've got a lot of energy and I'm very passionate about this subject and agriculture and the community in Lahaina and West Maui and the environment. You'll probably see me more and I think it'll always be friendly, so don't worry. I just know the water wars have been going on in West Maui for a very long time. The fact that we haven't figured it out, how to utilize more of this R1 water that's been such a wasted resource, in my opinion, for so long is too bad and we can't let it continue. I think this is a great turning point and opportunity to especially with all of the interest for how can we improve things in Lahaina for climate resilience, for fuel load, for wildfire mitigation, for climate change resilience, all of the above reasons- the R1 kind of seems like a natural good candidate. That's where my interest is and I'm just trying to learn and trying to understand the history and the current status of things and looking for opportunities to maybe have conversations and try to move it forward or see if there's ways that we can help whoever's been trying to move it forward, to overcome whatever obstacles might be in the way.
We thank you for joining us today, thank you very much.
I’m here, I'm John Helly. My background is as a scientist in oceanography, Earth sciences and geophysics, sort of topics. I've been a resident of Maui for 23 years plus and currently a member of the Board of Water Supply. I'm not speaking for the Board of Water Supply, I'm not representing any points of view in that regard. I was here to understand the timing of the review process for the permits because despite what I just said, I'm a chair of a temporary investigative group for the Board of Water Supply and it's important to our planning as to when we expect to see these somewhere between 100 and 200 permit applications in order to review them effectively. However, I think the presentation by Dean addressed my main concern which is trying to get a status of the timing of all that and I'll just leave you with a comment that we have a meeting on Thursday that's going to be at least partially addressing some of the issues that were just under discussion and I'd encourage anyone interested to pay attention to that meeting, thank you.
Thank you very much, John. Dean, what is your schedule for this?
We were hoping to start bringing at least these applications to you for Honokōwai later this year, the end of this year. That's the hope. We're starting to get the letters out now, most if not all of them should go out this week and again this is just for Honokōwai Aquifer. 30 days for them to get the information back to us at which point we can initiate the public review and public notice process.
There's also an opportunity for filing a contested case?
Well, the public notice will go out. If there are objections, we'll have to hold a public hearing. I believe at that point during the public hearing process, people could request a contested case hearing or when it gets brought before the Commission, there’s another opportunity.
Dean, if you think of it, reach out and let me know when those public hearings are and what the site are? I’d like to follow that along. Thanks very much.
That probably would be a good idea to have a Commission presence, too, since this is one of the first.
I was just going to ask Mr. Helly, he mentioned the meeting that was upcoming, if he can share those details verbally with us.
Just a moment, details of the schedule for the meeting? 
Yeah, you said there was a meeting this week.
Yes, there's a meeting on Thursday, our monthly board meeting at 1:30 in the afternoon and there's an agenda published and it's on the County website. You can look for the Board of Water Supply and that'll lead you hopefully to the agenda. If you require more, I'd be happy to send the link.
Commissioner Hannahs shares his closing remarks; he will be completing his tenure as Commissioner on June 30, 2024.
Chair Chang, mahalo for affording me this opportunity to share some parting thoughts as I approach the conclusion of two terms of service on this Commission. After reading transcripts of the minutes of our meetings over the past eight years and finding the record of my remarks to be far more disjointed than what I had in mind, I am submitting this written version of my manaʻo to supplement my oral comments. The opportunity to assume a role in assuring the stewardship and availability of a life- enabling resource is a profound honor. I am grateful to Governor Ige for nominating me and to our State Senators for confirming my appointment. Thanks, as well, to Chairs Case and Chang, for guiding our work and to my fellow Commissioners who have been patient with my questions, respectful of my worldview and considerate of my positions. We have had a lot to do and owning to yeomen’s efforts of our dedicated staff, we have had full agendas. I observed this tone being set at the top when I visited Deputy Director Manuel one day. Kaleo had a white board on his wall that counted down the number of meetings that would occur under his watch because he believed that each meeting represented an opportunity to address the myriad issues before us. I took inspiration from his mission-driven mindset, and I am proud of what we have accomplished by working together with a sense of urgency. Our business has covered a wide range of issues and I found it beneficial to be collaborating with colleagues who bring diverse skills and experiences to each topic. • Impacts of climate change on rainfall, water recharge and sustainable yield. • Domestic requirements, well development, conservation and drought planning. • Pollution risks and the Red Hill crisis. • Wastewater treatment and dual system benefits. • Water Management Area designation. • Stream and marine biology, watersheds, biodiversity. • Cultural practices, kuleana rights and Ka Paʻakai analysis. • Sustainable food system goals, transmission efficiencies and reservoir storage. • Instream flow standards and riparian ecosystem services. • Permit streamlining and enforcement challenges. • Sunshine requirements, civic engagement and integration of stakeholder views. Some of the achievements that I found particularly gratifying include: • Resolving contested case disputes in East Maui, Nā Wai ʻEhā and Waimea, Kauaʻi that set instream flow standards and provided resources for off-stream use. • Gaining the Navy’s acceptance of responsibility for draining and repurposing Red Hill fuel tanks and remediating our ground water resources. • Designating Maui Komohana as a Water Management Area. • Returning water to Molokaʻi’s Kawela Stream. • Creating protocols that intensify our commitment to Ka Paʻakai analysis. In my humble opinion, our efforts to accomplish these and other successful outcomes were benefited by four factors. •A community that rises to the duty of civic engagement in a democratic system and shows up with knowledge of the topic, respect for the process and aloha ʻāina motivating their resolve. The work of staff who have diligently researched issues, consulted stakeholders and crafted policy-aligned recommendations for our consideration. Commissioners who draw upon their knowledge, experience and problem-solving tools to resolve disputes, balance beneficial interests and fulfill our duties. A humble perspective that elevates public trust considerations over our self- interests or the concerns of specific constituencies. My reflections on our efforts to manage Hawaiʻi’s cherished wai resources are in stark contrast to the adage that “whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting.” That might be what they do elsewhere, but I do not think that characterizes our philosophy over the past eight years. Nor do I believe it will help you as you tackle the work that lies ahead. By now, we should all have learned that conflict divides communities, impedes action, depletes natural resources and confounds financial viability. Our ancestral wisdom of ola i ka wai enlightens a more prudent path. Water is not something we should fight to own and control for our singular use. It is what we must sustainably manage to create the conditions we need to survive today and for generations to come. I will miss the work of the Commission and I will miss all of you. Part of me would like to continue, but I also realize that our community is blessed with a deep bench of Hawaiian cultural practitioners who can bring insights and values that are essential to your future deliberations and efforts to uphold the principles of Hawaiʻi’s Water Code. I hope the Governor expeditiously appoints a worthy successor with these qualities so that the Commission can “e pūpūkahi i holomua kākou!” Mahalo nui and aloha nō!
