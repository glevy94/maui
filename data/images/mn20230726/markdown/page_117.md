whether it's sustainable because it depends on how much the water managers, and I'm thinking that's you, that's the water commission, how much of the consequence of doing that you are willing to accept. Because we saw that by doing those scenarios, we saw that it caused the freshwater lens to get thinner, it caused some streams to go -- to have less stream discharge, some springs to have lower discharge. So is that an acceptable -- without the answer to what's acceptable, it's virtually impossible for the scientists to tell you how much is available.

COMMISSIONER MIIKE: So you're saying, then, that we decide sustainable yield when we start seeing negative effects? Because, you know, when I was on the water commission, we had sort of crude models for figuring out what sustainable yield or -- was it Mink and -- I can't remember.

(Inaudible comments.)

COMMISSIONER MIIKE: So are we still -- if we're still dependent on that and the only way that we would change the sustainable yield is if we start seeing -- we're topping off and we're gonna start seeing negative effects like we did on the â€˜Iao Aquifer on Maui a couple of decades ago. So -- oh, okay.
