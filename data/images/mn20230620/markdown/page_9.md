CHAIR CHANG: Good morning.  
MS. ROTH: -- Commissioners. Katie Roth, Planning Branch of the commission. Item B-1 is the adoption of the Maui Island Water Use Development Plan for incorporation in the Hawai ªi Water Plan. You may remember a few months ago, back in March, staff gave an overview of the (inaudible) submittal and the plan itself, so in the interest of time, I'm not going to go into the details that were presented then. That is available; that recording is available on the website.
