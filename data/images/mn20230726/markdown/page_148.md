my words are not coming together. I'm a little tired. So basically, why is there not more aggressive reduction of per capita water use in the plan?

MR. USAGAWA: It would -- we were tying the reduction in per capita based on the amount of supply that we thought we would have, and so what we did in the -- in our water research foundation study, we took the -- the USGS recharge rates and -- applied that to the UH 2100 forecast, the rainfall forecast, right? One wet, one -- dynamical was wet; statistical was dry. And we -- and then we calculated roughly what the sustainable yields would be in both scenarios, yeah. So in the low -- I mean, in the dry scenario, the sustainable yields dropped by something in the range of 30 percent, and so reducing the amount of supply available to East Honolulu, we felt that bringing it down to 130 per capita would be sufficient for the demand to -- to, you know, align with the -- what we think the supply may be. 

Now, these scenarios that's 80 years away, and there's gonna be other, you know, evaluations of sustainable yield. There are other -- there are other cities that can go to a hundred per capita. And, in fact, when you see primarily center, because of the density, we think we can go down to a hundred. But in East Honolulu, there's a lot of large properties, a lot of swimming pools up there, so it's harder to get it lower. But if you can get the golf course off the
