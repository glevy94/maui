Summary of Hydrologic Conditions, Instream Values, and Surface Water Uses in the Surface Water Hydrologic Unit of Waikoloa (8161), Hawai‘i Island
PRESENTATION GIVEN BY: Dr. Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Branch Staff presented a general summary of conditions in the Waikoloa Surface Water Hydrologic Unit on Hawaiʻi Island.
Is Hawaiʻi DWS online? I was curious about that, there must be reasons when and why they rely on those wells and better understanding. I’m curious about how they manage their system and balance all the sources. Two, with the alternative source just on the other side, if you look on the leeward side there’s that use, but that area also feeds Waipiʻo, right? My recollection is that the Hāmākua Ditch dewatered Hiʻilawe and so the implications of thinking about when we move an alternative, already creating potential other issues on the other side.
I go into this in the IFSAR (Instream Flow Standard Assessment Report), but I didn’t want to go into too much detail in this presentation. The Commission is currently monitoring both ditch systems for the Department of Agriculture. We have a good working relationship with people on the ground. We’re not talking about dewatering an entire stream as an alternative, we’re talking about when needed, divert some of the water from the Upper Hāmākua Ditch into this reservoir. The Upper Hāmākua Ditch has the available capacity, it’s already diverting water. Department of Agriculture utilizes only about 1 MGD of what’s diverted, it just gets moved through the system. I know from experience on the ground and previous DLNR Water Commission reports about the Lower Hāmākua Ditch that there is substantially more water diverted than is utilized on a daily basis. That is simply because there’s leakage loss, there’s a lot of homesteads that are maybe taking water from the ditch that nobody knew about. If you saw how much water was delivered to the Paʻauilo Reservoir at the end of the Lower Hāmākua Ditch, you’d be astounded at how much water was diverted out of Waipiʻo Stream. The issue isn’t with the Upper Hāmākua Ditch, it’s with the Lower Hāmākua Ditch and addressing how that gets operated in terms of ensuring a continuous flow past each of the intakes, would go a longer way towards ensuring instream values in Waipiʻo Valley and Wailoa Stream are being met. I just think of the water, Waipiʻo has a lot of water. Taking a small amount as a backup as an alternative for drinking water supply is kind of an easy ask versus the millions and millions of gallons taken by the Lower Hāmākua Ditch that gets lost in the system.
Thanks for explaining that. Then the wells, do you know more?
In terms of the groundwater geology?
Those sporadic periods at when Hawaiʻi Department of Water Supply utilized those ground water sources do you do any more about why and when?
I don’t know, they don’t necessarily line up to low flow conditions per se, but I’m not sure why exactly they operate them at those short intervals or just to keep them operational.
It’s related to those groundwater wells. If you do the 1.4 MGD into the streams, do you have any idea about how much more they’ll have to pump that groundwater and what it would cost them? Also, whether they’ve raised that issue at all?
If they had 150 million gallons of storage, I don’t think they’ll have to operate them at any more so than they currently have. I don’t know where the breakeven point is in terms of surface water storage and existing water demands or future water demands because they have not updated their water use and development plan since I think 2003. There is a big difference between 115 million gallons of storage and 165 million gallons of storage, but their current system demand is 1.8 million gallons per day. It’s either somewhere around 100 days of storage or 80 days of storage, that’s for just utilizing surface water and assuming no additional surface water. Again, the ability to capture runoff events from Kohākōhau and from Waikoloa to even when there’s three days of high flow events, they can fill up a reservoir pretty quickly. They have.
So, they’ve never really raised any issue about extra cost for them for using more groundwater?
The Waikoloa wind farm that was tied to the pumpage of certain groundwater wells for the county has not been fully utilized so they have been sued in terms of the violation of that power purchase agreement with the operator of the wind farm. I don’t know if it would cost them more or if they would be able to utilize existing electricity that they are already needing to pay for. Obviously pumping wells costs more money than letting the surface water flow into their system.
What would it cost to rehabilitate that 50-million-gallon reservoir?
It kind of depends on Dam Safety’s questions. There was some thought that they could just re-line it, but then I think they needed a new engineering study to look at the subsurface around the reservoir to make sure it’s stable.
The foundation, we’ll see what the community says come April 18th.
Ayron, do you know what the timetable is for updating the Water Use and Development Plan is?
I would have to defer to Planning Branch. I don’t know if Neal is still in in the room, but I’m not usually in on those conversations.
But that’s part and parcel of all of this, putting everything in context would be helpful.
If you look at the numbers, the most recent demands are somewhere around 1.4 MGD and then I’ve estimated the impact assuming a demand of 1.8 MGD. I’m already providing some buffer in terms of extreme demand from that system. I also know that there’s additional developments possibly in the works, but whether they have allocations from the system, that doesn’t come across our desk. We just look at their water audits.
It’s difficult to judge, put it in context. PUBLIC TESTIMONY
I wasn’t actually planning to comment, I wanted to learn more about what was going on with Waikoloa so I could learn more about what was going on with the water and also with the kalo farmers who want more water to grow kalo. That’s basically all I have to comment on.
Did you get the notice of when the public meeting is going to be? Thursday, April 18th, 5:30 to 7, Waimea Community Center. Ayron, have you received any comments from Hawaii Department of Water at this point?
No, and we sent the draft Instream Flow Standard Assessment Report to both Department of Planning at the County of Hawaii and the Department of Water Supply and I’ve been in email communication with Department of Planning, but DWS has not been responsive. We do have a meeting scheduled for next week or the following week with them so I’m sure this will get brought up.
That’d be helpful just to get some coordination.
Ayron, are you holding meetings with DHHL as well on this?
Yes.
Are the ranchers involved in some of this discussion with you as well?
Not too much. The primary management action being proposed is below the County’s intake and so I’m not really concerned about the small amounts of water diverted by Parker Ranch. The County delivers very little water for agriculture, some, but it’s not for ranching per se. The Department of Ag system, separate from this system, delivers to other ranchers.
