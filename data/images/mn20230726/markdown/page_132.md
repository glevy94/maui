this is in every plan.

So we talk about authority and purpose, the framework which I went through in the water use and development plan, which talks about islandwide demand forecasts, supply availability for urban and agriculture, conservation, existing and planned sources, alternatives and transfers, and I believe there's a discussion about how we transfer water around the island because we have the infrastructure to do that.

The Adler report talked about certain uncertainties such as in-stream and appurtenant rights, Hawaiian Homeland alternative source costs, alternative source impacts to aquifers, and the recharge rates and -- and pumping effects to streams. What we added here is a contingency section that offers a list of strategies on what to do about it. And so I would encourage you to read that when the public review draft comes out, and I'll get into that in more detail.

The plan implementation is how we allocate water, how we invest in infrastructure, you know, the reasonable and beneficial uses is defined first through the water use permits, and then we allocate water on a first-come, first-served basis with an adequate facilities review. I might add that when we do allocate water, we also look at reasonable and beneficial uses, ensure that conservation measures are employed, ensure that -- require them to connect.
