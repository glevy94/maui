**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** These -- these are your tactics. What indicators are you using to determine whether your tactics are successful so that the public feels a sense of high confidence in drinking that water?  
**MS. MOODY:** So that's a -- that's a challenging data point to track. Obviously, we continue to take feedback from the community. If they're drinking bottled water, if they're not using their water, is that something where we can have conversations, actually go into their home and look at the water in their home and see if there's a specific issue that can be addressed. We have seen a distinct down-shift in reports and calls of concerns and things like that over the last six months or so, and so we hope that's indicative that people are starting to have confidence in their water again. But the challenge with public trust is that's a hard thing to quantify, and so all we can continue to do is act to show, sustain that we continue to hold to our word.
