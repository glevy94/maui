The facility, all of Red Hill, will identify any historical events that may have occurred at Red Hill that we're not currently actively pursuing. We will begin the process of active remediation or exploration as needed once we don't have fuel in the hill. Right now, that risk is not really worth starting to drill and explore; the priority is defueling. As we move forward, we will look at Red Hill as a holistic site and identify what site remediation needs to occur. This is a long-term effort. The Navy is committed to the environmental restoration of Red Hill in the long term, so we anticipate a complete, comprehensive site assessment that could take several years. Remedial project management work will be occurring with project engineers who are down in the details, looking at aerial view footage of the facility as a whole, pulling up historical data from the archives, and identifying anything that could have potentially been located or a certain piece of equipment. Do we need to pull soil from this location or things of that nature? Right now, we have very active efforts at Adit 3 because of the events in 2021, and we have specific efforts at Adit 6 following the AFFF events. Right now, monitoring is the key goal through defueling to make sure nothing has changed in the landscape, and then we'll pursue the active remediation portion and site assessment.
