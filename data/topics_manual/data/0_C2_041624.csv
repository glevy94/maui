Update on Implementation of Waimea Watershed Agreement, Waimea, Kauaʻi
Dr. Ayron Strauch, Stream Protection and Management Acting Branch Chief
Staff shared a brief update on the status of the Waimea Watershed Agreement which is yet to be accepted by all parties. Chair Chang present.
Can you go back to the previous slide, please? Do you have a guess on how much water we took over this past weekend and do you have a survey on what’s left? Things like this I would think are at risk isn’t it?
Believe it or not this structure has survived pretty high flows and Waimea’s flows were not as substantial as Koloa relatively speaking or Wailua over the past weekend. I’ll let...or Hanapēpē.
Or ʻEleʻele. 65
KAA (Kekaha Agriculture Association) has a camera on the system, so they should be able to know. I’ve been busy and I have not had a chance to reach out to see if their infrastructure is still in place. I’m sure they’ll be available to answer questions.
I’ve got, are they here? Delanie and Josh. 
Josh Uyehara is here from KAA.
Good afternoon, Chair, members of the Commission, Josh Uyehara here with KAA. On that particular question, I would actually defer to Mike Faye who’s also on the Zoom, he’s our Executive Director.
Thanks, Chair, and Commissioners. The question I think was asked was did that infrastructure survive this past weekend? Yes, it did, it’s operating well. One thing Ayron didn’t mention is that besides the CWRM and USGS monitoring stations, we monitor the flows also at some of these locations, not all of them. That gate that is in that last picture that you saw, we have monitoring devices on there, measurements that we can take at that gate, so we know how much water is going out or we think we know how much. We compare it against the CWRM number just to make sure we’re in sync. That survived. If you looked at that picture the water level basically came up to the that platform and the concrete structure over the intake screen and completely covered the whole bottom of the valley there. That happens about maybe half a dozen times a year.
Just out of curiosity, how old are these systems? Josh, Mike, do you know?
The original system was built in 1912 up there at Waihulu, the lower part in 1908. We installed that automatic gate about two years ago, three years ago.
Let me just preface that. Commissioners, I know we had brought a stream diversion works permit application to you folks in January and that got deferred based on discussions that KIUC had proposed modifications to the diversions and installation of gaging equipment. With the withdrawal of the pump storage hydro project, you folks decided to defer that, so KAA, Kekaha Agriculture Association and Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative were going to meet together on that and the plan was to bring it back to you folks at this Commission meeting. However, last week when we met with the parties, they are still in discussions as far as costs, but you folks had also asked for a briefing just to see where we are at on the implementation of the mediation agreement. That’s why we asked Ayron to provide you folks that update. Dawn Huff is also here for KIUC along with their representative, Jordan Inafuku and they can have answer any questions we may have.
Dawn, did you want to share anything or are you here for questions? 
I see that your lawyer is here, too, Jordan Inafuku.
Aloha, Chair.
I see ADC, Lyle Roe is here. Did you want to add anything?
Nope, I’m just here to answer questions as they occur and as I can answer them.
Doug Codiga is representing.
Hey, good afternoon, Chair and Commissioners. Doug Codiga, outside counsel for the Kekaha Ag Association and Josh will be representing KAA. Just here to answer any questions.
I take it, Dean, they’re going to come back after they’ve had more time to talk and resolve funding issues?
Correct, I haven’t touched base with them this week yet, but hopefully we’ll bring that back to you at next month’s Commission meeting.
Next month you think you’ll come back?
Your report, it’s independent of what KIUC, the withdrawal of the project? Okay. Delanie and Josh, Jonathan, or Ashley, do you just have no place to go and you wanted to stay with? You’re welcome to come up.
Chair, for the record DHHL is one of the parties to the agreement and I like the rest of the screen am here to answer any questions if you have.
I thought you guys were hiding out over here with us or something. 
Chair, it’s your fault, you gave them cookies.
If it only takes cookies, I’m going to bring a big jar next time. Ashley, did you want to add anything? Okay, just hiding out inside our boardroom here, but thank you. I appreciate you guys being, everybody being available to address any comments that we have.
