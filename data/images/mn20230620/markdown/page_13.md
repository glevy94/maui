COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: So -- sorry.

COMMISSIONER BUCK: No, go ahead.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: I have a question on Recommendation 5, which focused on working with Maui DWS to support development of [fair] their water conservation programs. And given Maui DWS is, like, one of several providers, you know, how -- is there a -- when you say their water conservation programs, that is limited to Maui DWS. [This may be] Is there [broadened] broader [to] support for island-wide conservation.

MS. ROTH: Yes, absolutely. So the water audits themselves include more than just the DWS systems, but I think that's some good feedback. (Inaudible) is only referring to Maui DWS. So if that's something you want to amend --

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Yeah.

MS. ROTH: -- we can definitely do that.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Okay.

MS. ROTH: I will say that the -- the water audits, especially in the Lahaina area, are being used as part of our assessment of the water use permit applications that we've been receiving --

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Right.

MS. ROTH: (Inaudible), so we're trying to understand where efficiencies can be made not just in the public, but in the private systems as well.
