## Minutes

**RYAN IMATA:** No, that's very true and in fact, ‘Iwalani or Dean, can you allow me to share screen because I can't share screen right now. Still can’t. Okay, here we go. While the discussion was going on, I just did a super quick report from our database about well applications that we've gotten I think since 2019. From 2019 to today, we had, I don't have a summary number, but it looks like we got about 700 applications which amounts to about a 100 per year. If you look at the aquifer codes, a lot of these are for domestic wells in Hawaiian Paradise Park. Look at the aquifer code 80801, I think 80801 is Pāhoa, Hawaiian Paradise Park, most of them. If you look at all of the pages, I have like 18 pages. I think over half of them are in Hawaiian Paradise Park, so you're right here and you didn't make that up, 50% is about right. Some of them are in Maui, this is aquifer code 6. These are on O‘ahu, 3. And again, these O‘ahu applications some of them are individual domestic, but some of them require water use permits. These are Navy monitor wells which they're constantly pushing us on and we try to address those because we know that those are necessary to really address the needs of analyzing data around the Red Hill spill. Then there's a lot of Board of Water Supply wells and Barry Usagawa is here from the Board to kind of talk about the time frame that we've been faced with trying to get these approved for them, too. Again, these are sorted by aquifer codes. Freeing up our ability by delegating all of the Hawaiian Paradise Park wells will really significantly impact our time. Again, we have other challenges, we have staffing issues, we have designation issues, we have a lot of other issues so I'm not saying that this is a blanket fix that's going to allow us to get permits out this way, but it's another layer that impacts our ability to get work done. I hope that answered your question.

**BARRY USAGAWA, HONOLULU BOARD OF WATER SUPPLY:** Good morning, Chair and Commissioners, I guess I'll go first. We submitted testimony in support of the staff recommendations primarily because of the streamlining, just the well construction permit and administrative tax that are related as practical for administrative expedience. We make four points, one is that the staff is very knowledgeable and experienced and capable and under the direction of the director and the deputy working as a team, they determine all the conditions. Certainly the delays have been affecting our projects. It's been at least a year on a couple of them. Even delegated, I might point out that the staff still have to send the permit applications around for agency review and comment and that does take a while, in particular the State Historic Preservation Division. And while those delays are affecting us and it does affect the availability of water for affordable housing and it just exacerbates our water shortage potential from contamination, climate change, induced drought, and wildfires. The third point is that we are aware and bear the risk of the drilling of the exploratory well whether we can find a competent source of water, so we are aware of those risks and also that conditions will be placed on these permits. Primarily in O‘ahu, you have like three bites of the apple actually because it's designated except for Wai‘anae, and we're working on a petition to designate Wai‘anae. But delegating the well construction permit allows us to find a competent source to the well testing, developing the information that could be then used to determine the pump installation permit, the sizing, and of course the water use permit. Those two other
