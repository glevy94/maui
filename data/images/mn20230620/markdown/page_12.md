report back to the commission within one year with an update on the status of the USGS hydrological study of the Haiku Aquifer.

And 5. Commission staff will continue to work with Maui DWS to support development of their water conservation programs, including water loss control components that implement the findings of completed annual water audits.

I'd also like to mention that we have Council Member Shane Sinenci on the line along with Eva Blumenstein for DWS, and I believe Director Stufflebean is also in attendance virtually if you have additional questions.

CHAIR CHANG: Thank you.

MS. ROTH: And with that, I will be available for any questions you have.

CHAIR CHANG: Commissioners, do you have any questions for staff?

COMMISSIONER BUCK: Maybe a quick recommendation on your Recommendation 3 is all-encompassing; you might want to at least recognize this soon-to-be-formed East Maui Water Authority or something just to -- just to make sure that we're aware of what's going on 'cause that probably includes three or four of these annual meetings.

MS. ROTH: Yes, absolutely. And that was something that was discussed during public testimony and in conversations with the County.
