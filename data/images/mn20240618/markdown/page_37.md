## Minutes

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Originally, there was contemplation on a phase one and a phase two and the phase one was really done in anticipation that there would be a phase two. But now there's not going to be a phase two so we said okay, we got to go back and figure out what is essential. What was planned here that was agreed upon because that can be costed so that you can develop a dollar number that then KIUC is considering to contribute to then a whole new capital improvement plan because we've agreed that just doing a phase one as originally contemplated, it may not be optimal. The phase one made sense in the context of being a follow on phase two, but if you're not going to have a phase two, then you might use the money differently, but you got to figure out how much money and the money goes back to the agreement which was the phase one. You got to get that before you can get the money, then you can redesign with that money the best system for now.

**DAWN HUFF:** Aloha Chair, thank you. I just wanted to clarify we understood the three steps as you described them with the scope being the first step. From our perspective, the scope is the 2018 plan that everyone reviewed and approved, that is the scope for KIUC's commitment here, from our perspective. I won't speak for anybody else, any of the other parties on that, but that is what we are working on getting a cost estimate for, a current cost estimate for. Once we have that, then we can follow up with the other working parties and the Commission, but I do also want to clarify for the record we are not open to expanding our scope beyond what was reviewed and approved. That is the limit of what we are willing to do, that was our commitment.

**CHAIR CHANG:** That's clear, that's helpful, Dawn. So, we're looking now at the July meeting.

**DEPUTY UYENO:** Correct.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Make it happen, in spite of all the vacations.

**CHAIR CHANG:** And Dawn, there's a commitment by KIUC to complete the scope and the cost estimate, Dawn?

**DAWN HUFF:** We are working on it, we do have conflicts with the currently scheduled working group meeting in July, as well as the Commission meeting in July. I will have to work with Dean on some dates on when we can get back to you. Once we have the cost estimates, then we can follow up on the timing piece, but in the interim I will check with Dean on some other options for dates to meet with the working group parties at least.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** This will be my last time I see the West Kaua ªi folks. Aloha, I wish you well, hope this gets resolved.
