Briefing on Moloka‘i Water Plan Preliminary Draft by Maui Department of Water Supply
Residents of Moloka‘i’s West side for 10 years. • There are many ecological issues & the current system doesn’t provide sufficient water to address those issues. • Hoping Townscape can create a plan to bring all residents together. • Townscape has been good at listening to all the voices on the island.
Sherri Hiraoka & Bruce Tsuchida, Townscape, Inc.
Katie Roth of the CWRM Planning Branch introduced Sherri Hiraoka and Bruce Tsuchida with Townscape, Inc. Townscape shared a preliminary water use and demand presentation for the island of Moloka‘i including water resource issues, existing water production, future water demand, and a framework for allocating water. There was much discussion over increased allotments and cheaper water delivery for the West end of Molokaʻi. After extensive community outreach, they discovered shared values among the residents and received constructive feedback on an earlier draft proposal.
Thanks. This is really helpful just to see you, Bruce and Sherri. I was wondering you know in your growth projections when there's low growth to high growth that's growth in demand? I guess I'm thinking about this as like you see growth sometimes the assumption is population but you could have the same population or declining population wanting to do ag and have increased production. So that's a little bit disentangled in the following slides but can you speak more to how you constructed that framework for growth because I think it needs to be on really unpacked.
Well, we're actually just kind of revising all of that right now. The difficulty we're having is just in the kind of information we can find. I know for like the Honolulu Watershed Management plans we really tie the water demands to a per capita number. It's been difficult to do that for Moloka‘i just because there are a number of private systems and, just being able to figure out, just tie that to specific numbers. So, I think for in our revisions we're trying to just take another look at all of that. We had done I think a more broad brush like you were suggesting where it was a growth in water demand, a 0.5 increase in water demand, but yeah we're taking another look at all of that.
I guess...oh, sorry go ahead.
Can I comment here just briefly? Part of the problem here for the demand projections is there's a major difference in what position, politics, community focus. A major difference between many of the folks who are living on the west end of the island and other folks, central and east Moloka‘i. Many of the folks on the west end say they want and need and should have a lot more water, especially for agriculture and other folks in central and east Moloka‘i have the position that west has always been dry. It's never been good agricultural land and therefore should not be demanding water from other parts of the island to satisfy agricultural use that doesn't belong there. So those are two very different positions, obviously. And we don't have at this point in time a good answer for those differences in position relative to water and water supply.
Sure, and it's not your folks job to have to arbitrate that, I guess. But I guess what this reminds me of is last month's meeting on the East Honolulu and how we calculate, how we think about water use in general, not just here. Agricultural water use needs to be cheap to support agriculture but it's not an, you know it's not a high value. So, like if somebody in the southwest on the continent is a purveyor, they'd rather sell it to somebody who can pay a higher rate than a farmer. And given Moloka‘i's aspirations to be a certain kind of landscape, I think it'd be useful to disaggregate kind of how we think about demand and not just agricultural and domestic or municipal but also like unpacked regionally because the value and access to water is, value is high on West End, access is low. And it's plentiful. I really appreciate those pie charts because I've been around the discussions around the Kualapu‘u, but I had not seen the whole island in view. And I think regionally the value as you pointed out, the value sets but also like for the O‘ahu Water Plans, we don't really have to deal with sort of population growth and agriculture are usually in the same areas except maybe Central. So, like really thinking about how the metrics are appropriate for Moloka‘i and then different sectors might be helpful. And I'll think about how maybe if there's a way to sort of display the data or calculate things that might be more helpful for people to see or for you folks to think about. I just wanted to comment on that. You know that projections of growth, because Moloka‘i doesn't, having spent time with folks there, population growth is something they're quite afraid of. Maybe really unpacking that in terms of what growth and water needs are in the future. Am I being clear?
Yes. Bruce, Sherri, thank you very much for your work and I know your work and I know what you put into it and so I really appreciate how challenging this is and what you're dedicating in terms of your talent and your time to produce this plan. I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that the values are shared and I'm wondering whether or not using those values as guideposts for resolving the demand battles could be an effective way to proceed in the next steps ahead because if you said they're broadly shared that means West Side folks and East Side folks all believe in those things. So, isn't it a way to test solutions or plan action items by saying, what does this do? Does this align with our values or does this meet a need that has emerged or exists over time or will emerge in the future but doesn't really align with our values? Because then you have to revisit the values in that case. So, I would just encourage, you know, if we make this a tug of war over your needs versus my needs, you know you got winners and losers. But if we elevate the discussion to values that we share then how do we all participate in and manage this resource in a way that is consistent with those values and then maybe that has to change our demand profile and so forth. But rather it be a personal battle of West Side guys won this one, Eastside guys won that one. It's about no, our values prevailed and we adjusted our behavior and our expectations because we all believe in those values. So, I'll leave that with you or do you want to comment on that? Do you think that it’s a pipe dream? Or is that a perfect world, yeah it works on paper but not in reality?
Thank you, Neil. I would say that I think that that's what we were hoping to do with the values and we actually did dig a little bit deeper and under each of the values we do have some principles and took some goals and principles to really strive for. And our intent was to use all of that, as you were saying, to help identify water resource options and then to kind of look at those and say, okay what seems to make sense now. Not just you know yes, that can provide water for this demand, but does that align with the values and the goals and the principles. As far as whether or not that's a pipe dream, we'll see. We're gonna try. I'm sure that some of the aligning will feel very natural and will make a lot of sense and some of it might be a little bit more difficult and we'll have to do a lot more work. So, we're gonna try.
Well, I think it's the right approach and good luck with it. A couple more thoughts, Commissioner Miike. While I was pleasantly surprised by that, I was shocked not to see more discussion of watershed management and the threats to watershed represented by an ungular population that is really getting out of control. Did I miss it or are they not speaking about that?
They are speaking about that. We were just trying to figure out what to present in a short amount of time.
Okay, okay. Sherri Hiroaka: But yes, that did come up.
Well no, I have to comment here though, Neil. I understand your question and as you know for the watershed plans we've been doing for Board of Water Supply for the various watersheds on O‘ahu, we've dug pretty deeply into watershed management issues and ideas and potential projects. However, for Moloka‘i any depth of watershed management thinking and planning is not and I have to emphasize is not part of our scope. The Water Department not to put words in their mouth, but basically said that's not their purview and that's not the kind of plan that they can or will fund for Moloka‘i Water. So, although there is some mention of those issues and principles in our preliminary draft plan, we do not have the scope or capacity to dig deeply into those issues. Very important clearly but will not be part of this plan.
I mean there's not much to if we keep letting the source be degraded, there's going to be less and less to distribute no matter how you look at it. And when I look at those values you got plenty of places to put those points. You know there's so many of those values address the issue of, are we caring for the ‘āina at the source of where this water is? Are we encouraging the rain to fall? Are we capturing it and having it recharge and so forth. I don't know, I get maybe you're getting some pushback on that issue on creep of mission or mission creep or scope creep, but you can't talk about water without talking about source and the management of that source. The last thing is and this came up in an earlier conversation are you looking at the effect, the relationship between increased agricultural use and recharge because I saw that big spike in planned agricultural use. So, is that going to have a beneficial effect? If we make that investment to take that leap of faith then we're going to take water and I don’t know whether it's coming from another ahupua‘a or whatever and put it on the agricultural crops, is that going to yield an increase in the underlying groundwater aquifer?
I guess I'm not sure how much you would want to see about that. I don't think that we could do any specific studies. I mean a lot of that is going to depend on the kind of agriculture, the type of irrigation practices, and whatnot. So, it's something that we can mention as a possibility, but I don't think it's something that we could quantify.
I guess that's the point. Yes, please mention that because you do aerial spray that you know all this water, a lot of evaporation and so forth. You can put a million gallons out there and it has very little effect versus more effective best practice delivery systems that are way more efficient and have the beneficial effect on the natural systems, I think gotta be in this report somewhere.
Okay, thank you. Thank you. Larry.
First to comment on what Neil just said. It seems to me that the more efficient you are in your irrigation practices the less water goes down to the aquifer. It'll never leak so, that's an issue. In my experience with Moloka‘i and past Water Commission hearings, when you have a public hearing you are viciously attacked, but when the meeting is over people come up and are very gracious about it. So, take it with a grain of salt what you get. You know seems like you're getting personally attacked. My main question is looking at your map about various aquifers and the amount of water being used now, it seems to be that unless you start diverting water from the streams two or three beyond Kalaupapa, you’re about maxed out on surface water usage. So, it seems inevitable that if you're going to have population growth decided by how people, where they want to live, you're going to have to move water across ahupua‘a. The only alternative is that you force people to move to ahupua‘a that have a lot of water and I don't think that's reasonable. So, I think it's inevitable that you're going to have to begin to share water across and no matter how people divide, unless they want growth that's going to happen.
They don't.
Thank you.
Sherri and Bruce, you know sitting here at DLNR what I've come across in many communities but Moloka‘i in particular, it is just the mistrust of government. And I think it's a missed opportunity by the county to not, watershed management I mean that is critical to the people on Moloka‘i. And sometimes I think we put ourselves in these little vacuums and we say okay that’s out of our lane, you know maybe that's a DLNR, that's the county, but the people on Moloka‘i they look at it in a very holistic way and when we don't look at it through their lens I think we really miss an opportunity. Because you know people on Moloka‘i and they are the most territorial people. I mean Western people do not tell Eastend people or Central people what to do. And they’re all good with that. I mean they're very respective, but I don't know when you talk about community, I mean what kind of community engagement and participation have you been getting? You know it is a challenging community, but Bruce you are probably one of the best people in this area to do this and your opening comment was that this is the most contentious, complex. I would say from DLNR I'm really challenged with Moloka‘i, too and I realize you got to just show up and you have to be present. What are some of the challenges that you're finding because this is such an important plan for them and it's for us as well. What are you finding?
Well, I would say that there's technical side stuff and then there's community side stuff. Technical side stuff it's just and we've experienced this with any and all of the water planning that we've done. It's just the type of information we can get if we get information from different sources that don't always match up, different types of data sets so trying to figure out okay what can we do with what we have that seems to make sense and then what assumptions do we have to make to kind of fill in the gaps. So, I would say that's part of it for Moloka‘i specifically there are a number of, there are more water systems than we've had to work with in the past so there's that public and private. And in some cases there's some interconnectedness between the systems so that makes it a little bit more interesting. I think on the technical side there's that. On the community side you know people have been really gracious. They’re very sure to let us know what they think and what they want, but they've been very gracious and we've been very appreciative about that. But water is a precious resource and the water use especially geographically is changing and things that are in the land use plan are different from what you know the land uses that have been there in the past and so that is going to have implications for the different resources. And I think that's what we're coming up against and so the community is challenging us to help them figure out how to move forward on that.
Yeah, more specifically if I may as you folks will know, one of the major problems with land use and planning and water for Moloka‘i is Moloka‘i Ranch. Their water system is from all accounts that we've heard dilapidated, deteriorated and in very bad shape. Their water rates are reportedly the highest in the United States. West End folks are saying they need a lot more water and they need water at much more reasonable rates, but they're not gonna get that anytime soon given the status quo with the ranch. The ranch has been up for sale for many years, hasn't been sold. Will it be sold? Who knows, but unless and until there can be new owners and new managers for the West End water system, I'm afraid that these problems will persist. So, no easy solution to that.
I just want to speak up a little bit for the Moloka‘i community because you have to pay the price for some of the post-traumatic stress that's been imposed upon them and people didn't listen. People, you know, colonized, people did things that really affected them, and they weren't a part of the process. And so yeah you take some blows maybe or you get some of that blowback as soon as you walk in the door. But when you sit down, they’re at the table vigilantly. They show up, they're articulate, it's multi-generational, and when you start speaking to values, that's what I'm so hopeful about the values, they're really beautiful values and they just want to see alignment with those values. And you would keep the discussion there and then be true to that. Don't just waha, it can’t just be words it has to be action and align with that. Things fall into place a lot easier than if you just have kind of a defensive action about, oh I didn't do that or she did that or he did that or the ranch did that and so forth. They don't lead to good places, but if we can get the values we can lead to better places.
I do have a question for Townscape. When you did these meetings were you meeting with people sort of communities separately in place? Did they have an opportunity, you hear everybody, but do they have an opportunity to hear each other directly or go to those places you see? I mean okay so that has been part of the process?
We did both. We did individual small group. We did kind of pop-ups in different communities where we had a table set up. People could drop by; we were open for like several hours. We could talk story, that kind of thing. And then we also did have the larger community meetings with everyone.
But do they have an opportunity to hear each other sort of outside this draft? I know they probably talk on island, but to see the implications of if West End needs more water then these guys might not, might see a decline. You know has there been the ability to have that discussion and then also in your plan are you including, I've seen this done you know like potential scenarios as straw man, straw people to shoot at. Is that incorporated into what you folks are gonna do like here's one scenario, what do you think? Here's another. Is that in there?
That is something that we're kind of still working on because we are still revising the water demands, but that is something that’s pretty interesting. It sounds like something that could be helpful in I guess helping people to understand the perspectives of the different people and the different parts of the island and the different types of water needs. So, thank you.
Yeah, I think I saw it in written testimony people don't want to be feeling like they're pitted against each other so how can this process try to bring people together or understand where that compromise lies? You know here's one extreme situation, all the water goes to West end; okay, that's unacceptable here. Okay, keep it all on the East end; okay that's unacceptable. So, it might help people sort of get more tangible and focus on solutions, so I just want to suggest that. And I'm sure there are other good ideas that come out of community.
Yes, my name's Norman Rizk and I came to kind of flesh out some of the things that Sherri and Bruce are talking about the West end. I'm the president of the West Moloka‘i Association. It's an organization that represents owners of 811 properties in the West end and the owners and their families are actually about 2,000 people. The whole population of Moloka‘i is 7,300 so it's not a small group and what I would hope to do is give you a brief view of the West end from the residences’ point of view, filling out some of the things that were just discussed by Sherri and Bruce. And I just want to say from the beginning that we have a lot of confidence in Sherri and Bruce trying to tie all this together and bring people together around a solution which I do believe is very possible given the amount of water on Moloka‘i. We're only using nine percent of the sustainable yield right now. The concern has been this, on the West end, has been mainly because of our numbers and being on the driest part of the island. We still only get about five percent of the water and we get our water from and our rate payers too, Moloka‘i Public Utility, which is a utility owned by an offshore company Guoco, a corporation domiciled in Hong Kong. So, it's not just the ranch, it's the owners of the ranch and historically management decisions are pretty much forcibly based on the oversea owner's financial goals, not on the needs of the people of the West end. This was most obvious in 2008 when they tried to shut down the whole water system and we were threatened with getting 50 gallons a day of water by trucking. So, this is why it's such a sensitive point. Things are better now to a certain degree, but access to affordable water is still a huge issue. Right now, we're provided with only very expensive potable water at about seven to eight dollars per thousand gallons. And because our largest lots are Papohaku Ranch Land lots are zoned agricultural, we are required to devise “farm plans” dedicating at least 51 percent of the property on the lot to general agricultural use to obtain a building permit. So, this is nearly impossible without any ag water. So that's a major problem. Now 50 years ago if you look back, the West end development plans from these offshore companies were mainly those of a high-end resort, but I would say the West end in the 25 years I've been there has morphed into a community that shares many characteristics with the rest of the island. Our HOA or Homeowner Association, in fact, just changed the CC&Rs to encourage rather than prohibit commercial agriculture. It's part of what Sherri was talking about. Essentially none of our members really want a densely populated resort with widespread commercial franchises, so I'd like to put to rest any fears in the community that granting water would mean explosive growth. Nobody in the West end wants explosive growth either and people move there for the values. So, in fact if you do a survey as we've been doing this last month of all of our owners on the larger lots, these are 50 to 20 acre lots, about a third of them right now living on about 450 acres say they want to use water right now for small-scale agriculture, reforestation, and erosion control. And the erosion control is a big deal because of the ungulates trampling the land and silting out the reefs every time it rains. (Chair Chang exits meeting briefly.) So, I think what West enders would like would be to grant an appropriate amount of ag waters for these purposes. We could work out the exact recommendations with Townscape. We'd also have to figure out the infrastructure of financing and whether there's any Federal infrastructure dollars that could help. Many people in the West end would like the County to take over the water system since we're not sure that Guoco has our best interests in mind or shares our values. If we had some ag water we could supplant the use of potable water for planting which is really inappropriate, not financially viable. And it would also settle the litigation and the increasingly divisive disputes over rights to groundwater from the Kualapu‘u Aquifer which is being potentially oversubscribed. So, these things are all possible. It’s a question of setting aside the differences and coming together to express values that I think many, many people share. And about Townscape, you know a lot of our people were really upset after the first draft, but I think Sherri and Bruce have really, really addressed that. We had like 150 letters and emails the first draft, but we have a lot of confidence in them and we very much appreciate their working, in as Bruce said, a contentious environment. And we want to collaborate with them. That's what I’d like to say about it. Mahalo for your attention and it is true that your eventual decision will help determine the fate and character of the West end of the island, but I do think it is a solvable dilemma and the resources are there. It's more a question of people coming together.
Commissioner Hannahs thanks Townscape, oral testifiers, and those who provided written testimonies.
So, when might we see you back with something, with the next step, Sherri?
Well, it’s going to be several months. We’re revising still the water demands and then we need to go through the process of identifying the water resource options, putting together a public review draft to share with the community, and at that point we can come back and brief you on that.
Six months, two months, five months?
It’ll probably be early next year.
Right, hope to see it before the end of my term in June.
