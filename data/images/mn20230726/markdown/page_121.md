as far as climate change was the change in precipitation.

CHAIR CHANG: Oh, okay.

DR. IZUKA: Yeah, not sea level rise.

CHAIR CHANG: I see.

DR. IZUKA: But that is a consideration. I think there are other people researching that.

CHAIR CHANG: Okay, all right. Thank you. Aurora.

COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI: Thanks for this. I just was wondering, is there a way that we can dynamically explore scenarios for planning, or does it have to be run—do we have to—does the commission staff need to give you the parameters? Do you have to run it and give it back, or will there be a future way where we can say play plan or play God a little bit and say if this happens, what happens in Ko‘olau? If we change this dial, what happens to these different response variables?

DR. IZUKA: You know, that is a really good question because that is something that the USGS and, you know, else—throughout the USGS, nationwide, is kind of thought about because for us—you know, as you say, if you—the water commission came up with this scenario and you wanted us to test it, then we'd run the model and then we'd write a report and then, you know, so many years later you get the report.
