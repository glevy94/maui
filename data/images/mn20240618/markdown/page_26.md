**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** Okay, it just hasn't been done yet.

**COMMISSIONER MIKE:** Can I interrupt on there because let me see if Barry is still around. I think long time ago I told Barry, why don't you guys ask for reservations for the public water systems so that you don't have to be competing with private people all the time? So it is a possibility.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** Exactly, that's correct for household use, for the rest of the public if you will. That's exactly right.

**COMMISSIONER HANNAHS:** Back to your earlier point, Larry, in my years on the Commission, we never tried to give every everything they wanted. We tried to balance as best we could and would you agree that the East Maui contested case discussion might be relevant here where every stream was different. Some streams were highly compromised and so forth and those we put a minimal wetted pathway, other streams were really heavy users and so forth. We treated those, made sure they had enough for their public trust uses and then we withdrew what we could to get to DHHL lands and so forth, but it was very much a balancing act. We don't, especially now with DHHL’s additional infusion, much needed infusion of cash that'll allow more development, I'm really keen to hear how that's going to change their reservation needs in the future because we got to refigure, you got to rebalance again. Now this is just stream, now there's a whole different issue and much of their needs will be supplied by groundwater, I assume, but when it comes to streams it really is a challenging balancing.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** This was a follow-up question, we asked whether we can make reservations. Do you think we have a duty to make reservations for other people for future needs or public trust users?

**KATIE ROTH:** I don't know if I would comment on without and that's maybe a legal…

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** You said we have a duty to DHHL.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** My question relates to this.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** Do we have a duty to take into account the needs of other public trust users? That's the question, maybe that's a question for the AG.

**COMMISSIONER KAGAWA-VIVIANI:** I think my question relates to this and I'll just say it's a bit of a red herring to frame other [inaudible], but DHHL has a particular status, correct? Katie can you run down the history of that ruling? My understanding is DHHL has this level of priority because of conditions of Statehood and this is somewhat
