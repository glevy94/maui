**ANDREW CHOY:** I think that is a question that we would like to know the answer, as well. Anecdotally, we've had some good working relationships with various counties of water supply. We continue to have dynamic conversations with them on how to fulfill the obligation of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act as a responsibility of the entire State, not just the Hawaiian Home Lands Department. We do feel that there is some level of collaboration and contribution needed from all parties. What that looks like is on a case-by-case basis.

**CHAIR CHANG:** Because do you include the cost of infrastructure when you're doing your development plans? Is the cost of developing a water infrastructure system part of your cost estimate?

**ANDREW CHOY:** Yes, when we develop our cost estimates it's both for on-site and off-site infrastructure.

**CHAIR CHANG:** That's great.

**COMMISSIONER MEYER:** That's a really good point, this is all about collaboration, working together, and sharing. Absolutely.

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** Hi Andrew, I guess to help sharpen Commissioner Meyer's question is that if the water supply for your development is coming from a public water utility, are you then sort of double dipping or double accounting for that water? Because the public Department of Water has a supply plan, a demand plan. You are submitting a water demand plan, as well. You don't need to answer that right away, but as you start getting into your development to again identify that to help us help planning, not to double account for the water.

**ANDREW CHOY:** Thanks for that question, Commissioner Katayama. We have been a lot more progressive and proactive in trying to reach out to the county Department of Water Supplies to make sure that their Water Use and Development Plan is inclusive of our water developments. A great example is actually on the Kauaâ€˜i County Department of Water Supply, they've worked really well with us in trying to outreach to our beneficiaries. They sat down with us, they went through the effort of planning meetings specifically for our beneficiaries to make sure that their input is included in their Water Use and Development Plan.

**COMMISSIONER KATAYAMA:** That's great and I think we'll get smarter and sharpen our focus on these things and Katie, thank you very much for your presentation. It really helped me zero in on specific statutes on how water reservations are made. One sort of comment is that you've identified several different water plans from resources, projects and if you were to look at the dates of when those plans were adopted, you find a sort of a long period. I guess my question is, is there a way to better synchronize the plans because
