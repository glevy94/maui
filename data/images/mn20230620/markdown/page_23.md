Land and Pine and Hawaiâ€˜i Water Services to integrate -- you know, to look at how we can integrate our systems better to most efficiently utilize the water in the area.

And then, finally, to address drought and system resiliency, we're formalizing demand response plans and mutual agreements with the private water purveyors to address water shortages. It was said earlier when -- we can declare a water shortage, but it's really helpful if all the other water companies on the island also declare a water shortage. So we're looking -- you know, we see that as a really important element.

We're developing wells to improve reliability as a -- as a contingency in areas that are dependent on surface water. The wells are -- you know, tend not to respond as quickly to -- obviously, rainfall events. And then we're looking to -- you know, three of -- three of our main water supplies in three of our main areas are the ditch systems, and so we'll continue relying on those, so we're exploring how we invest in those systems to make sure that they're -- they're adequately maintained. And we're assessing the Wailuku Water Company system and potentially other legacy systems as well.

So, in summary, the plan serves us as a long-term guide; that's the value of it. It provides us a framework in which to -- to plan our efforts, and I believe it's a good foundation that we can update. Obviously, that's mentioned.
