increases. And we're adding stream gauges and monitoring wells and other tools to assess what's happening with climate change.

In terms of source, we are -- for our central system -- you probably know Maui has 12 separate water systems, which is so interesting 'cause I'm fairly new here. On our central system, we're exploring new basal well development in the southern portion of the Waihee Aquifer and East -- East Maui well development as well.

And we're currently conducting a feasibility study to be followed by USGS assessment on the interaction between the groundwater and surface water and potential impacts from pumping the Haiku Aquifer.

For Upcountry, we're exploring new well development in the Makawao Aquifer and the Haiku to meet demand on the Upcountry meter priority list. And we're assessing the new raw water reservoirs to increase reliable supply with consideration adopted to other in-stream flow standards. And we're also considering alternative structures and processes to expedite the issuing of meters. And that's a whole 'nother meeting. I won't get into the meter list, but we're looking at about four or five different strategies to help us -- to help us address that meter list in a more efficient way.

And on the west side over at Lahaina-Kapalua area, Kaanapali, we're pursuing new wells and also working with Maui
