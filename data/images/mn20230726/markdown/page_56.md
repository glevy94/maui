preferred and asked of us from the regulators. 1633 did extend to 40 different PFAS analytes. 

COMMISSIONER HO: Right. 

MS. MOODY: So it is a more extensive, comprehensive look; it has lower detection levels. 537.1 and 533 combined give us a pretty complete picture of the primary group of PFAS, so -- and also to -- under long-term monitoring, we're collecting for 60-plus analytes of all sorts of other constituents such as volatile organic compounds and semi-volatile organic compounds and anything related to total petroleum hydrocarbons. So we are already doing a pretty comprehensive sampling program; this is just adding those 40 PFAS constituents in addition to that sampling. 

COMMISSIONER HO: And that (inaudible) of Waiapo will be moving forward -- 

MS. MOODY: So -- so Waiapo is sampled every period. Our sources are sampled at the beginning of every period of long-term monitoring. So we do a threat -- so there are seven periods in the plan. 

COMMISSIONER HO: Okay. 

MS. MOODY: So we do a -- kind of a baseline sample to make sure we're re-verifying that our source water is meeting safe drinking water standards, and then we move forward through that period. So we continue to sample the Waiawa Shaft, and we're committed throughout the defueling.
