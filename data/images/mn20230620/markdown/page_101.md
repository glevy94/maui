the Navy monitor wells with respect to the fuel tank farm. So this is the fuel tank farm right here.

And then water quality data from the monitor well -- so we don't have the expertise within groundwater to analyze water quality data, but thank you to Commissioner Seto for sending me this yesterday. Here are some websites that anybody can go to, the commissioners and general public can go to get water quality data from the monitor wells. So there's the -- DOH's Red Hill information website. There's the EPA's groundwater results application which was just released, I think, last month or two months ago. And then there's the Navy's Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Red Hill environmental website.

And that's basically all I -- oh-oh. Start the recording again?

DEPUTY MANUEL: Yeah, you can just press start recording, Kathy.

MS. YODA: It's connecting. Like it's not sensing or something.

CHAIR CHANG: So can we confirm --

DEPUTY MANUEL: Is it -- is it on --

MS. YODA: It's a hard connection.

DEPUTY MANUEL: Okay, there we go.

DEPUTY MANUEL: It came back.

MR. IMATA: Okay, there we go.
